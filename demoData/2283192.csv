,action,"FULL-TIME! Malaga dominated long portions of the game at La Rosaleda, but their efforts are eventually in vain as Atletico win 2-0. Goals from Koke and Filipe Luis turned the match for the visitors, who stay on course to try and overtake Sevilla in third place in LaLiga. The hosts, meanwhile, are still winless under Michel. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+1',action,There are three minutes of stoppage time.
90',action,"Rosales tries to whip in a cross from the right-hand side, but Gabi makes a block. Correa is picked out on the break for Atletico, but the Argentina international can only force Kameni into a good near-post save."
88',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Filipe Luis Kasmirski sub-in José María Giménez de Vargas . Gimenez is introduced for Filipe Luis, which should see Lucas move to left-back and the Uruguay international slot into the middle of midfield for the dying stages."
86',action,"Less than five minutes are remaining for Atletico to see out, with Lucas now sat just in front of the back four. Oblak makes a simple save, after Rosales brings a loose ball down in the box and swivels sharply. The Venezuelan really should have done better with that!"
84',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Antoine Griezmann sub-in Diego Roberto Godín Leal . Santos is picked out by a near-post corner delivery, but the substitute can only nod clear of the target. Atletico use the break in play to make a change, with Griezmann replaced by Godin. Lucas steps up."
82',action,"We're into the final 10 minutes at La Rosaleda, and it looks like another routine three points for Atletico. Simeone will be glad that despite missing a few key players, Los Colchoneros have battled to a much-needed win. Sandro races clear on the break and releases Santos on the right, but the substitute can only force Oblak into a diving stop."
80',action,"Malaga win themselves a free-kick on the right flank, which Sandro pings into the back post, but the away side hack clear for a corner. The resulting set-piece from the right-hand side comes to nothing. The hosts have had opportunities but haven't made the most of them."
78',action,"Sandro is picked out on the edge of the penalty box, before swivelling and firing a volley goalwards. Oblak makes a simple catch. That was a lovely effort, and for a minute it looked to be escaping from the Slovenian shot-stopper."
76',yellow-card,"Yellow Card José Luis García del Pozo. Recio leaves his mark in a poor tackle, which has the Atletico players arguing for a red. He gets yellow."
76',yellow-card,Yellow Card Juan Carlos Pérez López. Juankar gets a yellow card for a poor challenge.
76',action,"Less than 15 minutes remain for Malaga to stage a comeback, and it looks beyond the home side now. All of the possession and pressure has come to absolutely nothing for the hosts. That goal from Filipe Luis has killed the mood at La Rosaleda."
74',assist,Assist Fernando José Torres Sanz. Torres manages to feed a low pass into Filipe Luis' path.
74',goal,"Goal Filipe Luis Kasmirski. GOOOOOOOAL! FILIPE LUIS MAKES IT 2-0! Atletico almost manages to rob Ricca of the ball on the edge of the box, but Griezmann can't make the most of it. Filipe Luis, Torres and the Frenchman combine inside the area moments later, with the Brazilian managing to dink home a lovely finish from a tight angle. Kameni didn't have a chance."
72',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Sergio Gontán Gallardo sub-in Michael Nicolás Santos Rosadilla . Keko takes his leave, with Michael Santos introduced up top."
72',action,"Malaga are recycling the ball and pushing desperately for an opening. Sandro tries to spray a pass out to Rosales on the overlap on the right-hand side, but the ball fizzes out of play. Michel's men are falling short at the final hurdle."
70',action,"Torres and Griezmann aren't pressing too intensely, but it looks as though Atletico might need a second goal to kill this game off as a contest. Sandro is working hard up top to try and orchestrate a comeback, but a cross from the left-hand side is deflected behind."
68',action,"Malaga win themselves a corner on the left-hand side, with Simeone beginning to lose his patience a little with how far Atletico are on the back foot. The delivery is swung in, but sails wide of the back post. Lucas and Savic have been comfortable, but one goal from the hosts could swing the momentum massively here."
66',action,"Fornals plays a ball down the line for Ricca to chase, but the substitute can't quite get there. The hosts try to threaten down the same flank moments later, but an early cross is flicked to safety with ease by Savic."
64',action,"Oblak makes another simple catch to stop a Malaga attack in its tracks, with the Slovenia international not working up a sweat quite yet. Atletico seem happy to just sit back and absorb pressure, with Simeone not making any moves to try and freshen things up offensively."
62',action,"Less than half an hour remains at La Rosaleda, but Malaga are playing as if they won't score if they played all weekend. Keko and Sandro are trying to offer some bright movement to pick up little pockets of space, but Savic and Lucas are having it easy."
60',substitution,"Substitution sub-out José Rodríguez Martínez sub-in José Luis García del Pozo . Jose Rodriguez jogs off, with Recio introduced in midfield."
59',action,"The hosts are struggling to create anything, despite having the lion's share of the ball. Michel will be pleased with how Malaga are controlling play, but it isn't coming to anything at all."
57',action,"Kameni is called into action to make a simple catch, as Torres struggles to get any regular service up top. Atletico try to take the sting out of the game with some patient possession, but it comes to nothing. Jose Rodriguez tries to play a defence-splitting pass on the edge of the area, but it fails to pick out Sandro or Keko."
55',action,"Jose Rodriguez combines with Fornals on the edge of the penalty area, before play is released out to the left-hand side of midfield. The hosts are retaining possession very well indeed. Malaga switch play to the right, before a low cross from Rosales is hacked clear desperately by Savic. Keko was lurking."
53',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Thomas Teye Partey sub-in Ángel Martín Correa . Correa comes into the game on the right-hand side of midfield, with Partey taking his leave."
52',action,"Atletico are keeping themselves in formation, sitting very deep indeed. Essentially, Simeone's system is asking for the hosts to push on and leave gaps to exploit on the counter. Chances are at a premium in Andalucia tonight."
50',action,"Malaga are trying to get the ball forward as quickly as they can, but it isn't quite coming off for them in the final third. The incisive passes into the box aren't causing much in the way of trouble. Oblak hasn't had an actual save to make, save for denying a flick from Sandro in the first half."
48',action,"Oblak is forced to catch an easy cross from the right-hand side, with Atletico being asked more questions with direct, lofted balls. Juanfran is the target of a clipped pass over Ricca's head, but the Spain international can't get to the ball before it runs out of play. Fornals dances into the box and tries his luck with a stabbed finish, but it gets blocked."
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half! Malaga will be looking to get back into this one as soon as they can, but their approach hasn't flustered Atletico too badly. Savic and Lucas are both on bookings."
,action,"HALF-TIME! Atletico go into the break with a 1-0 lead over Malaga, courtesy of a close-range, opportunistic finish from Koke. The hosts have been direct and brash in their approach, but it hasn't brought any rewards yet. Michel has been fuming on the sidelines with the referee's decisions."
45',action,There is one minute of stoppage time at La Rosaleda.
43',action,"Keko is picked out by a cross from the right-hand side, with a neat back-heel from the ex-Eibar winger being saved easily by Oblak. That was a nice bit of invention from the Spaniard. Not long remains until the break, but Atletico are still defending with relative ease."
41',action,"Juanfran escapes down the right-hand side, but Juankar tracks back nicely to dispossess him. Michel's men are trying to force their way through via direct balls and long throws, but it isn't working so far."
39',action,"Oblak is happy to take his time over a goal kick, as Atletico are finding themselves under a little bit of pressure. Savic and Lucas are keeping things simple, with Los Colchoneros not taking any risks with their defending whatsoever. They will be looking to get into the break unscathed."
37',action,"Griezmann tries his luck from a narrow angle on the right, but Kameni isn't troubled whatsoever. Savic is in control as a long, lofted ball looks for Sandro over the top, as Atletico continue to enjoy all of the football being played directly in front of them."
35',action,"Malaga continue to ask questions with their direct passing, with Michel piling plenty of crosses into the box from all angles. Once again, Keko goes down in the penalty area claiming a foul, but the referee isn't interested at all."
33',action,"Keko tries to escape down the right, and he manages to earn a throw-in for his side. Yet again, it is Luis Hernandez to hurl in a long throw, but a flick-on is mopped up by Torres nicely. Juankar is picked out on the left, but Lucas heads clear his eventual cross."
31',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Stefan Savić. Savic is the next man to go into the book, with Simeone perhaps wanting to dip into his bench before long."
30',action,"The opening half an hour has been relatively even, but Atletico still find themselves ahead. With a quarter of an hour until the break, Malaga will be confident that they can ask Oblak a few more questions. Chances have been elusive at both ends, in truth."
28',action,"Simeone will be pleased with his side's start, even though they haven't dominated. They have weathered the storm and defended well. Ricca drives to the left byline and tries to curl a cross into the box, but Juanfran clears. Malaga might feel a little hard done by."
26',goal,"Goal Jorge Resurrección Merodio. GOOOOOOAL! KOKE MAKES IT 1-0! The Spain international is accidentally fed into the penalty area from the left-hand side, before surging to the loose ball after Torres turned well but was half-dispossessed. With Kameni in his face, the Atletico midfielder keeps his nerve to close a neat finish into the bottom-left corner."
26',assist,"Assist Fernando José Torres Sanz. Torres tries to turn in the box, but is half-dispossessed. The loose ball bobbles kindly out to Koke."
25',action,"Malaga keep trying to use their width to their advantage, but the deliveries into the penalty area haven't been good enough. Oblak is forced to come off his line to try and punch a ball away from Sandro's head, with the Spaniard going down under a clumsy challenge from the goalkeeper. The referee doesn't point for a penalty, however. Would have been harsh, as there was no intention there."
23',action,"Filipe Luis gallivants down the left-hand side and plays a one-two with both Koke and Torres. He battles to the byline and attempts to cut back a cross, but the ball rebounds off him and out for a goal kick. Malaga respond with a quick counter, but Lucas manages to dispossess an off-balance Keko in the box."
21',action,"Both teams continue to build their attacks up quite well, but they run out of ideas and craft in the final third. Michel will be pleased with how Malaga have set out their stall, they've moved the ball with purpose and haven't given Griezmann any opportunities at all."
19',yellow-card,Yellow Card Lucas Hernández Pi. Lucas gets a booking for a cynical tackle. That's the first card of the game.
18',action,"The hosts are doing well at present, with Kameni having much less to worry about in comparison to Oblak. Atletico counter through Partey, who helps them build down the right, before opening play out. Koke jinks inside, but Malaga continue to press well, forcing the visitors backwards constantly."
16',action,"Sandro plays a low pass into Fornals, who opens the play yet again for Malaga. A long, hopeful ball looks for Juankar on the left, but Juanfran makes a good headed interception. Sandro tries to shoot from the best part of 30 yards, but the ex-Barcelona striker's effort is charged down."
15',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Miguel Torres Gómez sub-in Federico Ricca Rostagnol . Miguel Torres takes his leave, with Ricca coming in as a like-for-like switch at left-back."
15',action,"Fornals opens play out to the right-hand side for Malaga, before Keko earns a corner from the byline. The initial set piece comes to absolutely nothing, but the hosts are putting pressure on with continual big balls forward and long throws. Miguel Torres isn't moving well after his fall."
13',action,"The hosts look to play direct, with a hopeful ball flicked over the top for Sandro to chase, but Savic easily nods the pass back to Oblak. After a slow start, Michel's men are looking a bit more competitive. Saul is the target of a direct lofted throughball for Atletico, but Kameni is off his line in a flash to mop up behind his back four."
11',action,"The hosts enjoy their first real spell of lengthy possession, which culminates in a hopeful ball down the right channel being hoofed clear by Lucas. Luis Hernandez launches a long throw into the area from the right-hand side, but a header from Camacho goes horrendously wide. That was terrible!"
9',action,"Atletico are keeping their banks of four organised, with Partey out on the left and Koke on the left. So far, Michel's men haven't truly got going. The hosts win a free-kick on the left-hand side, but a bending delivery from Sandro is headed to safety eventually by Savic."
7',action,"The away side are trying to impose themselves on this game early on, with Malaga sat deep and looking to transition at pace. Gabi and Koke combine from a short free-kick, before a curling delivery into the opposition penalty area sees Miguel Torres and Savic challenge for the ball. The two land awkwardly and look in pain."
5',action,"Simeone has been forced to use a few second-string personnel this evening, with Malaga just trying to counter at pace. Koke lines up a shot from long range, but the Atletico midfielder rattles a low shot within the grasp of Kameni. Simple save for the hosts' shot-stopper in the end."
3',action,"Kameni makes an easy claim from the right-hand side, with Oblak then called into action up the other end to gather up a loose ball. The visitors scamper down the left-hand side through Torres, before a cut-back into Griezmann's feet sees the Frenchman dispossessed easily. Malaga counter, but a cut-back from the right is blocked by Juanfran ahead of Fornals."
1',action,"We are underway in the first half at La Rosaleda! The hosts will be looking for a rare home victory to wake them from their league slumber, but Atletico have been looking unbeatable lately. Three points would really pile the pressure on struggling Sevilla."
