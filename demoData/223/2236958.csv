,action,"That's all from us for today, thanks for joining us and we hope you'll be able to join us again soon."
,action,"PSG get back to winning ways and close the gap on Ligue 1 leaders Monaco with a 2-1 over Lorient, thanks to an own goal from Benjamin Jeannot and a second half strike from Christopher Nkunku. Lorient did pull one back through Michael’s Ciani’s header, but they failed to threaten Kevin Trapp in the PSG goal thereafter."
,action,Full-time: Lorient 1-2 Paris Saint-Germain
90'+1',action,We’re into three minutes of added time now with PSG still looking the more likely of the two teams to score.
90',action,"Chance!! Nkunku gets in behind the Lorient defence after a good ball through from Pastore, but his shot is rushed and slices high over the bar from eight yards out."
88',substitution,Substitution sub-out Julian Draxler sub-in Hatem Ben Arfa . A second change for PSG now as sub-in Hatem Ben Arfa comes on in place of Draxler.
88',action,"Another chance for Cavani as he once again heads over the bar, this time from Di Maria’s cross. The striker may have been better off leaving that ball though as Draxler was unmarked behind him and doesn't look too happy."
86',substitution,Substitution sub-out Arnold Mvuemba sub-in Pierre-Yves Hamel . Another change for Lorient as they go in search of an equaliser with Mvuemba being replaced by sub-in Pierre-Yves Hamel.
85',action,"This game has lost its intensity now, although in truth it never had a huge amount, but PSG look as though they’re just looking to see this game out without throwing too many numbers forward."
83',yellow-card,Yellow Card Mathieu Peybernes. Peybernes has gone into the book for what appears to be dissent.
82',action,"Chance!! A big chance to PSG to seal it as Kurzawa whips in a cross from the left towards Di Maria in the middle, but the Argentine lets in run which catches Cavani by surprise, and he is unable to control it allowing Lecomte to claw it away."
81',substitution,Substitution sub-out Thomas Meunier sub-in Serge Aurier . Meunier is not going to be able to continue and sub-in Serge Aurier comes on in his place at right-back.
81',action,"Kurzawa gets in down the left hand-side of the penalty box and stands up a cross from the byline for Cavani to attack, but the ball is fractionally too high and his header loops over the bar."
79',action,Peybernes plays a long ball forward for Aliadiere to chase but Trapp is off his line quickly to gather the ball in at the edge of his area. Aliadiere has certainly made a difference for Lorient though.
77',action,Meunier is really struggling now as PSG just roll the ball about amongst themselves at the back.
75',yellow-card,Yellow Card Christopher Nkunku. Nkunku goes into the book for a high boot on Philippoteaux despite the midfielder’s protests.
75',action,"After a long wait, DI Maria hits a pretty tame effort from the free-kick straight into the wall."
74',action,There’s a delay ahead of the free-kick being taken now as Meunier is down injured.
72',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Steven Moreira. Cavani is brought down by Moreira just outside the box having been played in by Di Maria. The referee shows the right-back a yellow card but that could, and possibly should have been red."
70',action,Unsurprisingly that goal has lifted the crowd significantly and Lorient look full of confidence now. Unai Emery meanwhile looks quite the opposite on the touchline.
68',assist,Assist Sylvain Marveaux. Marveaux has been the best Lorient player on the pitch today and that cross was a superb one for Ciani to attck.
68',goal,"Goal Mickaël Ciani. GOOOAAAALLLL!!! Ciani pulls once back for Lorient!! Marveaux whips in a delightful corner after good work from Aliadiere to win it, and Ciani gets above Marquinhos at the near post to head the ball into the far corner and give Lorient a glimmer of hope."
66',action,"There are appeals from the home crowd for a penalty as they feel Kurzawa handled the ball inside the penalty box, but the Lorient players don’t look interested and the referee certainly isn’t."
64',action,"Kurzawa gets forward well down the left once again and forces a corner off Moreira, and the left-back then rises highest to meet Di Maria’s cross from the corner, but can only head straight at Lecomte from seven yards out."
62',action,Meunier repays the favour as he brings down Philippoteaux and gets a talking to from the referee. Lorient then look to work it down the right-hand side but Moukandjo loses possession and PSG have it back once again.
60',action,"Meunier is brought down by Philippoteaux on the right-hand touchline but PSG just roll the ball back towards Silva from the free-kick, which rather epitomises their attitude now, as they look as though they’re pretty content to knock the ball around at the back."
58',substitution,Substitution sub-out Benjamin Jeannot sub-in Jeremie Aliadière . A first change for Lorient now as Jeremie Aliadiere replaces the ineffectual Jeannot.
56',action,"Huge chance for Cavani!! Di Maria floats in a free-kick from 30 yards out and Cavani is completely unmarked in on the edge of the six yard box, but can only head straight into the grateful arms of Lecomte."
54',action,PSG break forward again down the left through Rabiot and Draxler but the former’s ball is too heavy and Ciani is able to shepherd it back to his keeper with ease.
52',assist,Assist Edinson Roberto Cavani Gómez. Cavani rolled a simple ball into Nkunku who had acres of space to shoot.
52',goal,Goal Christopher Nkunku. GOAAAALLLLL!!! Nkunku doubles PSG’s lead! The midfielder is picked out 25 yards out from goal by Cavani and his low shot beats Lecomte to his left and finds the back of the net. That was pretty poor goalkeeping in truth.
50',action,The PSG back four are seeing plenty of the ball at the start of this second half with Rabiot dropping in between the two centre-halves to take possession. Lorient maintain their shape though and eventually Marquinhos launches a long ball forward which is easily caught by Lecomte.
48',action,PSG have started the second half brightly and Peybernes has had to make a couple of crucial interceptions already. You feel a second goal for PSG early in this half would all but kill off this game.
46',action,Kick-off! Lorient get the second half underway.
,action,"Lorient will certainly want to get Sylvain Marveaux on the ball more often in the second half, as he’s look their most dangerous player by far, while Unai Emery will be asking for more of the same from his PSG side, who have been solid if unspectacular."
,action,"PSG lead at the break thanks to Cavani’s clever flick at the near post from Di Maria’s low corner, although it may well go down as a Jeannot own goal. Lorient have equipped themselves well though and have had one great opportunity to score themselves when Marveaux shot straight at Trapp."
,action,Half-time: Lorient 0-1 PSG
45'+1',action,We’re into just one minute of added time.
44',action,"Philippoteaux skips away from Pastore on the left-hand side and fires an ambitious effort towards Trapp’s goal from 25 yards out, but it’s always rising and goes comfortably over the bar."
42',action,"Pastore plays a lovely through ball into the path of Nkunku inside the left-hand edge of the penalty box, but his low cross is well intercepted by Lecomte who hangs on at the near post."
39',action,"PSG having grown in confidence significantly since that goal, and they’re starting to look far more dangerous going forward which will be a concern for Lorient."
37',action,"Another half-chance for PSG as Pastore drives into the Lorient penalty box, but ends up caught in two minds over whether to shoot himself or lay the ball off to Cavani, and in the end he does neither."
35',action,"Pastore looks to play in Cavani but puts too much on the pass and Lecomte comes off his line well, but his clearance is a poor one and goes straight to Nkunku, but fortunately for the Lorient keeper the midfielder opts against shooting from range."
33',action,"Di Maria is down receiving some treatment to what looks to be a calf injury, drawing whistles from the home crowd who perhaps feel he’s making the most of it. It looks as though he’s going to be able to continue though."
31',action,"Chance!! A huge chance for Lorient to respond immediately as Philippoteaux rolls the ball into Marveaux who turns brilliantly on the edge of the box, but his toe-poked shot is straight at Trapp from 18 yards out."
28',own-goal,"Own Goal Benjamin Jeannot. GOOAAAALLLLLLL!!! Cavani gives PSG the lead!! Lecomte does superbly well to keep out Cavani’s one-one-one effort, but from the resultant corner the striker gets to the ball ahead of Peybernes at the near post and flicks the ball in from a tight angle."
27',action,"Meunier gives the ball away cheaply on the edge of the Lorient penalty box and Lorient break forwards in numbers through Philippoteaux, but the attack breaks down as PSG get back in numbers."
25',action,"Save! Super save from Lecomte as Pastore lifts the ball into the area and Silva leaps high to head it back across the face of goal where Kurzawa is waiting, but the Lorient goalkeeper does superbly well to stick out his left hand and knock it away."
24',action,PSG get a free-kick on the left-hand side of the Lorient penalty box after a foul on Nkunku by Peybernes. Di Maria swings in the cross but Peybernes makes up for conceding the foul with a good clearing header at the near post.
22',action,Di Maria very nearly gets in behind Vincent Le Goff but he can’t bring the high ball under control. Things just aren’t quite clicking for PSG.
20',action,"Unai Emery is patrolling the edge of his technical area shouting instructions at his players as Di Maria fires a ball towards Layvin Kurzawa on the edge of the box, but there’s too much pace on the ball and it goes out for a goal kick."
18',action,"Di Maria plays the ball into the path of Draxler who looks to be away down the left-hand side of the penalty box, but he just delays his shot and Moreira gets back extremely well to force the winger out wide and prevent him getting a shot away."
16',action,"Disallowed goal! Pastore lifts the ball into Cavani inside the box with a lovely chip, and the striker rolls the ball across to Julien Draxler who puts it into an empty net but the flag goes up against Cavani and the goal will not count."
14',action,"Steven Moreira steals the ball away from Pastore just inside the PSG half and feeds the ball into the path of Benjamin Moukandjo on the right-hand side, but his cross is just too high for Jeannot in the middle."
12',action,Mathieu Peybernes is penalised for a late tackle on Adrien Rabiot close to halfway but the referee decides a free-kick is sufficient and doesn’t show the centre-back a card. Lorient are certainly getting stuck in and not giving PSG too much time on the ball in midfield.
10',action,"Thiago Silva lifts the ball into a dangerous area from the left-hand corner of the box, but the flag goes up for offside as Thomas Meunier arrives at the back post and blasts the ball just over the bar."
8',action,PSG are just starting to see a bit more of the ball now but Lorient look extremely well organised at the moment and PSG are struggling to create anything significant.
6',action,Close! Marquinhos’s clearance goes straight to Alhassan Wakaso who strikes it towards goal from 30 yards out and it goes narrowly wide of Kevin Trapp’s goal via a deflection. Trapp though does well to come off his line and claim the resultant corner high above his head.
5',action,"Sylvain Marveaux picks out Benjamin Jeannot with a crisp ball down the right-hand touchline, but Marquinhos gets across well to make the tackle and cut out the danger. Lorient will be relatively pleased with their start here though."
4',action,Cavani strikes it but goes for power over precision and fires it well over the bar. It was perhaps just a little too close to goal to get the free-kick up and over the wall.
3',action,PSG win an early free-kick right on the edge of the Lorient penalty box as Michael Ciani brings down Christopher Nkunku and PSG have am early chance to test Benjamin Lecomte in the Lorient goal.
1',action,Kick-off! Edinson Cavani gets the game underway for PSG.
,action,"The players are making their way out onto the pitch, led by referee Tony Chapron. Kick-off is not far away now."
,action,"The two sides met at the Parc de Princes in December when PSG cruised to a 5-0 win, with four different PSG players getting on the scoresheet alongside a Zargo Toure own goal."
,action,"There are three changes to the PSG side that was humiliated by Barcelona, as Christopher Nkunku, Javier Pastore and Angel Di Maria replace Lucas Moura, Marco Verratti and Blaise Matuidi."
,action,"Bernard Casoni makes five changes to the Lorient side that was beaten by Marseille, with Steven Moreira, Michael Ciani, Arnold Mvuemba, Benjamin Moukandjo and Romain Philippoteaux all coming into the side. Erwin Koffi, Zargo Toure, Matteo Guendouzi, Jeremie Aliadiere and Majeed Waris are the men who make way."
,action,"Subs: Areola, Aurier, Kimpembe, Maxwell, Krychowiak, Ben Arfa, Guedes"
,action,"PSG (4-3-3): Trapp; Meunier, Marquinhos, Thiago Silva, Kurzawa; Nkunku, Rabiot, Pastore; Di Maria, Cavani, Draxler"

,action,"Team news: Lorient (4-3-3): Lecomte; Moreira, Ciani, Peybernes, Le Goff; Mvuemba, Wakaso, Marveaux; Moukandjo, Jeannot, Philippoteaux"
,action,"Despite that defeat, Unai Emery has been given the full support of the club’s president, however another defeat today would certainly increase the pressure on the PSG boss with his side six points behind leaders Monaco already."
,action,"PSG meanwhile are third in the table behind Monaco and Nice, however they will still be reeling from their Champions League exit in midweek, when they were on the wrong end of an astonishing comeback from Barcelona, going out 6-5 on aggregate despite being 5-3 up in the closing stages."
,action,"Their most recent loss was a 4-1 home defeat to fifth placed Marseille, with Benjamin Moukandjo’s second half goal a mere consolation for Bernard Casoni’s side."
,action,"Lorient are in a dreadful run of form having won just once in their last eight league fixtures, and currently sit bottom of the Ligue 1 table, six points adrift of safety."
