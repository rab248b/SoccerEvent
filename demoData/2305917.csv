,action,"It was a frustrating and difficult afternoon for Milan, who, in the end, didn't quite have enough to break down a hard-working Atalanta side. Gian Piero Gasperini's men were on the front foot in the first half but dropped off in the second, resulting in them spending most of the second period on the back foot. The hosts threw everything they had at their opponents thanks to good performances from Lapadula and, in particular, Bonaventura, but it wasn't to be enough."
,action,FULL-TIME: MILAN 0-0 ATALANTA
90'+4',yellow-card,Yellow Card Marco Sportiello. Sportiello unsurprisingly ends up taking his time with the resulting free-kick and ends up receiving a yellow card for time-wasting. I don't think he'll be too worried about that.
90'+3',action,"Niang desperately tries to break into the Atalanta penalty area on what could prove to be one of the home side's final chances of the game, but he loses out to Gagliardini and then ends up dragging the midfielder to the ground as they battle for the ball."
90'+2',action,"Poor touch by Freuler! Suso's eventual cross fails to find a Milan player and allows Atalanta to hit the home side on a great counter-attack, but the Swiss midfielder is unable to get the ball under control and loses out on the edge of the box. He really should have done better with that!"
90'+1',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Alejandro Darío Gómez. Again, a hefty challenge results in a free-kick over on the left wing. Suso tries to whip it into the penalty area, but Gomez cheekily creeps forward and stops the Spaniard from doing so before receiving a yellow card."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be four minutes of added time.
89',action,"It's all Milan at the moment as they desperately try to find a way through Atalanta's determined back line, but, no matter what they try to do, they can't seem to get the better of the visitors. Atalanta have done well to hold on and will be very pleased with a point if the game ends that way."
87',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Giacomo Bonaventura sub-in M'Baye Babacar Niang . Milan have made another attacking substitution, with Bonaventura making way for M'Baye Niang."
86',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Andrea Petagna. Petagna, who has had few chances to push forward and looks frustrated about it, clashes with Romagnoli as he tries to latch on to a loose ball and ends up receiving a late yellow card as a result."
85',action,"Almost a stunning introduction for Bacca! The Colombian makes a great run into the right-hand side of the Atalanta penalty area and rounds Sportiello before shooting, but Conti is there to stop the striker's effort at the near post."
83',action,"Great effort by Toloi! The centre-back finds himself in unfamiliar territory after breaking forward on a great run to latch on to a swinging cross from Gomez, but his looping header is tipped over the top of the crossbar by Donnarumma."
82',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Gianluca Lapadula sub-in Carlos Arturo Bacca Ahumada . Milan have made a late change, with Carlos Bacca coming on to take the place of Lapadula."
81',action,"After dealing with the danger, Kessie charges forward on a dangerous counter-attack before doing well to win his side a corner. It's curled into the heart of the penalty area and almost finds a white shirt, but Abate is there to make sure that it doesn't."
80',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Andrea Conti. Conti and Bonaventura clash over on the left flank, resulting in a free-kick for Milan and a yellow card for the Atalanta defender. It's sent short to Suso, who then curls a cross into the middle of the box, but Drame is easily able to head the Spaniard's pass away from goal."
78',action,"And now Kucka goes close! Milan pile bodies forward as they desperately try to find an opener. This time it's Kucka who skips into a great position before unleashing a great strike, but, from a tight angle, it ends up fizzing across the face of goal."
77',action,"Off the line! A Milan free-kick isn't dealt with well by Sportiello, who fumbles the ball down to Romagnoli. The defender then pokes it over to Lapadula, but the striker's poked effort from close range fails to beat the wall of white shirts on the goal line."
76',action,"Milan quickly come back once again and burst forward through Lapadula, who then tries to tee up Bonaventura, but the striker's chipped pass is read well by Toloi and the defender is able to nod the ball out for another corner."
75',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Mario Pašalić. The resulting corner is whipped into the heart of the penalty area and finds Pasalic in a great position, but the midfielder's attempted overhead kick sees him catch Drame in the head and results in a yellow card for the Croatian."
74',action,"Vital interception by Conti! Kucka charges into the right-hand side of the Atalanta box and heads towards the byline before trying to pick out Bonaventura with a chipped cross, but Conti is just about able to beat the midfielder to the ball to stop him from nodding the ball into the back of the net from a few yards out."
72',action,"Gomez, who has been unable to see as much of the ball in the second half as he did before the break, cuts inside from the left wing on a great run before trying to test Donnarumma from 25 yards out. His fierce strike is slightly mishit, however, and ends up flying several yards wide of the far post."
71',substitution,Substitution sub-out Luca Antonelli sub-in Mattia De Sciglio . Substitution  sub-out Luca Antonelli sub-in Mattia De Sciglio
70',action,"Gagliardini is caught from behind by Kucka and Atalanta win themselves a free-kick midway down the left flank. A dangerous cross is curled into the middle of the Milan box and finds Mattia Caldara in front of goal, but as soon as the defender's header is well saved by Donnarumma, the referee awards the home side a free-kick for a foul on Romagnoli."
69',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Leonardo Spinazzola sub-in Remo Freuler . With 20 minutes left to play, Atalanta have already made their last roll of the dice, with Spinazzola making way for sub-in Remo Freuler."
68',action,"Atalanta are starting to get back into the game as they push further up the pitch, but Milan have certainly been the better of the two sides since the break. They're breaking forward with far more purpose, with Kucka and, in particular, Bonaventura looking a lot more dangerous with the ball at their feet."
66',action,"After spending most of the second half on the back foot, Atalanta are finally able to push forward. They're unable to make it count, however, and Milan hit the visitors on a quick counter-attack of their own. Suso and Lapadula link up well before the ball is sent over to Antonelli, but the left-back's cross into the box can only find the ehad of Zukanovic."
64',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Jasmin Kurtič sub-in Boukary Dramé . Atalanta have made their second alteration, with Boukary Drame coming on to replace Kurtic."
64',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Andrea Bertolacci. Big call by the referee! Lapadula wins the ball back for Milan and quickly tees up Bertolacci, who then flies forward on a determined run. He charges towards the penalty area before being bundled over by Kurtic just outside of the box, but, somehow, the referee gives the free-kick the other way. The Milan midfielder is unsurprisingly incensed at the decision and receives a yellow card for dissent as a result."
62',action,"What a chance for Milan! Kucka brings the ball down beautifully on the right-hand side of the Atalanta box before fizzing a dangerous pass across the face of goal, but neither Lapadula nor Bonaventura are able to reach the ball, despite their best efforts."
60',action,"Zukanovic is almost immediately called into action as Antonelli charges into the Atalanta penalty area and tries to link up with Lapadula, but the defender is just about able to poke the ball away from the striker before he can spin and shoot."
59',action,"Suso skips inside from the right wing before curling a dangerous cross towards Lapadula, who is in a great position in front of goal. The striker rises high and takes on Sportiello, but the goalkeeper is just about able to get a hand to the ball before being fouled by the Milan man."
58',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Andrea Masiello sub-in Ervin Zukanović . Atalanta have made their first substitution of the game, with Masiello, who still seems to be struggling after picking up a slight injury towards the end of the first half, making way for Ervin Zukanovic."
57',action,"Milan are starting to find far more space in the middle of the pitch, and they're using it well. This it's Kucka who charges forward before testing Sportiello from 25 yards out, but his thumping strike loops a few yards over the top of the crossbar."
56',action,"Just wide from Bonaventura! The midfielder once again causes Atalanta problems with his movement before shooting from 25 yards out, and this time his low effort ends up going much nearer to opening the scoring for Milan. That's more like it from the hosts!"
55',action,"Abate darts down the right wing on a great run before firing a cross into the box that Masiello is just about able to deal with at the near post. Spinazzola then nods the ball out for a corner, but Milan are unable to take advantage of the set-piece and fail to carve out a chance on goal."
54',action,"Golden opportunity for Bonaventura! The midfielder twists and turns beautifully on the edge of the Atalanta penalty area as he skips past his marker and shoots, but there's far too much power behind his effort and it ends up sailing a few yards over the top of the crossbar."
52',action,"Kessie picks up possession on the halfway line and breaks down the right wing on a strong run. The ball is then quickly worked over to Kurtic, who swiftly unleashes a curling strike from the edge of the penalty area, but the shot flies straight to Donnarumma in the middle of the goal."
50',action,"Antonelli is fouled midway down the left wing and Milan win themselves a free-kick in a good position. It's sent short and worked over to Suso on the opposite flank, but the Spaniard's cross-cum-shot ends up bouncing straight into the hands of Sportiello."
48',action,"Atalanta quickly come back once again, with Gomez pushing forward on another good run. He darts down the left wing before going down under a challenge from Paletta, but the referee correcntly waves play on, with the replays showing that no contact was made."
47',action,"Almost a dramatic start to the second half! Andrea Bertolacci loses out in the middle of the pitch and allows Gomez to break into the Milan box and shoot, but he's unable to beat Donnarumma from a tight angle and the home side are just about able to hold on."
46',action,And we're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"Antonelli's thumping shot late on was Milan's first real chance on goal, as it's been a bit of a tough afternoon for them thus far. They've largely been second best to Atalanta, who have continually put them under pressure and caused problems in the middle of the pitch. Gomez and Petagna have also started to find more joy in advanced areas, resulting in the home side's back line almost always having plenty to deal with."
,action,HALF-TIME: MILAN 0-0 ATALANTA
45'+2',action,"Antonelli hits the post! Milan immediately fly forward on an excellent counter-attack as Antontelli darts down the left wing on a brilliant run. He skips past Conti and into the penalty area before shooting, but his rocket of a strike ricochets off the woodwork after leaving Sportiello rooted to the spot."
45'+1',action,"Atalanta almost make it 1-0! Spinazzola causes Abate yet more problems before being brought down from behind by the Milan defender, resulting in another free-kick for the visitors. Gomez steps up and curls a gorgeous cross into the middle of the box, but Gagliardini's close-range header is just about dealt with by Donnarumma, despite the youngster spilling the effort on goal."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be just one minute of added time.
44',action,"What a chance for Conti! Spinazzola beats both Abate and Kucka over on the left flank before curling a wonderful cross into the heart of the penalty area. Conti rises high and does well to beat Antonelli to the ball, but he's unable to test Donnarumma with his looping header."
42',action,"A high foot from Kucka isn't appreciated by the referee and results in another free-kick for Atalanta. This time Gomez tries to pick out a white shirt with a chip towards the far post, but Romagnoli reads the danger well to cut it out at the vital moment."
41',action,"Almost a chance for Gagliardini! Atalanta keep putting pressure on Milan before Petagna flicks a lovely pass towards Gagliardini, who is in a great position on the edge of the six-yard box. The midfielder tries to latch on to the pass but is out-muscled at the last moment, allowing Milan to just about hold on once again."
39',action,"Atalanta push plenty of bodies forward before winning themselves a free-kick midway inside the Milan half of the pitch. Gomez decides to play the ball short instead of whipping it into the box, but it proves to be the wrong choice as it's easily snuffed out by the home side."
37',action,"Suso steps up and tries to pick out a teammate at the far post, but his attempted cross into the Atalanta penalty area is completely overhit and ends up sailing harmlessly out for a goal-kick."

35',action,"After spending a few minutes on the back foot, Milan are able to push forward again. They're fail to take advantage of the opportunity, however, as a poor pass from Kucka is easily cut out by Gomez, who then bursts forward on an attacking move of his own."
34',action,"Gomez, who has arguably been one of Atalanta's most dangerous players thus far, cuts inside from the left wing on a good run before trying to pick out a teammate inside the penalty area, but he holds on to the ball for far too long and allows Ignazio Abate to dart back and deal with him."
32',action,"And now Roberto Gagliardini goes close! A dangerous lofted pass flies over the top of the Milan back line and towards Petagna, who brings down the ball well inside the hosts' box. He then spins and finds Gagliardini, but the midfielder is closed down quickly and is unable to shoot, despite his best efforts."
30',action,"What an opportunity for Petagna! Atalanta come back once again, this time through Spinazzola down the right flank. The wing-back cuts inside and sets up Petagna, who then somehow manages to muscle his way past three players before shooting. His shot isn't hit at all well enough though, and Donnarumma is able to watch the close-range effort sail wide of the near post."
28',action,"Kucka commits a poor foul on the halfway line and gifts Atalanta the chance to push forward. They do so patiently before Gomez rushes down the left wing, but he loses out to Paletta as he tries to skip past the centre-back."
26',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Giacomo Bonaventura. Milan go close! Another Milan free-kick causes problems for Atalanta after being played short. It's knocked down to Antonelli, who then fires a dangerous cross into the middle of the box that Sportiello is just about able to palm away from Lapadula. The ball is then picked up by Gomez, and the Argentine is quickly fouled by a clumsy challenge from Bonaventura."
25',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Leonardo Spinazzola. Milan quickly try to embark on a swift counter-attack through Suso, who flies through the middle of the pitch on a great run before being cynically challenged by Leonardo Spinazzola just as he's about to beat the wing-back."
24',action,"Atalanta come out on top after the two sides battle fiercely in the middle of the pitch. Kurtic is finally able to skip away from his marker before linking up with Petagna on the edge of the Milan box, but Gabriel Paletta immediately deals with the striker with a great tackle from behind."
22',action,"Alejandro Gomez goes close! The Argentine links up brilliantly with Petagna on the edge of the Milan penalty area before unleashing a shot at the near post, but he's unable to hit the target from a very tight angle and ends up sending the ball fizzing across the face of the goal."
20',action,"After dealing with the danger, Atalanta try to hit Milan on a quick counter-attack. Petagna charges forward on a good run down the right wing before cutting inside and taking on Alessio Romagnoli, but the centre-back stands tall and does well to steal the ball from the striker."
19',action,"Bonaventura twists and turns as he weaves his way towards the Atalanta penalty area on a great run, but just as it looks as if he's about to penetrate the box, Kessie dispossesses the Milan midfielder with a hefty but fair tackle."
17',action,"Toloi and Kurtic almost link up well deep down the right wing after good build-up play from the visitors, but Bonaventura slides in front of the Slovenian and does well to dispossess him before he's able to whip a cross into the Milan box."
15',action,"Lapadula charges through Atalanta's high line as he tries to latch on to a lofted pass forward, but his run into the penalty area is slightly mistimed and the linesman's flag is raised as soon as he reaches the ball in a promising position."
14',action,"Yet another clumsy challenge gives Milan the opportunity to whip a cross into the penalty area, but they instead play the ball short to Antonelli and win themselves a corner after almost taking Atalanta by surprise. Suso steps up and curls a cross towards the near post, but, once again, he's unable to pick out a teammate in front of goal."
12',action,"Another poor foul brings an end to a promising Milan attack, and once again it's Bonaventura who is brought down over on the left wing. The cross into the middle of the penalty area is a much better one, but Atalanta do well to deal with the danger."

10',action,"Atalanta move the ball around nicely before Rafael Toloi slips a clever pass towards Andrea Conti. The wing-back darts into the right-hand side of the penalty area and tries to dart in front of Antonelli, but he ends up fouling the Milan defender and gives away a free-kick."

6',action,"Almost an opportunity for Gianluca Lapadula! The striker bursts through the Atalanta back line and heads into the box before trying to take on Marco Sportiello, but Franck Kessie does well to dart back to deal with the Milan man before he can shoot."
4',action,"Chance for Andrea Patagna! The throw-in is quickly sent to Patagna, who then cuts inside from the right wing.

They have also managed to pick up a draw and a win from their last two visits to San Siro to take on Milan, leaving this afternoon’s hosts with just one win from the previous five meetings."
,action,"As for Atalanta, a wonderful 10-game unbeaten run saw them fly up the table, but Juventus brought them crashing back down to earth before Udinese became the first side since Palermo back in September to leave the Stadio Atleti Azzurri d’Italia with a win. The club from Bergamo haven’t lost three consecutive league games since January, and another defeat here today could result in them dropping as low as eighth if other results don’t go their way."
,action,"The defeat against Roma was Milan’s first since October, but it means that they now sit three points behind the club from the capital in third place. They will be looking for a win today to not only help keep alive their slim title chances but also to keep at bay Napoli and Lazio, both of whom lie just one point behind."
,action,"This afternoon’s clash brings together two sides that will be desperately aiming to bounce back from frustrating defeats in an attempt to keep the pressure on Roma, who, at this stage of the season, look the most likely to challenge Juventus for the title. The Giallorossi were victorious against Milan on Monday evening, whilst Atalanta were beaten 3-1 by 13th-place Udinese."
