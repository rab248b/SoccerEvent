,action,"What a win for Liverpool! The home fans go wild as the referee blows his whistle for the final time, and it's no wonder why. They were given a bit of a scare by Arsenal in the second half but, overall, were excellent throughout as they showed what they're capable of after a poor display against Leicester on Monday evening. As for Arsenal, the defeat is a big blow to their hopes of finishing in the top four, and their abject first-half performance will be a real cause for concern."
,action,FULL-TIME: LIVERPOOL 3-1 ARSENAL
90'+4',action,"Arsenal desperately try to push forward on one last attacking move, but they're unable to carve out a chance on goal. A thumping pass is then fired up the pitch and towards the visitors' penalty area, but, despite his best efforts, Trent Alexander-Arnold is unable to meet the ball and loses out to Cech."
90'+3',substitution,Substitution sub-out Sadio Mané sub-in Trent Arnold . And now Trent Alexander-Arnold comes on to replace Mane as Liverpool try to run down the clock.
90'+2',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Adam Lallana sub-in Lucas Pezzini-Leiva . Liverpool have made a late, defensive change, with sub-out Adam Lallana making way for Lucas Leiva."
90'+1',goal,"Goal Georginio Wijnaldum. GOAL! Wijnaldum has wrapped up the win! An Arsenal attack breaks down and Liverpool quickly hit the visitors on a wonderful break. Lallana charges through the middle of the pitch before teeing up Origi over on the right flank, and the Belgian then tees up Wijnaldum with a lovely low cross that the Dutchman immediately slots past Cech and into the bottom right-hand corner of the net."
90'+1',assist,Assist Divock Okoth Origi. Assist Divock Okoth Origi
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be three minutes of added time.
88',action,"Walcott charges forward before teeing up Bellerin over on the right flank. The Spaniard is quickly closed down by Klavan, however, and loses out to the Estonian before clumsily fouling him from behind near to the byline."
86',action,"Both sides are really going for it at the moment, as both can clearly sense an opportunity to score a late goal. Arsenal have increased the tempo of their attacking moves and are doing well to put the Liverpool defence under some late pressure."
84',action,"Almost a chance for Perez! A dangerous cross is fired into the Liverpool penalty area and almost finds the Spaniard in front of goal, but it bounces off the back of Lallana before it can reach him and then bounces out of play."
82',action,"Origi hits the post! Mustafi and Origi tangle over on the left wing, resulting in a free-kick for Liverpool. It's swung into the box and finds the head of Origi, but he sees his downward header crash off the post after beating the outstretched limbs of Cech."
80',substitution,Substitution sub-out Philippe Coutinho Correia sub-in Divock Okoth Origi . Coutinho receives a rousing round of applause from the Liverpool fans as he makes way for Divock Origi.
79',action,"The resulting free-kick is swung into the heart of the Arsenal penalty area and finds the head of Mustafi, but the centre-back is unable to guide his headed effort towards goal and sends it looping over the top of the crossbar."
78',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Granit Xhaka. There's a coming together in the middle of the pitch that leaves Can in a heap on the floor and in serious discomfort after his crunching sliding tackle goes wrong, but it's Xhaka who receives a yellow card for trying to get the German booked."
76',action,"Matip goes close! Liverpool win themselves a corner over on the right wing that Coutinho curls right on to the head of Matip, but the defender is unable to make decent contact with the ball and sends his effort bouncing into the hands of Cech at the near post."
74',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Olivier Giroud sub-in Lucas Pérez Martínez . And the second is Lucas Perez, who replaces Giroud up front."
74',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Daniel Nii Tackie Mensah Welbeck sub-in Theo Walcott . Arsenal have made a double change as they desperately try to find an equaliser. The first player to come on is sub-in Theo Walcott, who takes the place of Welbeck."
73',action,"Chance for Coutinho! The Brazilian twists and turns just outside of the Arsenal penalty area before finally managing to get a shot away, but there's slightly too much power behind it and it sails a few yards over the top of the crossbar."
72',action,"Another attempted Liverpool attack comes to an end and gifts Arsenal with an opportunity to counter quickly, but, despite his best efforts, Sanchez is unable to make his way past the halfway line and is dispossessed by Koscielny at the vital moment."
70',action,"Firmino dances his way into the left-hand side of the Arsenal penalty area on a great run as he brushes off several tackles. He then tries to tee up Mane, but he's unable to get the ball to reach the Senegalese midfielder and Arsenal just about hold on."
68',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Emre Can. Can cynically blocked Sanchez in the build-up to Arsenal's last attacking move, and he becomes the latest player to enter the referee's book as a result."
67',action,"Another attempted Liverpool attack breaks down, allowing Arsenal to hit them on a quick counter. Sanchez flies through the middle of the pitch before teeing up Welbeck, who then fires the ball over to Bellerin, but the Spaniard's low cross into the box is poor and fails to find a way past Klavan."
65',action,"Liverpool work the ball around really nicely as they try to carve open the Arsenal back line with a quick attacking move, but it's brought to an end by a disappointing shot from Clyne that sails comfortably over the top of the crossbar."
63',action,"Bellerin breaks into the right-hand side of the Liverpool box on a wonderful run as he heads towards the byline. He spots a run from Sanchez into the penalty area and quickly tries to set up the Chilean, but Clyne is there to make sure that the attacking midfielder can't reach the ball."
62',action,"Firmino and Milner try to play a quick one-two between themselves as they attempt to find a way down the left wing, but, once again, Mustafi is there to deal with the danger with a well-timed sliding tackle."
60',action,"Vital interception by Mustafi! Mane and Coutinho link up really well once again before the Brazilian fizzes a dangerous pass across the face of goal, but Mustafi is just about able to stick out a foot to stop it from reaching a red shirt."
59',action,"Arsenal immediately win the ball back from the restart and push forward once again, but they're unable to carve out a chance on goal and a cross from the left flank is instead curled straight into the hands of Mignolet."
57',assist,"Assist Alexis Alejandro Sánchez Sánchez. Sanchez has made a big impact after coming off the substitutes' bench, and it was his pace and trickery that helped set up Welbeck to get Arsenal back into the game."
57',goal,"Goal Daniel Nii Tackie Mensah Welbeck. GOAL! Arsenal have pulled one back! After dealing with the danger at one end, the visitors fly forward at the other. Sanchez sprints through the middle of the pitch and towards the penalty area before teeing up Welbeck with a delightful through-ball, and the forward then chips a lovely shot over Mignolet and into the back of the net."
56',action,"Xhaka is caught in possession by Coutinho over on the right flank, allowing Liverpool to push forward once again. The Brazilian cuts inside from the wing and then tees up Firmino, but the latter is unable to find a way past Bellerin and is out-muscled by the right-back."
54',action,"Coutinho steps up and shoots from the free-kick, but it fails to find its way through the wall of yellow camped just inside the penalty area. The ball then bounces out to Wijnaldum, but the Dutchman's follow-up lacks the power needed to trouble Cech."
53',action,"Coutinho weaves his way towards the Arsenal box on a wonderful run before being hauled down by Monreal, and now it's Liverpool who have been presented with a free-kick in an incredibly dangerous position. Can they make it count?"
52',action,"Iwobi is tripped over by Can as he cuts inside from the right wing, resulting in a free-kick for Arsenal in a promising position. It's chipped in by Xhaka and almost finds Giroud, but the Frenchman is unable to make decent contact with the ball in front of goal before being flagged offside."
51',action,"Firmino spins round Koscielny with ease after latching on to a chipped pass into the Arsenal penalty area from Mane, but the Brazilian is unable to wrap up a great move by beating Cech and instead fires his close-range shot straight into the hands of the goalkeeper."
49',action,"Wonderful save by Mignolet! Arsenal come back once again, this time through Monreal. The full-back gets himself into a pocket of space over on the left wing before swinging a cross right on to the head of Giroud, but the striker's bullet header is somehow clawed away by an acrobatic stop from Mignolet."
47',action,"Sanchez makes an immediate impact as he skips down the left flank and curls a dangerous cross into the heart of the Liverpool penalty area, where Mignolet is just about to get a hand to the ball to push it away from Iwobi's head."
46',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Francis Coquelin sub-in Alexis Alejandro Sánchez Sánchez . Arsenal have made a substitution during the half-time, with Alexis Sanchez unsurprisingly coming on to take the place of Coquelin."
46',action,We're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half.
,action,"It's been a near-perfect first half for Liverpool, who head down the tunnel with a well-deserved two-goal lead against a very lacklustre Arsenal side. The visitors have created very little going forward, leaving the Liverpool back line with almost nothing to do so far. At the other end, meanwhile, the Reds' front line has been on fire, with Coutinho, Firmino and, in particular, Mane all causing plenty of problems in front of goal."
,action,HALF-TIME: LIVERPOOL 2-0 ARSENAL
45'+1',action,"Coutinho causes plenty of problems for the Arsenal defence as he twists and turns on the edge of the penalty area, but he's unable to hit the target with his shot and isnread sends it off an outstretched foot and wide of the near post."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be two minutes of added time.
44',action,"What a chance for Coutinho to make it 3-0! Lallana charges into the Arsenal half of the pitch before lifting a deflected pass over the head of Mustafi and on to the foot of Coutinho. The Brazilian takes a quick touch before shooting from close range, but it's well smothered by Cech in the middle of the goal."
42',action,"Liverpool break forward on yet another attacking move as they try to pile further misery on a struggling Arsenal back line, but Lallana's pass into the penalty area and towards Coutinho is slightly overhit and is shepherded out of play by Koscielny."
40',assist,"Assist Roberto Firmino Barbosa de Oliveira. Firmino did well to spin round Xhaka before picking out Mane, but, once again, Arsenal were caught all over the place at the back, with the Senegalese midfielder being left in far too much space over on the right-hand side of the box."
40',goal,"Goal Sadio Mané. GOAL! It's 2-0! Liverpool move the ball around wonderfully as they quickly run rings around Arsenal over on the left wing. It's worked into the penalty area and over to Firmino, who swiftly picks out Mane to fire a great strike past Cech and into the bottom left-hand corner of the net."
38',action,"Oxlade-Chamberlain, who has struggled to get into the game inside the Liverpool half of the pitch, has a chance to break down the right wing on a marauding run, but he's quickly put under pressure by Can and loses out to the German before he can do anything with the ball."
36',action,"Mane picks up the ball in a promising position on the edge of the Arsenal penalty area and spins quickly before unleashing a cross-cum-shot towards the far post, but, off balance, he's unable to find a team-mate or the back of the net and instead sends the ball sailing comfortably wide of the goal."
35',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Francis Coquelin. Coquelin loses out to Lallana in the middle of the pitch before cynically dragging the midfielder back, resulting in him receiving a yellow card."
34',action,"Coutinho flies towards the Arsenal penalty area before going down under a challenge from Coquelin, but the referee immediately signals to play on, despite a few half-hearted pleas from the Liverpool players for a free-kick."
32',action,"Mane spins round Monreal on the edge of the Arsenal penalty area before trying to tee up Wijnaldum with a poked pass, but it's overhit by the attacking midfielder and is just about dealt with by the visitors."
30',action,"A hopeful ball forward finds Giroud on the edge of the Liverpool box, and the Frenchman does well to rise high above his marker before nodding the ball down to Xhaka. The midfielder then unleashes a first-time strike from 25 yards out, but it's far too powerful and fails to hit the target."
29',action,"The corner fails to result in a chance on goal before Milner slots a lovely pass through to Can at the near post, but the German accidentally catches Coquelin from behind and concedes a free-kick."
28',action,"Thumping strike by Coutinho! A sloppy pass by Monreal can only find Georginio Wijnaldum, who then tees up Coutinho. The Brazilian is in a pocket of space on the edge of the penalty area and immediately unleashes a rocket of a shot, but Cech is there to parry it away from goal with a diving save."
26',action,"Firmino brings down a lofted pass forward on the right-hand side of the Arsenal penalty area before teeing up Mane to his side, but, after initially doing well to skip past Monreal, the Senegalese midfielder runs the ball out play with a heavy final touch."
24',action,"Almost an opportunity for Firmino! Arsenal are caught out at the back once again as Mane pokes a delightful pass through to Firmino, but the Brazilian's run through the visitors' back line is slightly mistimed and he's flagged offside just as he's about to penetrate the penalty area."
23',action,"Arsenal continue to enjoy a good spell of possession as they attempt to find a way through the sea of red shirts camped in front of them, but a poor first touch from Iwobi brings the attacking move to an end just outside of the penalty area."
21',action,"Xhaka's cross from the corner is poor and can only find Milner, but he's presented with another chance to whip a cross into the penalty area. His second ball into the box is just as ineffective, however, and this time it's Matip who's there to deal with it."
20',action,"Firmino has the ball poked away from his feet by Alex Iwobi, who then sets up Oxlade-Chamberlain over on the right wing. He cuts inside and beats his marker before chipping a cross over to Giroud at the back post, but Simone Mignolet gets the faintest of touches on the ball to send it away from the Frenchman and out for a corner."
18',action,"It's all Liverpool at the moment as they continue to put the visitors' back line under plenty of pressure. They're pressing with an intensity that was missing in Monday's defeat away to Leicester, whilst they've been pushing forward with the needed urgency to frustrate the Arsenal defence."
16',action,"Philippe Coutinho steps up and curls a cross right on to the head of Ragnar Klavan, but the centre-back is unable to control the ball. It comes back to the Brazilian, however, and his low pass across the face of goal almost finds the outstretched foot of Matip on the penalty spot."
15',action,"Arsenal are caught sleeping in the middle of the pitch, allowing Adam Lallana to pick up the ball in a promising position. Emre Can then blasts a great lofted pass over to Clyne on the right flank, and the full-back does well to fire a cross off Monreal and out for a corner."
13',action,"Another long ball over the top of the Arsenal defence almost causes further problems for the visitors, but Mane is slightly heavy-handed in his handling of Shkodran Mustafi results in a free-kick for the Gunners just as the Senegalese midfielder is about to dart into the penalty area."
11',action,"Arsenal push forward from the restart as they try to find a way back into the game, but a hopeful long pass forward from Laurent Koscielny fails to find Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain over on the right wing and is easily dealt with by Coutinho."
9',assist,"Assist Sadio Mané. That was great play by Mane, who looked as if he was going to shoot only to pick out Firmino unmarked in front of goal, but Arsenal were left exposed inside their own penalty area and should have done much better."
9',goal,"Goal Roberto Firmino Barbosa de Oliveira. GOAL! Liverpool take the lead! Arsenal are caught at sixes and sevens at the back as Liverpool break forward quickly. Mane picks up the ball on the right-hand side of the box and immediately fires a low cross over to the back post, where Firmino takes a quick touch before blasting the ball past Petr Cech."
8',action,"Arsenal patiently pass the ball around midway inside the Liverpool half of the pitch before Xhaka chips a pass down the left flank and into the path of Monreal. It's slightly overhit, however, and narrowly misses the outstretched foot of the Spaniard."
6',action,"Nacho Monreal is put under pressure by Nathaniel Clyne and concedes a throw-in deep inside the Arsenal half of the pitch. It's sent short and eventually worked over to Coutinho, but the Brazilian's lofted, cross-field pass over towards Sadio Mane is completely overhit and sails out for a goal-kick."
5',action,"Hector Bellerin gets himself into a pocket of space deep down the right wing before chipping a dangerous cross over to Olivier Giroud at the far post, but Joel Matip rises high above the Frenchman to nod the ball behind for a corner. Granti Xhaka's cross from the set-piece is just as dangerous as Bellerin's, but Matip is there once again."
3',action,"Philippe Coutinho threads an impressive through-ball into the Arsenal penalty area and towards Roberto Firmino, who then spins and tees up James Milner. The full-back then tries to whip a cross into the box but is unable to do so and has to settle for a corner, which fails to result in a chance on goal."
1',action,"We're off! Arsenal get us underway, attacking from left to right."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."
,action,"Meanwhile, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has made three alterations to the team that featured in their last league outing, with the main talking point being the dropping of Alexis Sanchez to the substitute’s bench. In his place comes Olivier Giroud, whilst Theo Walcott and Mesut Ozil have also made way for Granit Xhaka and Danny Welbeck."
,action,"Jurgen Klopp has decided to make just one change to the Liverpool side that started the defeat against Leicester on Monday, with Ragnar Klavan coming into the starting line-up to replace Lucas Leiva in the centre of defence."

,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"The loss against the reigning champions means that another defeat today would not only keep Liverpool in fifth place but would also run the risk of leaving them just two points clear of Everton if their local rivals are victorious against Tottenham tomorrow. Liverpool’s current run is the worst they’ve suffered in the league since October 2012, and with games against Manchester City and Everton fast approaching, they can’t afford to slip any further if they’re to have a chance of finishing in the top four."
,action,"As for Liverpool, an impressive 2016 has turned into a miserable 2017 after managing to win just one of their last seven Premier League games. Tottenham were dispatched in excellent fashion three weeks ago, but that impressive victory, which initially seemed to signal a turnaround for the Reds, was followed by an abject and disappointing defeat away to Leicester City on Monday evening."
,action,"A handful of disappointing results - including a defeat at home to Watford and a draw away to Bournemouth - has left Arsenal with just three wins from their previous six league outings, and the gap between themselves and league leaders Chelsea now stands at 13 points. They can move equal on points with rivals Tottenham Hotspur with a win today, however, whilst a victory would also see them climb above Manchester City."
,action,"This afternoon’s clash brings together two sides that are separated by just one point, with both desperately battling for a top-four finish. Southampton’s appearance in the EFL Cup final meant that Arsenal were last in action two weeks ago, and Arsene Wenger will be hoping that the rest handed to his players will give them the edge against an out-of-form Liverpool side."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Premier League game between Liverpool and Arsenal at Anfield.
