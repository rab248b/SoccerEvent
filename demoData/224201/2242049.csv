,action,"Arsenal end a run of back-to-back defeats in the Premier League as a second-half equaliser from Shkodran Mustafi earned the Gunners a point, although it will probably not be enough in their bid to finish in fourth."

53',goal,Goal Shkodran Mustafi. GOALLLLLL!!!!! MUSTAFI EQUALISES! For the second time in the game Arsenal rally from a deficit. Ozil's corner is a good one and Mustafi rises highest in the area to power a header into the ground and it beats the outstretched hand of Caballero to find the net.
