,action,"That's all from us today folks, we hope you enjoyed the game!"
,action,"Despite plenty of chances for both teams, neither side could break the deadlock at the Riverside today, with both goalkeepers pulling off superb saves to keep their sides in it."
,action,FULL-TIME: MIDDLESBROUGH 0-0 EVERTON
90'+3',action,That's the full-time whistle!
90'+2',action,"Everton have a corner, could they steal it late on... No. Funes Mori is beaten to the ball and Boro can clear the ball upfield."
90',action,There will be a minimum of three minutes added time played here. Can either side grab a late goal?
87',action,WHAT A SAVE! Robles produces a terrific save to deny Rudy Gestede! It looked like it was flying in! Gestede met Ramirez's cross and diverted a powerful header towards goal which looked to be going in the top left-hand corner. However Robles produces a phenomenal diving save to claw the ball over the bar. Half the ground thought that was going in!
87',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Ross Barkley sub-in Gareth Barry . Third and final Everton substitution now with sub-out Ross Barkley coming off, to be replaced by sub-in Gareth Barry."
85',yellow-card,Yellow Card Gastón Exequiel Ramírez Pereyra. Gastón Ramírez receives a yellow card for a very poor challenge.
84',action,"Guédioura has a good opportunity from long range, but he fires his shot well over the bar. Not the best of efforts from the new signing."
82',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Álvaro Negredo Sánchez sub-in Rudy Gestede . That was Negredo's last contribution today, he is coming off to be replaced by sub-in Rudy Gestede."
81',action,"CHANCE! Negredo almost gets his head to the ball after the cross into the box by Traore. Robles was able to watch the ball drift narrowly past his post, but any touch by Negredo would surely have seen the ball end up in the back of the net."
80',action,"Ramirez has done well for Middlesbrough since coming onto the pitch, he is drifting into the middle of the pitch from the wing and trying to get on the ball at every opportunity and link up with Negredo."
78',action,"Both teams are struggling to keep possession at the moment, as a result neither side is threatening to score. Everton have had the better chances to get on the board, but have been denied by a number of great saves from Victor Valdes in the Middlesbrough goal."
75',action,As we enter the final 15 minutes of the game it is still goalless here at the Riverside. A victory for Boro here would really help them in their battle to stay in the Premier League.
73',substitution,Substitution sub-out Ademola Lookman sub-in Aaron Lennon . Another Everton substitution as sub-out Ademola Lookman comes off and he is replaced by sub-in Aaron Lennon.
71',action,"This game really could go either way at the moment! Middlesbrough have been the better team but the Toffees are starting to create chances of their own once again. Bernado almost gifted Lukaku another chance with a poor ball to Gibson, Luckily the Boro skipper is on his toes and manages to stop the striker from breaking through on goal."
69',action,"SUPERB SAVE! Lookman isn't picked up in the box after a good ball into his path by Barkley. The youngster then just has Valdes to beat, but once again the Boro keeper makes himself big and pulls off a great save! Lukaku was screaming for the ball to be pulled back into his path, but Lookman tried to put the ball into the back of the net himself, only to be denied by a stunning stop."
68',action,"The first thing Ramirez does is give away a free-kick in a good position! Bringing down Lookman with a late challenge. Barkley takes the free-kick and goes for goal, but he fires it straight at Guédioura. Poor set piece."
67',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Cristhian Ricardo Stuani Curbelo sub-in Gastón Exequiel Ramírez Pereyra . Second Middlesbrough substitution with Cristhian Stuani the man heading off the pitch, to be replaced by Gastón Ramírez."
65',action,"OFF THE LINE! Gibson met the corner with a superb header, which looks to be heading into the top corner of the goal. However Baines does his job on the post and heads the ball off the line and then Everton manage to clear the ball."
64',action,Baines makes a foul throw and Boro counter! Chambers with the long throw which is received by Stuani who wins another corner for the hosts.
62',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Idrissa Gana Gueye sub-in Enner Remberto Valencia Lastra . Ronald Koeman doesn't look happy about his sides start to the second half and he has made the first change to his side. Gueye is replaced by Enner Valencia, in a more attacking move for the Toffees."
59',action,"The Boro defence have done well to limit the influence of Ross Barkley and Lukaku today. However both players can change a game within seconds, so Middlesbrough need to be careful as they continue to press for the first goal of the game. Barkley almost had a tap in, after Lukaku passed the ball across the box to him but a combination of Valdes and Gibson makes sure he doesn't get there in time."
58',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Adam Forshaw sub-in Adlène Guédioura . Here is the first substiution of the game, with sub-out Adam Forshaw being the man coming off against his former side. Forshaw is replaced by transfer deadline day signing, sub-in Adlène Guédioura."
55',action,"Excellent start to the second period by Middlesbrough, but they need to try and make their possession and chances count here!"
53',action,"It's been a while since Middlesbrough beat Everton in the Premier League! They have managed just one win in their last 12 Premier League games against Everton (D4 L7), with goals from Yakubu and Mark Viduka securing a 2-1 victory in October 2006."
51',action,"Forshaw whips the ball into the box, but Everton manage to clear the initial danger. Negredo then gets his head to the rebound, but his effort is straight at Robles who comfortably gathers the ball."
50',action,Another driving run from Traore forces Coleman into making a rash challenge on the edge of the box and Traore is fouled. Free-kick in a good position coming up for Boro!
49',action,"This is a very positive start to the second half by Middlesbrough. They are causing Everton a lot of problems at the moment, domianting possession and forcing Everton back into their own half."
47',action,"Traore is looking very dangerous today, if Boro are to score here it is likely that he will have played a part in it. The Boro man used his pace and power to dribble past Coleman and Gueye, he then fires a powerful shot at goal but it was always going wide."
46',action,"Boro have a corner within seconds of the re-start! Coleman conceding the set piece. The ball into the box is looking for Gibson, but the Everton defence do well and clear the danger."
46',action,The second half is underway!
,action,"It's goalless here at the Riverside between Middlesbrough and Everton, but both teams have had good chances to score. The Toffees have had the better chances, with Lookman and Lukaku forcing Valdes into making a couple of superb saves to keep the score level."
,action,HALF-TIME: MIDDLESBROUGH 0-0 EVERTON
45'+2',action,That's the half-time whistle!
44',action,"Chambers is back on the pitch now for Boro, looks like he is trying to run off the ankle injury he picked up. Looks like we will be having two minutes of injury time played here as well."
42',action,Brief stoppage in play here as Chambers is down injured after his attempt to block Lookman's shot.
40',action,"GREAT SAVE! Coleman once again breaks down the right, he powers past Fabio before whipping the ball into the box which is superbly chested down by Lookman, who then tries to beat Valdes at his near post. The Boro keeper made himself big and made a very good save. Lookman then has another chance to score just seconds later! This time Callum Chambers blocks his effort."
38',action,"Coleman has the beating of Stuani down the right flank, the full-back is constantly roaming forward and trying to feed Lukaku in the box. Not long to go until the half-time whistle now, can either side break the deadlock?"
36',action,Negredo is often being left isolated up top for Boro as the hosts try to pack the midfield. The striker is struggling to link up with his teammates because they are simply too far away on many occasions so far today.
34',action,"This game is end to end at the moment, both teams are looking lively going forward but they are both making silly mistakes in the middle of the pitch which could e costly. So far no goals here."
31',yellow-card,Yellow Card Adam Clayton. The first player to go into the referee's book is Adam Clayton.
31',action,"HE SHOULD'VE SCORED! Just as Boro looked dangerous at one end, Everton break and almost score! Bernado makes an error on the half-way line which Davies picks up and plays the ball through to Lukaku who is through on goal. The Belgian should've scored as he only had the keeper to beat, but Valdes made himself big and pulled off an excellent save."
29',action,"Brilliant run from Traore! He beats three Everton players, he looks to take the shot at goal but lays it off to Negredo instead. The ball then comes back to him in the middle of the box but he and Stuani both go far the ball and get in each others way!"
28',action,"CHANCE BORO! There was hesitation in the Everton defence as the ball came to Negredo in the box. Ashley Williams missed the ball and Negredo got the ball to the byline before pulling it back to Stuani, however Williams gets back well to block the shot. A huge confidence boost to Boro!"
26',action,"Everton are starting to ramp up the pressure on Middlesbrough now, looking to break the deadlock. Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman are getting forward from the full-back positions at every opportunity, which is forcing the hosts deeper and deeper at the moment."
24',action,"EXCELLENT TACKLE! Traore does brilliantly to dispose of Lookman within the penalty box. The winger uses his pace to get into the box and is about to cross to Romelu Lukaku, when Traore times an excellent sliding tackle and wins the ball back for Boro."
22',action,"Great play by Fabio down the left flank for Boro! The full-back finds plenty of space down the wing and uses his pace to get away from Seamus Coleman, before whipping a good ball into the box. However his teammates failed to get on the end of it, with Everton marking them well."
20',action,Plenty of groans around the Riverside Stadium when the ball goes backwards when in Middlesbrough's possession. These home supporters haven't seen many Boro goals here this season.
18',action,"Neither side is yet to fashion a clear-cut chance at goal today. Everton saw more of the ball in the early stages of the game, but the hosts have done well and grown into the game."
16',action,"First corner of the game goes to Boro. Forshaw whips the ball into the box, looking for Ben Gibson but it is well cleared. However the ball then falls to Stuani on the edge of the box, who fires a shot at goal but it goes well wide."
14',action,"CHANCE BORO! Alvaro Negredo held the ball up brilliantly and layed it off to Forshaw who had made the run from deep. However Forshaw couldn't make his mind up quick enough, he tried to pass to Traore but it was blocked and then when the ball falls back to him in the box Joel Robles is quick off his line to clear the danger."
12',action,"Good Everton possession here, however they need to be careful as Boro are looking to counter attack at every opportunity. Adam Forshaw just managed to nip the ball off Morgan Schneiderlin deep in the Toffees half. The midfielder goes to take a shot at goal but the shot is blocked."
11',action,"STAT: The Toffees have kept clean sheets in three of their last four Premier League visits to the Riverside Stadium (losing one), winning all three of those games."
9',action,One player who has been very lively so far for Everton today is youngster Ademola Lookman. The winger is always his pace to cause the Boro defence problems.
7',action,The Toffees look full of confidence here and will be positive about their chances of taking all three points back to Mereyside tonight. However Boro are so far limiting their possession of the ball to the middle of the pitch and are keeping them away from their final third.
5',action,"CHANCE! Tom Davies times his run perfectly behind the Boro backline, Seamus Coleman lofts the ball up to him and the 18-year-old is just inches away from getting on the end of the pass with no Boro defenders near him. However Victor Valdes is quick off his line and slides to gather the ball. Good stuff from Everton early on."
3',action,"There is a good atmosphere here at the Riverside as Boro begin the game well, pressuring the Toffees high up the pitch and limiting the amount of possession they have."
2',action,"Boro have scored the fewest home league goals this season, scoring just 11 goals. The hosts have also attempted the fewest shots on target in the league this season (56) and are the only side to have failed to post a shot on target in more than one Premier League game."
