,action,"The referee blows his whistle for the final time and denies Darmstadt the opportunity to try and find a late equaliser. They certainly would have deserved it, as they defended extremely well and are incredibly unlucky to leave without a point. Bayern struggled for most of the afternoon and looked bereft of ideas in front of goal, leaving them needing Costa to bail them out with an absolutely stunning strike from 30 yards out."
,action,FULL-TIME: DARMSTADT 0-1 BAYERN MUNICH
90'+3',action,"Obinna immediately battles with Martinez on the edge of the Bayern penalty area, but he's slightly heavy-handed in his dealing with the defender and ends up pushing him to the ground, resulting in a free-kick for the visitors."

90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will three minutes of added time.
89',action,"Thiago charges through the middle of the pitch and heads towards the Darmstadt box before slotting a through-ball towards Lewandowski, but the striker isn't quick enough to reach the pass ahead of Fedetskiy, who then knocks the ball safely back to Esser."
87',action,"Kimmich is set up by a clever pass from Lewandowski and quickly rushes into the right-hand side of the Darmstadt penalty area before trying to cut the ball back to Thiago, but Holland is there to cut out the danger with an outstretched leg."
85',action,"Heller gets himself into a good position over on the left wing once again before this time picking out a teammate with a swinging cross, but Colak is unable to make decent contact with the ball with his diving header and fails to beat Neuer at the near post."
84',action,"Ribery, who has looked good since coming on to the pitch, weaves his way down the left flank before cutting into the penalty area, but Fedetskiy is there to dispossess the Frenchman with a well-timed sliding tackle before forcing Alaba into poking the ball out for a goal-kick."
82',action,"Heller darts down the left wing on a great run and does well to reach the byline. He then cuts inside and chips a deft pass into the heart of the Bayern box, but there's nobody there to meet it and the danger is easily dealt with by Alonso."
80',substitution,Substitution sub-out Thomas Müller sub-in Joshua Kimmich . Muller makes way for sub-in Joshua Kimmich in a late change for Bayern.
79',action,"Bayern pile plenty of bodies forward as they try to find a second goal that would surely result in all three points going back to Bavaria, but Costa is unable to weave his way into the penalty area and ends up losing out over on the right wing."
78',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Peter Niemeyer sub-in Antonio-Mirko Colak . Darmstadt have made a substitution and, unsurprisingly, it's an attacking one, with sub-in Antonio-Mirko Colak coming on to replace Niemeyer."
76',action,"What a chance for Niemeyer! Gondorf's curling shot from the free-kick is saved by Neuer but parried straight to Niemeyer, who then sees his follow-up headed effort collected by the Bayern goalkeeper."
75',yellow-card,Yellow Card Xabier Alonso Olano. Alonso is also booked for a clumsy challenge in the build-up to that chance for Darmstadt. Bayern were all over the place at the back!
75',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Mats Hummels. Darmstadt charge forward on a great attacking move as they desperately try to get themselves back into the game, and Vrancic does well to reach the edge of the Bayern penalty area before being fouled by Hummels, who gives away a free-kick in an extremely dangerous position."
73',action,"Alaba sprints down the left flank and gets himself into a great position before swinging a cross towards Muller, but the forward is unable to make decent contact with the ball and sends it flying away from goal."

71',goal,"Goal Douglas Costa de Souza. GOAL! Bayern have finally taken the lead! A free-kick is taken quickly and sent short to Costa, who cuts on to his left foot and unleashes an absolute rocket of a strike that swerves past the outstretched limbs of Esser and into the roof of the net. What a strike by the Brazilian!"
69',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Arturo Erasmo Vidal Pardo sub-in Franck Bilal Ribéry . Bayern have made a change as they desperately try to find an opening, and it's Franck Ribery that Ancelotti has brought on to replace Vidal, who was unable to influence the game."
68',action,"Thiago cuts inside from the left flank before unleashing a thumping strike from 25 yards out, but it ends up flying straight into the back of Gondorf's head before bouncing over to the right wing, leaving the Darmstadt midfielder in a heap on the floor and in a lot of discomfort."
66',action,"Vital interception by Hummels! Bayern lose possession midway inside the Darmstadt half of the pitch and allow the hosts to break away quickly. A lofted pass is fired into the path of Schipplock, who is all alone on the edge of the penalty area, but Hummels darts in front of the striker to cut out the danger at the vital moment."
65',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Jan Rosenthal sub-in Florian Jungwirth . Darmstadt have decided to make their first substitution of the game, with Rosenthal making way for sub-in Florian Jungwirth."

62',action,"Costa switches with Muller and takes up a good position over on the right wing, but he's unable to find much joy overthere either as he swings an overhit cross several yards over the head of Lewandowski and out for a goal-kick."
60',action,"Alaba skips past his marker before swinging a looping cross into the heart of the Darmstadt penalty area. Muller, who has found it difficult to get into the game, rises high and meets the ball in front of goal, but his headed effort is poor and sails well wide of the goal."
58',action,"So close from Vrancic! After dealing with the danger, Darmstadt quickly push forward on a great counter-attack before Holland is clumsily fouled by Rafinha just outside of the Bayern penalty area. Vrancic steps up and unleashes a wonderful curling strike, but it ends up flying just a yard or so wide of the near post."
57',action,"Costa is bundled over by Sirigu midway down the left flank and wins Bayern a free-kick in an advantageous position. Thiago steps up and curls a cross towards the near post, but it's easily dealt with by Vrancic under very little pressure."
56',action,"Chance for Lewandowski! A lovely cross-field pass from Alonso finds Rafinha deep down the right wing, and the Brazilian then volleys a clever cross into the feet of Lewandowski. He's in a good position in front of goal and quickly tries to beat Esser with a volley of his own, but he's unable to make decent contact with the ball and sends it comfortably wide of the goal."
54',action,"Muller goes close! Lewandowski drops into a pocket of space just outside of the Darmstadt box before poking a pass into the path of Muller, but the latter is unable to beat Esser and instead sees his volleyed strike pushed away by the goalkeeper."

50',action,"Great chance for Gondorf! Rosenthal and Heller link up brilliantly deep down the left flank after doing well to break away quickly. The latter then swings a cross over to Sven Schipplock, who quickly nods the ball down to Gondorf, but the midfielder's quickly-taken shot from just inside the penalty area sails over the top of the crossbar."
48',action,"Costa darts down the left wing on a great run before firing a bouncing cross into the Darmstadt penalty area and towards Muller, but Esser is able to collect the ball ahead of the forward before accidentally being clattered into by Holland.

,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"Bayern have absolutely bossed possession thus far and have continuously put Darmstadt under plenty of pressure, but the home side have dealt with everything that has been thrown at them thanks to plenty of excellent defending.

,action,HALF-TIME: DARMSTADT 0-0 BAYERN MUNICH
45',action,"Darmstadt try to push forward on one last attacking move by breaking down the right wing, but they're unable to carve out a chance on goal before the referee brings an end to what has been a frustrating first half for Bayern."
44',action,"The free-kick is in a great position 25 yards away from goal and allows Lewandowski the opportunity to curl a strike towards the top left-hand corner of the net, but there's slightly too much power behind his effort and it fails to hit the target."
43',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Jan Rosenthal. Xabi Alonso muscles his way through the middle of the pitch before being brought crashing to the ground by a hefty tackle from Rosenthal. The referee initially doesn't seem to think badly of the challenge, but after a few seconds he eventually awards a free-kick to Bayern before showing the attacking midfielder a yellow card."
41',action,"Darmstadt push forward on a rare foray into the Bayern half of the pitch before doing well to win themselves a corner over on the right flank. It's curled in by Gondorf and quickly deflects out to Vrancic, who then fires a shot several yards over the top of the crossbar from the edge of the penalty area."
40',action,"Holland accidentally handles the ball deep down the right wing and concedes a free-kick in a very dangerous position. Costa steps up and sends a super delivery right on to the head of Hummels, but, off balance, the centre-back can only send his headed effort sailing over the top of the crossbar. He immediately screams to the referee for a penalty after seemingly being pushed by Vrancic, but the referee doesn't agree and awards the hosts a goal-kick."
38',action,"Thiago cuts inside from the left flank and desperately tries to find a route through to the Darmstadt penalty area, but the home side have every available player back to defend and are easily able to close down the midfielder before poking the ball away from his feet."
36',action,"Mario Vrancic panics just outside of the Darmstadt penalty area and concedes possession in a very dangerous position, but Bayern are unable to take advantage of the error thanks to excellent defending from Sulu, who rushed across the box to fire the ball away from Lewandowski."
34',action,"Lewandowski almost opens the scoring! The Polish striker is tugged back by Jerome Gondorf as he tries to muscle his way towards the Darmstadt penalty area, and Bayern are awarded a free-kick in a dangerous position. Thiago steps up and curls a danger cross into the middle of the box, where it finds Lewandowski, but his headed effort ends up bouncing just a yard or so wide of the far post."
32',action,"Almost a chance for Vidal! Lewandowski drops deep to pick up the ball and quickly spots a good run forward from Vidal. The Chilean is in acres of space and the striker swiftly tries to tee him up, but his chipped pass into the box is poorly hit and sails harmlessly out of play for a goal-kick."
30',action,"Holland feeds Heller over on the left flank before the winger takes on both Rafinha and Vidal near to the corner flag. He twists and turns as he attempts to find a way past the Bayern duo, but he's unable to do so and eventually loses out to the Brazilian."
28',action,"Alaba skips down the left wing and flies past his marker with ease before firing a cross over to Lewandowski, who is camped on the penalty spot, but Holland darts across the box before sticking out a foot to deal with the danger at the vital moment."

24',action,"Chance for Rosenthal! The ball bounces around the edge of the Bayern penalty area before finding Rosenthal over on the left wing, but the attacking midfielder's thumping volley fails to test Neuer and instead sails a few yards wide of the near post."
22',action,"Darmstadt are unable to break away on a counter-attack and lose the ball on the halfway line, allowing Bayern to come back once again.

21',action,"Rafinha takes on Fabian Holland deep down the right flank before sending yet another looping cross into the Darmstadt penalty area and towards Lewandowski, but it's poorly hit by the full-back and can only find the head of Fedetskiy."
19',action,"Bayern have largely dominated possession thus far, but they've so far failed to cause Darmstadt too many problems. The home side seem content to sit back and soak up the pressure before hitting the reigning champions on the break, which they've done well on a few occasions."
17',action,"Darmstadt are unable to break out of their own half of the pitch and decide to sit deep as Bayern push forward once again. This time it's Costa who whips a cross into the middle of the hosts' box but fails to pick out Robert Lewandowski, who was close to pouncing on the ball but lost out at the last moment."
15',action,"Rafinha sprints down the right wing on a marauding run before trying to pick out Thomas Muller with a curling cross, but Artem Fedetskiy is there to beat the forward to the ball and head it out of the Darmstadt penalty area."
13',action,"Another chance for Rosenthal! The corner initially fails to result in a chance on goal before Darmstadt push forward once again. Heller gets himself into a good position over on the left flank and whips a dangerous cross over to Rosenthal at the far post, but the attacking midfielder is flagged offside as soon as his downward header is pushed away by Manuel Neuer."
12',action,"Sirigu and Thiago battle for the ball deep down the right wing before the former is brought crashing to the ground, resulting in a free-kick for the home side in a dangerous position.

10',action,"Bayern come back once again as they continue putting pressure on Darmstadt. They work the ball around patiently before Alaba swings a cross in from the left flank, but it fails to find a red shirt in front of goal and is easily dealt with by Michael Esser in the middle of the goal."
8',action,"Douglas Costa twists and turns down the left flank before cutting into the Darmstadt penalty area and teeing up David Alaba, but just as the full-back is about to make contact with the ball at the near post, Aytac Sulu dives in front of the Austrian before thumping the ball away from danger."
6',action,"Jan Rosenthal goes close! The resulting set-piece is swung towards the near post and finds Rosenthal in a great position, but his towering header ends up flying just wide of the near post and into the side-netting."
5',action,"A half-hearted Bayern attacking move comes to an end, allowing Darmstadt the opportunity to hit the visitors on a quick counter-attack. They do well to break down the right flank and put the reigning champions under plenty of pressure, and Heller then fires a swinging shot off a defender and out for a corner."
3',action,"After dealing with the danger, Bayern quickly move the ball around midway inside the Darmstadt half of the pitch before Arturo Vidal unleashes a thumping strike from 30 yards out, but there's far too much power behind his shot and it sails comfortably over the top of the crossbar."
2',action,"Early chance for Sandro Sirigu! Marcel Heller darts down the left wing on a great run before cutting a pass into the penalty area and over to Sirigu, but he's closed down quickly and is unable to guide his first-time strike past Thiago Alcantara."

,action,"Darmstadt’s tough start to the campaign resulted in the sacking of Norbert Meier at the start of the month, and they head into today’s tough clash with interim boss Ramon Berndroth at the helm. The former FSV Frankfurt boss was unable to guide his side to a positive result against Freiburg in his first game in charge, and he will no doubt be expecting another mammoth test here this afternoon."
,action,"In stark contrast, Darmstadt have suffered a miserable two months and are now without a league win since October 22nd. Since then they have lost seven consecutive games, with fourth-tier Astoria Walldorf also finding joy against them in what was an embarrassing cup defeat for the under-pressure Lilies."
,action,"Those last three games have certainly seen Bayern play with more freedom, and they seem to be thoroughly enjoying themselves at the moment. They managed to score 10 goals during that period, with Wolfsburg shipping five in a game that saw Thomas Muller finally break his Bundesliga duck with a second-half goal."
,action,"RB Leipzig’s victory against Hertha Berlin sent them back to the top of the table yesterday afternoon, but Bayern can reach the summit once again with a win here today. The Bavarians haven’t looked entirely convincing under Carlo Ancelotti and are yet to set the league alight, but they nonetheless head to Darmstadt with three consecutive Bundesliga victories under their belts."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Bundesliga game between Darmstadt and Bayern Munich at the Jonathan Heimes Stadion am Bollenfalltor.
