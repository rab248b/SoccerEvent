90',action,Three minutes of added time will be played.

79',action,The home supporters are trying their best to get behind their side and fire them to victory here. Inter often score in the dying minutes so there is still plenty of hope.
76',action,"Chievo are starting to sit deeper and deeper now as Inter pile on the pressure here in search of a winning goal. However it looks like the visitors now have a five-man defence in order to try and hold onto a point, which would be a very good result for them."

62',action,"Inter have a free-kick in a very good position, around 30 yards from goal and it is the substitute Eder to take it. Eder fires the ball straight at Radovanović who blocks the ball with his arms and Inter have another free-kick, in an even better position."

57',action,"Inter are pushing lots of players forward in search of an equaliser, which is allowing Chievo to mount plenty of counter-attacks when they manage to win the ball back. So Inter need to be careful of conceding another goal."

53',action,"WHAT A SAVE! Sorrentino makes another fantastic stop to deny Inter. Perisic gets up in the box and fires a powerful header at goal, he thinks he has scored but the Chevio keeper gets his body behind the ball and makes a superb save. Perisic can't believe that he didn't score then."

,action,The teams are back out here at the San Siro and the second half is almost ready to begin!

42',action,Not long to go until the half-time whistle now. Can Inter convert their dominance into goals?

25',action,"Another Inter chance! Danilo D'Ambrosio brings the ball forward from the right-back position and plays a good ball behind the Chievo defence to Icardi, however he is forced slightly wide and he can't get his foot around the ball, which forces his shot to go narrowly wide of the goal."
23',action,"PENALTY SHOUT! Icardi once again had the ball in the box and fired a shot at goal which was blocked by Alessandro Gamberini. The Inter skipper is saying that his shot was blocked by the Chievo defenders arm, but none of the officials agree. No penalty."

6',action,"Ivan Perisic does very well down the left wing to beat his man and then whip a ball into the box which Mauro Icardi almost gets on the end of, but it was slightly too high.
