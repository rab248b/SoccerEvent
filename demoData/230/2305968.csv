,action,Full-time: Udinese 2-1 AC Milan
90'+5',action,"WHAT A SAVE FROM DONNARUMMA!!! Zapata is clean through on goal and looks almost certain to score just 8 yards out from goal, but Donnarumma somehow makes himself big and holds onto the shot."
90'+4',action,CLOSE FROM THEREAU!! The Frenchman very nearly seals it for Udinese as he curls a wonderful effort narrowly over the bar from the edge of the box with Donnarumma well beaten.
90'+2',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Rodrigo Javier de Paul sub-in Thomas Heurtaux . Udinese are making another change now to take some more time of the game with De Paul, who’s goal looks like it could be the winner, is replaced by sub-in Thomas Heurtaux."
90'+1',action,We’re into six minutes of added time here.
89',action,"Milan give the ball away twice in quick succession and Udinese break away through Angella on the right, and having won his side a corner, the right-back signals to the crowd to get behind his team."
87',action,"OFF THE POST!! Milan are desperately searching for an equaliser and so nearly get it, as Karnezis fails to hold on to a corner and Lapadula drills the ball into the outside of the post from a tight angle on the rebound."
85',action,"CLOSE!! Hallfredsson picks the ball up in acres of space in midfield and fires a strong left-footed effort towards goal from 25 yards out, but it goes narrowly wide of the left-hand post as Donnarumma scrambles across his goal."
83',yellow-card,Yellow Card Gabriele Angella. Things are just becoming a little bit scrappy now as Angella becomes the latest player to go into the book.
81',action,The home crowd are really finding their voice now as their side look to see out what would be a first league win of 2017.
79',action,"Udinese break quickly through Thereau and Zapata, but as the latter peels off out wide to receive the pass there is no one in the middle and his low cross is easily dealt with by the Milan defence."
77',action,Things are just starting to get a little bit heated now as referee Banti has to go over and tell Vincenzo Montella to calm down in the dugout.
75',action,"Close! Milan nearly reply straight away as Suso picks out Pasalic in the middle with a good cross from the right, but the midfielder can’t get a clean connection on it and it loops tamely into Karnezis’s arms."
74',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Mattia De Sciglio sub-in Leonel Ezequiel Vangioni . De Sciglio isn't going to be able to continue following that challenge from De Paul, and he's replaced by sub-in Leonel Ezequiel Vangioni."
73',assist,"Assist Jakub Jankto. Jankto played the ball into De Paul for the goal, but it was all of the winger's own making in truth."
73',goal,"Goal Rodrigo Javier de Paul. GOOOOAALLLLLL!!!! Udinese take the lead out of nowhere!! Moments after being booked, De Paul drills the ball into the far corner from 20 yards out and Donnarumma is furious with himself as he got a good hand to that."

71',yellow-card,Yellow Card Rodrigo Javier de Paul. De Paul is shown a yellow card for a nasty lunge on De Sciglio. He protests at first but in reality he can have no complaints as it was a pretty rash tackle after the ball had gone.
69',action,"The game is really starting to open up now as Paletta takes the sting out of a Zapata shot at one end, making it easy for Donnarumma to gather, before Bacca goes on a driving run into the box at the other only to run the ball out of play for a goal kick."

60',action,"Milan are starting to up the tempo here as Deulofeu gets around the outside of Angella and crosses from the by-line, but Jankto is in a really good position on the edge of the six yard box to smash the ball clear."
57',action,"Close!! Bacca very nearly puts Milan back ahead as he drills a low shot towards goal from the edge of the box which Karnezis makes a real mess of despite the ball appearing to go straight at him, as it deflects off his leg and wide of the goal."
56',action,Hallfredsson goes for goal from the free-kick but hits it straight into the wall. That was a pretty poor effort from the Icelandic midfielder in truth.

51',action,"Super save from Donnarumma!! Thereau plays the ball into the path of Zapata inside the left-hand edge of the penalty box, but the ball just gets away from the striker and the Milan keeper comes off his lines really well to block the shot from a tight angle."

46',action,Kick-off! AC Milan get the second half underway.
,action,"Neither manager will be too disappointed with their side’s display, although Vincenzo Montella may well ask his midfield to stick closer to Hallfredsson and Fofana in the second half, as the Udinese pair have had plenty of space in the middle of the pitch throughout the first 45 minutes."
,action,"It’s all square here at the Stadio Fruili after Cyril Thereau cancelled out Giacomo Bonaventura’s early opener. Both sides have lost players to injury though, with Bonaventura being forced off for Milan before right-back Marco Faraoni was replaced for Udinese."

33',action,"Suso once again cuts inside onto his left foot from that right-hand side and looks for Bacca in the middle, but the substitute Angella gets up well to head it away from danger."

27',substitution,Substitution sub-out Giacomo Bonaventura sub-in Gerard Deulofeu Lázaro . Milan are going to be forced into a change now as the goal-scorer Bonaventura isn’t going to be able to continue. Gerard Deulofeu comes on in his place for his Serie A debut.
24',action,"HUGE CHANCE FOR FARAONI! The right-back has got forward really well in the early stages and should have brought his side level here, as he gets above Mattia De Sciglio at the back post but can only head wide from five yards out."
22',action,Bonaventura is down in the corner having stretched to block Faraoni’s cross. It appears to be a groin injury but he’s back to his feet now.

17',action,"Rodrigo De Paul draws the foul from Locatelli close to halfway, but Udinese fail to keep possession for long resulting in momentary groans from the home crowd."
15',action,"Carlos Bacca appears have created an opening for Milan with a good turn on the edge of the box, but his control just lets him down before attempting an ambitious through ball for Suso, which is too heavy for the Spaniard to get on the end of."

11',action,"Udinese look to hit back quickly as they work the ball wide to Marco Faraoni in space on the right, but the full-back’s cross is a poor one and goes straight into the arms of Donnarumma."
8',assist,Assist Jesús Joaquín Fernández Sáez de la Torre. Suso has made a bright start to this game and picked out his teammate with a superb cross there.

4',action,Larangeira Danilo has gone down away from the ball clutching his ribs here and looks to be struggling. Udinese will certainly not want to lose their captain this early on.
2',action,"Ignazio Abate gifts the ball straight to Duvan Zapata inside the Milan half, but Manuel Locatelli gets an important toe in to prevent the striker breaking away towards goal."
