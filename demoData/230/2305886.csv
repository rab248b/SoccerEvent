,action,"The referee blows his whistle for the final time and the whole crowd go wild! That victory will go down as one of Genoa's finest, and it's one that they certainly deserve after putting in an excellent shift from start to finish. They started the game brilliantly and did wonderfully well to put a poor Juventus defence under plenty of pressure, and from then onwards they defended resolutely to make the reigning champions look incredibly ordinary."
,action,FULL-TIME: GENOA 3-1 JUVENTUS
90'+5',action,"Free header for Mandzukic! Pjanic sends a wonderful chipped cross into the middle of the penalty area and finds Mandzukic in acres of space, but, somehow, the Croatian is unable to find the back of the net with his header from close range and sends it wide of the goal."
90'+4',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Davide Biraschi. Cuadrado cuts inside from the right wing and heads towards the penalty area before being fouled by Biraschi, resulting in a late free-kick for Juventus and a yellow card for the substitute. Will they take advantage of this one too?"
90'+3',action,"The ball pinballs around the edge of the Genoa penalty area as Juventus desperately try to find a way through the sea of red and blue shirts camped in front of them, but they're unable to do so and Pjanic eventually pokes a poor pass straight into the hands of Perin."
90'+1',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Stefano Sturaro. Juventus win themselves a corner over on the left wing, but it fails to result in a chance on goal. Laxalt immediately bursts forward on a quick counter and does well to charge down the right flank, but Sturaro sticks out an arm and clumsily fouls the wing-back to earn himself a late yellow card."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be five minutes of added time.
89',action,"After spending the last few minutes on the back foot, Genoa are finally able to break forward and Laxalt does well to win them a corner over on the left flank. It's curled into the heart of the penalty area and causes a few problems for Juventus, but Benatia is just about able to clear the danger before his side are awarded a free-kick for pushing inside the box."
88',substitution,Substitution sub-out Lucas Ariel Ocampos sub-in Davide Biraschi . And now Genoa have brought on sub-in Davide Biraschi for Ocampos in a defensive change.
87',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Luca Rigoni sub-in Serge Gakpé . Genoa have made a late substitution, with Serge Gakpe coming on to take the place of Rigoni."
86',action,"Chance for Sturaro! Higuain charges towards the Genoa penalty area before doing well to tee up Sturaro in acres of space, but his attempted shot from 25 yards out is horribly hit and ends up sailing far over the top of the crossbar."
84',action,"Juventus keep pushing forward as they desperately try to find a second goal, but Mandzukic ends up firing a shot from the edge of the penalty area over the crossbar after doing well to link up with Cuadrado. Genoa are certainly starting to look a little jaded as we near the final five minutes of the game."
82',goal,Goal Miralem Pjanić. GOAL! Yes they can! Pjanic steps up and finally scores Juventus' first goal of the game with a beautiful curling free-kick that flies past Perin and into the top left-hand corner of the net.
81',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Isaac Cofie. Slightly sloppy play from Genoa allows Mandzukic to break towards the Genoa penalty area, and just as he's about to reach the box he's brought down by a poor foul from Cofie, who receives a yellow card and concedes a free-kick in a very dangerous position 20 yards away from goal. Can Juventus make it count?"
79',action,"After spending a few moments on the back foot, Juventus move the ball around nicely before Sandro whips a cross into the heart of the penalty area. It finds Higuain in front of goal, but the striker is unable to make decent contact with the ball and sends it flying back out of the box."
77',yellow-card,Yellow Card Juan Guillermo Cuadrado Bello. Ouch! Cudrado flies into Laxalt and brings the Uruguayan crashing to the ground with a hefty sliding challenge that results in a yellow card for the Colombian and another free-kick for Genoa in a dangerous position over on the left wing.
76',action,"Play gets underway once again and the free-kick is whipped into the heart of the penalty area by Laxalt. Juventus are just about to deal with the danger but can only clear the ball as far as Edenilson, who then blasts an audacious 30-yard strike just a few yards wide of the near post."
75',action,"Things have become even worse for Juventus, as Alves seems to be really struggling after the coming together with Ocampos and is stretchered off the pitch. It looks as if the visitors are going to have to finish the game with 10 men if the Brazilian can't make a quick recovery."
74',action,"A clumsy challenge from Alves brings Ocampos crashing to the ground, and it also leaves the Juventus defender in a heap on the floor and in serious discomfort. He seemed to catch the Genoa man nastily from behind, and it's he who has come off the worst after giving away a free-kick in a dangerous position."
72',action,"Higuain battles his way down the right wing before trying to tee up Alves with a poked through-ball into the path of the Brazilian, but his pass is completely overhit and, not for the first time this afternoon, makes life easy for Perin, who is easily able to collect the ball under no pressure whatsoever."
71',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Sami Khedira sub-in Stefano Sturaro . Juventus have made their final alteration of the game, with sub-in Stefano Sturaro coming on to replace Khedira."
70',action,"Mandzukic goes close! A chipped cross from Cuadrado on the right-hand side of the box finds Mandzukic at the far post, but the Croatian is unable to get a shot away after being closed down by Perin, Burdisso and Izzo, and he eventually loses out to a smart tackle from the latter."
69',action,"Higuain, who has seen little of the ball since coming on to the pitch, holds off his marker on the edge of the penalty area before trying to tee up Cuadrado, but he's eventually closed down and dispossessed by a group of Genoa players, who do well to stick with the striker."
68',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Darko Lazović sub-in Edenilson Andrade dos Santos . Genoa have made their first substitution of the afternoon, with Lazovic making way for Edenilson."
66',action,"Sandro battles with Lazovic and skips past the Serbian deep down the left flank before curling a deep cross over to the far post, but it's slightly overhit and is easily dealt with by Laxalt before it can find a white shirt in front of goal."
64',action,"Poor play by Cuadrado! Again, Juventus exhibit good build-up play as they try to carve out another chance on goal, but the final pass from Cuadrado towards Mandzukic is a terrible one and ends up rolling harmlessly into the hands of Perin."
63',action,"Pjanic and Cuadrado link up well deep down the right wing before the latter pokes a low cross into the path of Mandzukic at the near post, but the Croatian is closed down quickly and has to settle for a corner."
61',action,"Alves dives in to Laxalt and brings the Genoa man crashing to the ground, resulting in a free-kick for the home side in a very dangerous position deep down the left wing. It's sent in to the heart of the penalty area and almost finds a red and blue shirt, but Rugani is just about able to scoop the ball away from danger at the vital moment."
59',action,"Pjanic gets himself into a good position over on the right flank before firing a low cross into the middle of the Genoa box, but it ends up deflected out for another Juventus corner. The Bosnian midfielder's cross from the set-piece is good and picks out Benatia, but the defender's header is poorly executed and sails well wide of the goal."
57',action,"Simeone almost makes it 4-0! A terrible pass from Benatia can only find Lazovic and allows Genoa to fly forward on another excellent counter-attack. The Serbian picks out Isaac Cofie, who sprints forward before teeing up Simeone, but the youngster's low shot is turned round the near post by the legs of Buffon."
56',action,"Izzo climbs all over the back of Mandzukic and gives away a free-kick midway inside the Genoa half of the pitch, but the cross from the set-piece isn't the greatest and is easily dealt with by the home side."
54',action,"Higuain immediately makes an impact as he cuts inside from the right wing and shoots from the edge of the penalty area, but his strike takes a deflection off a Genoa defender that sends it bouncing into the hands of Perin at the near post."
53',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Stephan Lichtsteiner sub-in Gonzalo Gerardo Higuaín . Juventus have made their second change of the game, and it's an attacking one, with Lichtsteiner making way for Gonzalo Higuain."
52',action,"What a chance for Khedira! A low cross-cum-shot from Lichtsteiner almost finds the back of the net but is deflected behind for a corner over on the right wing. It's thumped into the box and finds Rugani, who immediately nods the ball down to Khedira, but the German's first-time volley from a few yards out fails to hit the target. He really should have buried that!"
51',action,"Juventus have started the second half far better than they finished the first, but Genoa are now sitting deep and continuing to make life tough for the visitors. With three goals under their belts, the Rossoblu have no need to push too far forward and can now concentrate entirely on defending their lead."
49',action,"Another chance for Mandzukic! Again, Pjanic bursts forward on a marauding run before chipping a cross into the heart of the box and towards Mandzukic, but the striker is unable to make contact with the ball and fails to take the opportunity to head in his side's first goal of the afternoon."
48',action,"Juventus come back once again before another lofted pass is fired towards Mandzukic, but this time it's overhit and sails over the head of the Croatian before the ball bounces into the hands of Perin in the middle of the Genoa goal."
47',action,"Much better from Juventus! A lofted pass is thumped forward and finds Mandzukic on the edge of the penalty area. He quickly back-heels the ball over to Pjanic, who then unleashes a rocket of a shot, but his effort on goal flies just past the far post after beating the outstretched arms of Perin."
46',action,And we're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"Wow, what a stunning first half that was! Before the game, not even the most optimistic of Genoa fans would have predicted that their side could be 3-0 up at half-time, but thanks to a wonderful performance from the Rossoblu, that's where they find themselves. They've been helped by poor play from Juventus, who have been atrocious at the back and far too lax inside the final third of the pitch. Allegri has already been forced into taking off Bonucci due to an injury that the defender picked up, but he may think about making another during the break as he desperately tries to find a way to get his side back into the game."
,action,HALF-TIME: GENOA 3-0 JUVENTUS
45'+3',action,"Lichtsteiner makes a smart move down the right flank and Pjanic tries to pick him out with a cross-field pass, but the Bosnian's ball forward is completely overhit and sails harmlessly out of play for a goal-kick."
45'+2',action,"Laxalt darts down the left wing on a great run before firing a low cross off Rugani and out for a throw-in. It's sent short and worked over to Rincon, who then breaks into the Juventus box, but Hernanes is there to keep the midfielder at bay before winning his side a free-kick."
45'+1',action,"Rigoni holds up the ball brilliantly as he tries to kick-start another Genoa counter-attack. He shrugs off three Juventus players before working the ball over to the right flank, but, with half-time fast approaching, the home side decide to hold on to the ball and run down the clock."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be three minutes of added time.
43',action,"Alves pushes into the Genoa half of the pitch before firing a low pass up to Cuadrado. The Colombian is in a good position on the hosts' box and tries to spin quickly, but he's immediately closed down by two defenders and is quickly dispossessed."
41',action,"Mandzukic goes down inside the penalty area, but nothing is given! Juventus keep putting Genoa under pressure as they try to find their first goal of the game, and the ball eventually finds Mandzukic over on the right-hand side of the penalty area. However, as soon as he picks up possession he's brought down from behind by Ocampos, but the referee isn't at all interested in the pleas from the visitors and waves play on."
39',action,"Miralem Pjanic goes close! Cuadrado is once again brought down deep down the left wing, and Juventus win themselves another free-kick in a dangerous position. This time, Pjanic decides to shoot from the set-piece, but his curling strike ends up flying just wide of the near post."
37',action,"Genoa hit Juventus on another great counter-attack, and it's one that results in another good chance for the home side. Ocampos charges forward on a marauding run before poking the ball back to Laxalt, who immediately unleashes a low strike that fails to beat Benatia inside the box."
35',action,"Juventus keep pushing forward as they try to find a way back into the game, but no matter what they try to do they just can't seem to beat the sea of red and blue shirts camped in front of them. Genoa have defended incredibly well, but Juventus have made it easy for them with very poor movement in and around the penalty area."
33',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Leonardo Bonucci sub-in Daniele Rugani . Things have gone from bad to worse for Juventus, as Bonucci has pulled up what was seems to be a hamstring injury and has to be replaced by sub-in Daniele Rugani."
31',action,"Cuadrado is fouled deep down the left flank and wins Juventus a free-kick in a dangerous position. It's poorly executed, however, and Sandro's curling cross over to the far post is overhit and fails to find a white shirt."
29',own-goal,"Own Goal Alex Sandro Lobo Silva. GOAL! Genoa have made it 3-0! The corner swings over to the far post, where it finds Rigoni in far too much space. He easily beats his marker in the air before sending a looping volleyed effort towards goal, and bounces off the underside of the crossbar and off the thigh of Sandro before sailing just over the line. What an outstanding opening half an hour!"
28',action,"A half-hearted Juventus attack fizzles out and Genoa push forward on another well-worked counter. They move the ball around quickly before Izzo tries to poke a through-ball towards Simeone, but Benatia is there to send the ball out for a corner."
26',action,"Vital block by Lazovic! Juventus work the ball around nicely and finally carve out a chance on goal thanks to a good run and cross from Mario Mandzukic, but Lazovic darts across the penalty area to meet the ball before it can find Cuadrado in front of goal."
24',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Tomás Eduardo Rincón Hernández. Tomas Rincon, who has been diving into challenges over the past 10 minutes, commits another clumsy foul in the middle of the pitch and becomes the first player to receive a yellow card as a result."
23',action,"Wonderful chance for Rigoni! Laxalt causes problems for the Juventus defence with another excellent cross that bounces into the heart of the box and finds a teammate, but Rigoni is unable to hit the target with his close-range effort and ends up volleying it over the top of the crossbar."
22',action,"Hernanes charges into the Genoa half of the pitch and wins the visitors a free-kick after being fouled by Rincon. It's sent short to Mandzukic, who then pokes the ball towards Sami Khedira over on the left-hand side of the penalty area, but the German is unable to meet it and it fails to result in a chance on goal."
21',action,"Juventus lose the ball in the middle of the pitch and, once again, Genoa immediately hit them on a fierce counter-attack. Rigoni breaks through the middle of the pitch and sends the ball wide to Lazovic, who then cuts inside and fires a cross into the middle of the box. Simeone rises high to try and meet it but isn't quite able to, allowing Alves to clear the danger with a header."
19',action,"Laxalt gets himself into a good position over on the left wing after skipping into the Juventus half of the pitch, but he's unable to find Ocampos in front of him and the ball ends up rolling out for a Juventus throw-in."
17',action,"It just isn't working for Juventus, who don't look at all comfortable. Genoa are putting them under an incredible amount of pressure in the middle of the pitch with their aggressive pressing, and it's disrupting the flow of the visitors' attempted attacking moves."
15',action,"Juventus push forward from the restart and quickly win themselves a corner over on the left wing. It's well dealt with by the Genoa defence before the ball bounces out to Sandro, but the Brazilian's looping cross fails to find Bonucci at the far post and is dealt with by the home side once again."
13',assist,"Assist Darko Lazović. That was an excellent cross from Lazovic that picked out Simeone perfectly, but Juventus really have started the game terribly. They look at sixes and sevens at the back, whilst out wide Lazovic and Laxalt are finding far too much room."
13',goal,"Goal Giovanni Pablo Simeone. GOAL! It's 2-0 to Genoa! Lazovic is left in far too much space over on the right wing and is allowed to skip past Alex Sandro before curling a great cross into the middle of the penalty area. It flies past the disjointed Juventus defence and finds Simeone, who, unmarked in front of goal, immediately beats Buffon once again with a bullet header."
12',action,"Juventus are all over the place at the back! Genoa keep putting the visitors under plenty of pressure as they try to increase their early lead. A low cross from Laxalt deflects off Alves and should be easily dealt with by the league leaders, but there's a mix-up between Bonucci, Benatia and Buffon, and the latter is just about able to collect the ball before Simeone can poke it into the back of the net from close range."
11',action,"Simeone battles well with Bonucci on the left-hand side of the Juventus box and does wonderfully well to out-muscle the defender. He then spins quickly and finds Lucas Ocampos, but the latter is unable to skip past Dani Alves."
9',action,"Diego Laxalt picks up the ball midway inside the Juventus half of the pitch over on the left wing and immediately fires a bouncing pass into the penalty area and towards Simeone, but it's slightly overhit and, despite his best efforts, the youngster is unable to meet the ball in front of goal."
8',action,"Chance for Juan Cuadrado! Lichtsteiner bursts down the right flank on a great run before floating an even better cross into the middle of the penalty area. It finds Cuadrado, who does well to rise high above his marker, but his effort on goal is well saved by Mattia Perin."
6',action,"Juventus immediately push forward from the restart and move the ball around nicely as they attempt to find a way back into the game, but Hernanes brings a promising attacking move to a disappointing end with an audacious long-range effort that sails high and wide of the goal."
3',goal,"Goal Giovanni Pablo Simeone. GOAL! What a start by Genoa! A terrible mistake by Leonardo Bonucci allows Luca Rigoni to fly into the Juventus penalty area on a great run. He unleashes a low shot that Buffon does well to save, and Ocampos' follow-up is then blocked on the line by Alves. The ball bounces out to Simeone, however, and after seeing his first attempt saved well by Gianluigi Buffon, he finally pokes the ball past the veteran goalkeeper and into the back of the net."
2',action,"Benatia bursts into the Genoa half of the pitch before being tripped from behind by Simeone, and Juventus are awarded the first free-kick of the game. It's sent short and worked over quickly as they try to break forward on their first attacking move of the game, but they're unable to do so and are forced into working the ball back into their own half of the pitch."
1',action,"And we're off! Genoa get us underway, attacking from right to left."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."
,action,"Meanwhile, Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri has made three alterations to the team that featured in the 3-1 victory against Sevilla during the week, with Daniele Rugani, Patrice Evra and Claudio Marchisio making way for Stephan Lichtsteiner, Mehdi Benatia and Hernanes as they revert to their favoured 3-5-2 formation."
,action,"Ivan Juric has decided to make four changes to the Genoa side that started the 3-1 defeat away to Lazio last weekend, with Ezequiel Munoz, Darko Lazovic, Isaac Cofie and Giovanni Simeone coming into the starting line-up to replace Lucas Orban, Edenilson, Miguel Veloso and Leonardo Pavoletti, respectively."
,action,"Juventus substitutes: Chiellini, Marchisio, Higuain, Asamoah, Rugani, Neto, Sturaro, Audero, Evra, Kean."
,action,"Juventus XI (3-5-2): Buffon; Lichtsteiner, Bonucci, Benatia; Alves, Khedira, Hernanes, Pjanic, Sandro; Cuadrado, Mandzukic."
,action,"Genoa substitutes: Edenilson, Gintiletti, Ntcham, Gakpe, Biraschi, Lamanna, Pandev, Fiamozzi, Zima, Ninkovic."

,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"Despite enjoying an impressive run of form at home, it’s been a tough month for Genoa, leaving their manager under pressure and in need of a positive result. The win against Milan was the only one from their previous six Serie A games, leaving them in 12th place in the table and with just one point from their last three outings."
,action,"Genoa are yet to lose a single game at the Luigi Ferraris this season, with both Napoli and Milan failing to get the better of the Rossoblu on their visits there. The latter were stunned in a 3-0 defeat at the hands of Ivan Juric’s men, indicating that this afternoon’s game could be far tougher for Juventus than many are predicting."
,action,"The aforementioned defeats against the two Milan clubs hinted at possible problems for Massimiliano Allegri’s side, but they managed to bounce back well and head south to Liguria with four wins from as many league games. Struggling Pescara were easily beaten 3-0 last weekend, whilst a hard-fought 3-1 victory against Sevilla on Tuesday helped book their place in the last-16 of the Champions League."
,action,"Defeats against both Inter and Milan have shown that Juventus’ defence of their Serie A crown might not be as straight forward this season as they were expecting, and the Rossoneri’s thumping win against Empoli last night means that just four points separate the two sides heading into this afternoon’s clash."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Serie A game between Genoa and Juventus at the Stadio Comunale Luigi Ferraris.
