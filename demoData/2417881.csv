,action,"The FA Cup holders are out of the competition as Chelsea progress to the semi-finals and book themselves a place at Wembley. Ander Herrera's first-half sending off gave United a huge task and they never really looked like coming out of the match with a positive result. Antonio Conte's men march on in search of a double, while Jose Mourinho's only realistic chance of silverware this term is now the Europa League."
90'+5',action,FULL-TIME!
90'+4',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Diego Da Silva Costa sub-in Michy Batshuayi Tunga . Final Chelsea change now, as Batshuayi is put on for Costa."
90'+3',action,"SAVE! Chelsea catch United on the break and Fabregas is teed up on the edge of the box. He drills the ball towards goal, but De Gea palms it away. Hazard sets up for a second bite, only for Rojo to lunge in and block"
90'+1',action,"Good play by Rashford, as he runs at Azpilicueta and gets in behind him with a clever touch. His low delivery is blocked in the box by Cahill, though."
90',action,"United finally look to be pushing men forward, but they've surely left it too late, as Fellaini heads the ball on to Pogba and a weary first touch puts the ball behind for a goal-kick. The Frenchman has been so poor today."
89',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Victor Moses sub-in Kurt Zouma . Moses makes way for the final few minutes, with Zouma on in his place."
87',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Diego Da Silva Costa. The yellow card makes another appearance, this time for Costa, who goes in hard on Jones after the ball had gone. A blatant booking."
85',action,"Good block by Valencia. Chelsea get into the left side of the box and have United on the ropes, with Hazard sliding a low ball into the danger zone. But the Ecuadorian is there to put it behind."
83',action,"That was surely his moment! Lingard does well to stab the ball towards the edge of the area, but Pogba scuffs a left-footed effort wide from 20 yards. So poor."
81',substitution,Substitution sub-out Ashley Young sub-in Jesse Lingard . Young has run his race and is replaced by Lingard.
81',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Willian Borges da Silva sub-in Francesc Fàbregas i Soler . First change for Chelsea now, as Willian is withdrawn for Fabregas."
79',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ashley Young. Out comes the yellow card, with Young the one penalised for taking Moses down in cynical fashion from behind."
78',action,"The corner comes to nothing, but Chelsea stay on the front foot. Valencia is then lucky to avoid booking for wild tackle on Kante."
77',action,"That's poor from United. Young heads the ball back to De Gea, but the Spaniard refuses to dive for it with it a little off-target and they concede a corner."
76',action,"United escape! Willian does really well to beat Rojo to the ball and skip past him with a fine first touch. He then fires a teasing ball into the danger zone, but Costa can't get enough on it."
74',action,"That's a hefty tackle from Valencia, as he scythes down Hazard after he'd cut inside. The right-back escapes a booking, though."
72',action,"The corner is dealt with by United, as it flicks off Rojo and goes clear on the left. Moses darts back in and skips past one tackle, before Jones halts him. A third corner is won, but it comes to nothing."
70',action,"Excellent play by Kante, as he skips beyond Fellaini on the right and clips a cross into the box. Costa is lurking, but Jones gets there to head behind for a corner."
67',action,"Costa is displaying some amateur dramatics again. He latches on to a pass before being called offside, and then he crumples to the floor in dramatic style after Rojo bumped into him. The referee isn't having any of it and tells him to get up."
65',action,"Fine tackle! Pogba doesn't do well on the edge of the box, as he makes a feeble attempt to halt Costa. But Rojo slides in and steals the ball back in expert fashion."
63',action,"CLOSE! Good play by Chelsea, as they work the ball well across the edge of the box. Eventually Kante shapes to shoot and passes to Willian, whose first-time curling effort goes agonisingly wide of the top-right corner."
61',action,"United are now caught on the break. Kante surges forward and plays Matic in to the left side of the box. He clips the ball to the back post, but Willian's effort is blocked by Rojo. Costa then heads a great chance wide from the resulting corner."
59',action,"ALMOST! Brilliant from Rashford. The forward latches on to a hopeful ball up and beats Cahill to it. He then runs at the defender and turns him inside-out, before seeing a left-footed effort saved by Courtois. Great play, but he should have scored."
57',action,"Mourinho needs to change things now. United haven't looked like worrying Chelsea in the slightest since Herrera's dismissal and, as it stands, the holders are heading out of the FA Cup."
55',action,"Respite for United now, as Willian miscontrols the ball near the corner and concedes a goal-kick."
53',action,"United attempt to get themselves an immediate response, but a free-kick comes to nothing as Fellaini is penalised for pushing."
51',assist,"Assist Willian Borges da Silva. A pretty simple assist from Willian, but he showed good awareness to pick the Frenchman out on the edge of the box. It was all Kante from there, though."
51',goal,"Goal N'Golo Kanté. GOAL!!! UNITED'S RESISTANCE IS BROKEN! Chelsea's build-up play is patient, as they work the ball around the edge of the penalty area and Kante fires into the bottom-left corner from 25 yards."
50',action,"Good delivery by Azpilicueta, as he crosses from a deep position and looks for Costa, but Jones tracks him and gets a block on the ball, before Rojo clears his lines."
48',action,"That was dire. Young stands over the free-kick and attempts to clip it into the box, but it doesn't even get past the area's perimeter. What a waste."
47',action,"Early free-kick to United, as Pogba and Azpilicueta battle away and a foul could have been given either way to be honest. It goes the way of the visitors, though."
46',action,Off we go for the second half at Stamford Bridge.
,action,"The referee brings things to a close at Stamford Bridge with the score level, but Chelsea have themselves a numerical advantage in terms of players on the pitch after Herrera's sending off. That moment has certainly changed the flow of the match, with United now far more concerned about sitting back and defending in numbers. It's going to be a long second half for them."
45'+2',action,HALF-TIME!
45',action,There will be two minutes added on here.
43',action,"Rashford is hauled down by Cahill, who just grabs him and pulls him over while slipping to the floor. Mourinho, who was just involved in a bit of a touchline spat with Conte, is having words with the fourth official again, adamant that a yellow card should've been shown then."
41',action,"A period of Chelsea pressure ends with Moses getting a shot away from 20 yards, though it sails well over."
40',action,"And so starts the Chelsea onslaught. United have everyone, including Rashford, back in their own defensive third and the hosts are pushing everyone forward."
38',action,"Willian takes the free-kick and it is swiftly punched out by De Gea. The goalkeeper is left in a heap on the ground by Costa, who caught him in the groin with an elbow. That was nasty from the striker."
37',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Henrikh Mkhitaryan sub-in Marouane Fellaini-Bakkioui . On comes agent Fellaini, as he replaces Mkhitaryan in midfield."
35',yellow-red,"Yellow/Red Ander Herrera Agüera. RED CARD! Just moments after the restart following a foul on Hazard, Herrera trips him and gets a second booking. The first was harsh, but he was perhaps naive to produce that tackle having already picked up a yellow card."
34',action,"Jones escapes a booking there, as he goes in heavily on Hazard from behind. The referee gives him a long talking to."
32',action,"Chelsea get themselves a throw-in in a good position on the right now, as Young tackles Moses. It comes to nothing, though, with United easing the pressure for a few moments."
30',action,"Hazard keeps popping up in good positions for Chelsea, this time latching on to the ball after Jones tackled Alonso. He darts into the left side of the box before lashing high and wide of the goal."
28',action,"That's poor again from Rashford. He isolates Luiz out on the right flank, but instead of taking him on he puts a low cross into the box and Courtois gobbles it up with ease."
27',action,"Excellent tackle from Pogba! Hazard was threatening to open up the United defence again, but the Frenchman slides in from behind and cleanly took the ball."
26',action,"For all their decent play and excellent pressing, United's final pass has been very poor so far, while Rashford's hold-up play hasn't offered anything."
24',action,"United are back on the front foot. Young initially loses it out wide, but they keep the pressure on and Valencia is soon released up the right flank by Herrera. The right-back crosses, but again Young's touch is too heavy and Chelsea escape."
22',action,"United's pressing from the front really has been very good so far, particularly from Mkhitaryan and Rashford, both of whom win tackles in quick succession. How long will they be able to keep that up for, though?"
20',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ander Herrera Agüera. Excellent defending by Valencia. Chelsea work the ball into the United box for Costa, but the right-back stands up to the striker and shrugs him off. Play is then brought to a halt as Hazard is down after colliding with Herrera, who gets booked. A little harsh it has to be said - the Belgian ran into him!"
19',action,"Two more Chelsea corners come in quick succession, and eventually United get some respite, as Costa heads the second set-piece over under pressure from Rojo and Darmian."
17',action,"De Gea again! Rojo finds himself in trouble at the corner and has to desperately throw himself at Cahill. He may put him off, but the England man gets a shot away and forces another excellent stop from the Spanish goalkeeper."
16',action,"Brilliant play! Hazard does sensationally well, with his first touch leaving Smalling for dead. He then darts into the box, skipping past another tackle and forcing De Gea into a marvellous save. Corner to Chelsea."
15',action,"Luiz takes the free-kick short to Willian, but the Brazilian is swiftly halted by a fine sliding tackle by Pogba."
14',action,"United are caught napping for a moment and Chelsea play through the lines, with Willian picking up possession. He darts across towards the left, taking Darmian with him and eventually wins a free-kick, with the Italian sliding in from behind. He's lucky not to get a booking there."
12',action,"Close! Good play by United, as Rashford is released over the top by Pogba. He initially loses the ball, but manages to prod it into the path of Mkhitaryan, who gets a left-footed shot away and fires just wide of the bottom-right corner."
10',action,"Audacious from Moses, as he intercepts a Valencia pass just inside the Chelsea half and hits a first-time pass over the defence for Hazard, but it ends up going all the way through to De Gea."
9',action,Pogba tries to play the tricky ball as opposed to a simple one and gives the ball away. Chelsea work it forward quickly and then Darmian trips Hazard. Free-kick just inside the United half.
8',action,"United's pressing has been excellent so far, with Kante the one halted this time by Jones inside the Chelsea half. The England international appears to be both playing at the back and in midfield."
6',action,"Naughty from Costa, as he catches Herrera very late and barges him over. Perhaps the referee has given him the benefit of the doubt early on, but he's lucky to avoid a booking there."
4',action,"Chelsea have their first attack of the match and United defend it well. Willian tries his luck on the right, but they are forced to play their way back across the area to the left, where Valencia deals with Hazard and gets a goal-kick."
2',action,"Herrera's corner deliver is a decent one and Rojo manages to get his head to it, but he nods the ball over the crossbar. A good start by the visitors."
1',action,"Encouraging play by United right from the start, as Rashford and Valencia link up and the Ecuadorian gets a cross in. Luiz slices his clearance away and then from the resulting throw-in United get themselves a corner."
1',action,Off we go! Chelsea get things started.
,action,The players are out and the match is just moments away from starting at Stamford Bridge.
,action,"In fact, that victory in October extended Chelsea's impressive run against United, with the Londoners now 11 unbeaten against them in all competitions, a run which stretches back to October 2012."
,action,"No one will need reminding of the importance of this match, with a place in the FA Cup semi-finals and a trip to Wembley at stake. Of course there is also the extra plot involving Mourinho's latest return to his former club and he will be desperate for his men to produce a better showing than on their visit in October, when the hosts ran out 4-0 winners."
,action,"Marcus Rashford was initially thought to be missing as well, with the youngster suffering from an illness. But he has been passed fit and he starts between Ashley Young and Henrikh Mkhitaryan in attack. The England international hasn't had many opportunities in a central role this term, so he will no doubt be eager to impress."
,action,"While Chelsea's preparations went nice and smoothly, United have had no such luck. Their issues have been dominated by striker woes, with the suspended Zlatan Ibrahimovic joining Wayne Rooney and Anthony Martial in missing the game."
,action,"As you can see, Antonio Conte has sprung few surprises in his team, arguably going with his strongest possible line-up for United's visit. N'Golo Kante and Nemanja Matic are the midfield pairing, meaning Cesc Fabregas must once again be content with a spot on the bench, while it is Willian rather than Pedro who will link up with Diego Costa and Eden Hazard."
