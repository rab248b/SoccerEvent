,action,"That's all from us here at the bet365 Stadium, thanks for joining us and we hope you can join us again soon."
,action,Joe Allen’s second half goal secures all three points for Stoke here at the bet365 Stadium and ensures Palace remain inside the relegation zone.
,action,Full-time: Stoke City 1-0 Crystal Palace
90'+5',action,Afellay does really well to win his side a corner which Arnautovic and Diouf will look to just keep in the corner.
90'+4',action,Palace are throwing numbers forward here but they are really struggling to get the ball anywhere near Grant’s goal and Stoke look extremely well organised at the back.
90'+1',action,"The fourth official holds up the board to signal six minutes of added time, much to the displeasure of Mark Hughes."
90',action,"Palace win a free-kick in a good area 25 yards out from goal after a clumsy foul on Benteke by Pieters. Townsend goes for goal from the free-kick but gets it horribly wrong, blasting the ball high into the stands."
87',substitution,Substitution sub-out James McArthur sub-in Loïc Rémy . A final roll of the dice now from Sam Allardyce as he brings on Loic Remy to replace McArthur.
86',action,Palace may be trailing but its Stoke who look the more likely to score here and Palace are still struggling to create any real chances.
84',action,"Afellay plays lovely one-two with Arnautovic which very nearly sets him clean through on goal, but Hennessey reacts really well to come off his line quickly and dive on top of the ball."
82',substitution,Substitution sub-out Ramadan Sobhi sub-in Mame Biram Diouf . Another change for Stoke now as the impressive Ramadan is replaced by sub-in Mame Biram Diouf.
81',action,Benteke pulls down Shawcross as he looks to get to a high ball ahead of the centre-half and referee Atkinson penalises him for the challenge. That was certainly a challenge made out of frustration from the Belgian.
79',substitution,Substitution sub-out Charlie Adam sub-in Ibrahim Afellay . Mark Hughes is making another change now as Adam is replaced by sub-in Ibrahim Afellay.
77',substitution,Substitution sub-out Jason Puncheon sub-in Yohan Cabaye . Another change for Palace now as sub-in Yohan Cabaye comes on to replace Puncheon in midfield.
74',action,Concern for Stoke now as Arnautovic and Adam are both down having collided with each other. It would be a big loss for Mark Hughes to lose either of them but it looks as though they’re both going to be able to continue.
72',action,"Big chance for Tomkins!! Puncheon flicks on a header from McArthur’s cross towards an unmarked Tomkins at the back post, but the centre-half rushes the chance and blasts a first-time volley high into the crowd from eight yards out."
70',action,"Martins Indi gives a cheap corner away as Palace look to hit back straight away, but Adam does well to climb highest and head Townsend’s cross out of play for a throw-in."
68',substitution,Substitution sub-out Wilfried Zaha sub-in Jeffrey Schlupp . Palace have reacted immediately to that goal by bringing on sub-in Jeffrey Schlupp in place of Zaha.
67',assist,Assist Ramadan Sobhi. The control and hold up play from Ramadan was outstanding there having been picked out by Arnautovic.
67',goal,"Goal Joe Allen. GOOOAAALLLLLL!!! Allen gives Stoke the lead! Arnautovic picks out Ramadan with a superb ball over the top and the Egyptian holds the ball up really well inside the Palace penalty box, before laying the ball into the path of Allen who side foots the ball into the bottom corner from 12 yards out."
65',action,"Townsend does really well to force Johnson into playing the ball out for a corner, but the winger chooses to take the set piece quickly but Ramadan gets back superbly well and shepherds the ball out of play for a goal kick. That will really frustrate Sam Allardyce as Palace have looked dangerous from corners."
62',action,Martins Indi is back on the pitch as Stoke enjoy a good spell of possession now. Those stoppages seem to have just halted the momentum Palace were starting to build.
60',action,Martins Indi is now down for Stoke and the home crowd aren’t happy that Palace didn’t put the ball out of play immediately. It looks as though Benteke just caught the centre-back in the face with a trailing arm as the pair battled for the ball.
58',substitution,Substitution sub-out Phil Bardsley sub-in Glen Johnson . The right-back isn’t going to be able to continue here and sub-in Glen Johnson comes on in his place.
57',action,Bardsley is down receiving some treatment to now for what appears to be an injury to his lower leg.
55',action,"Having started the half on the back foot Palace have started to get a foothold in this game in the last five minutes, with Townsend looking a particular threat down the left-hand touchline."
53',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ryan Shawcross. Shawcross goes into the book for a foul on Townsend on the left-hand edge of the penalty box. The winger picks himself up to roll the free-kick short to Puncheon who’s low shot breaks to Benteke eight yards out from goal, but his control lets him down and he can’t get a shot away."
52',action,"Benteke turns Shawcross really well just inside the Stoke half but once again he lacks support and he gives possession away cheaply, epitomising the problems the striker has faced as the lone striker today."
49',action,"Townsend whips in a superb cross from the free-kick towards Benteke in the middle of the area, but the ball somehow evades everyone and goes out of play for a throw-in on the far side."
48',action,Zaha does really well to flick the ball past Pieters before drawing the foul from the left-back in a dangerous area close to the right-hand corner flag.
46',action,"A really bright start to the second half here for Stoke as Allen drives down the right-hand side of the Palace penalty area, but his touch is too heavy and goes straight out for a goal kick. Mark Hughes will be delighted with his side’s start to the second half here though."
46',action,Kick-off! Whelan rolls the ball backwards to get the second half underway.
,action,"Mark Hughes will be slightly frustrated by his side’s lack of creativity in the first-half, and may well turn to Saido Berahino or Ibrahim Afellay early in the second half in an attempt to unlock the resolute Palace defence. Sam Allardyce meanwhile will be asking his midfield to get forwards more often to support Benteke, who has looked an isolated figure at times."
,action,"Stoke have had the better of the chances in the first half here and could’ve taken the lead moments before the break, only for Townsend to clear Martins Indi’s header off the line. Palace have showed glimpses of their own attacking threat though, and have been well organised in defence for the majority of the half."
,action,Half-time: Stoke City 0-0 Crystal Palace
45',action,"Benteke very nearly played clean through by McArthur after a poor header from Martins Indi, but the midfielder’s pass is just too heavy and Shawcross is able to get across and make a superb sliding tackle on the Belgian striker."
44',action,"OFF THE LINE!! Adam swings in a corner from the left and Martins Indi directs a powerful header towards the back post, but Townsend gets back onto the line extremely well to stick out his right leg and prevent the ball crossing the line!"
42',yellow-card,Yellow Card Jason Puncheon. Things just becoming a little bit scrappy now as Puncheon joins Zaha in the book for a trip on Pieters. Adam floats in the resultant free-kick but Palace are able to head away the danger with ease.
40',yellow-card,Yellow Card Wilfried Zaha. Zaha brings down Bardsley close to halfway and is shown a yellow card by referee Atkinson. You feel that challenge may well have been a bit of revenge for the push a few moments ago.
38',action,"Very nearly a disaster at the back for Palace as Allen whips in a superb cross from the left and all the Palace defenders leave it for each other allowing Crouch to attack it unopposed, but Hennessey reacts well to gather the ball in just ahead of the Stoke striker."
36',action,Zaha screams at referee Martin Atkinson after Phil Bardsley pushes him to the ground once the ball had gone out of play. Palace assistant Sammy Lee doesn’t look too pleased with that either and it did appear a little unnecessary from the Stoke right-back.
35',action,"Another half chance for Arnautovic as Allen breaks towards the Palace penalty box and lays the ball off towards the Austrian, but the ball is just behind him as he shoots from the edge of the box and he’s unable to the generate the power required to beat Hennessey, who picks up the tame effort with ease."
32',action,"CHANCE!! Wonderful run from Ramadan down the left as he skips past Ward with ease before picking out Allen who’s unmarked at the back post, but the Welshman just can’t get over the ball and can only head over the bar from five yards out."
30',action,Crouch and Arnautovic are switching positions regularly here allowing Crouch to get up against van Aanholt and Arnautovic to make good runs in behind.
29',action,The home crowd are just starting to show one or two signs of frustration now as Crouch passes the ball straight out for a throw-in. Things just aren’t quite clicking for Stoke here against a very well organised Palace defence.
26',action,"Van Aanholt with the first half chance of the game for Palace now as he drives a low left-footed effort towards goal from the left-hand corner of the box, but Grant does well to get down and hold on to the shot with Townsend closing in on the rebound."
25',action,Mark Hughes just showing one or two signs of frustration on the edge of his technical area now as Joe Allen’s long ball forwards goes straight out for a goal kick.
23',action,"Crouch once again gets up well at the far post, this time climbing above van Aanholt following a high hanging cross from Ramadan, but again he can’t get his header on target and Hennessey watches it bounce wide of his right-hand upright."
21',action,Charlie Adam swings in a dangerous corner from the right and Crouch gets up above two Palace defenders at the back post but can only fire his header across the face of goal and out for a goal kick. The big centre-forward has looked a threat so far today though.
19',action,"Stoke are going to have to be patient here as Palace are defending in numbers, dropping into what is essentially a 4-5-1 when they don’t have the ball."
17',action,"Andros Townsend is picked out by Zaha on the left and whips in a superb ball towards McArthur at the near post, but the midfielder can’t direct his header on target from 8 yards out and Grant watches it go wide of his near post."
16',yellow-card,Yellow Card Damien Delaney. Damien Delaney is shown the first yellow card of the game for a foul on Ramadan.
14',action,"Wilfried Zaha throws his arms in the air as Jason Puncheon chooses to ignore him and take on Bruno Martins Indi himself, but the centre-back does well to stand his ground and make the tackle."
11',action,"James Tomkins floats a long free-kick in towards Christian Benteke in the Stoke area, but Crouch does his defensive duties well as he heads the ball clear before James McArthur fires an ambitious long-range effort well wide of Lee Grant’s goal."
9',action,"Save! The first chance of the game falls to Stoke as Crouch gets up well to flick a header into the path of Arnautovic, who cuts inside onto his left foot and fires a fierce effort towards goal from 15 yards out, but Hennessey springs to his right to palm it away from danger."
7',action,Glenn Whelan this time tries to pick out Ramadan with another long cross-field pass but once again Ward intercepts it and nods the ball back to Wayne Hennessey. Neither side have really stamped their authority on this game yet.
5',action,Joe Allen and Peter Crouch link up well close to halfway before Marko Arnautovic’s attempted cross-field pass towards Ramadan Sobhi is well intercepted by Joel Ward. Stoke are certainly looking to get the ball wide here as often as possible.
3',action,Stoke have settled into this game quickly here and are seeing plenty of the ball but Palace look well organised at the back in the early stages.
1',action,Kick-off! Palace get the game underway.
,action,"The players are making their way out onto the pitch, kick-off is not far away now."
,action,"Crystal Palace came out on top when the two sides last met in September, with goals from Scott Dann and James Tomkins helping them to a 4-1 win over a Stoke side who were bottom of the table at the time."
,action,"Crystal Palace boss Sam Allardyce makes two changes from the side that lost to Sunderland, with Luka Milivojevic coming into midfield for his debut in place of Yohan Cabaye, while Andros Townsend replaces Scott Dann in a switch which sees Palace revert back to a four man defence."
,action,"Mark Hughes makes just one change to his Stoke side that were beaten by West Brom, with Ramadan Sobhi replacing Ibrahim Afellay having returned from international duty with Egypt at the Africa Cup of Nations."
