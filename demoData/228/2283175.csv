,action,"They weren't presented with too many chances in advanced areas but did well to take advantage of each and every one, with Joselu and Bergantinos both converted opportunities to deal Barcelona a serious dent to their chances of lifting the title once again. The victory also means that they now sit eight points clear of the relegation zone in 15th place."
,action,"What a win for Deportivo! Their players collapse on the floor with delight as the referee's whistle is blown for the final time, and it's no wonder why. They really were excellent from start to finish this afternoon, and they leave with a well-deserved, and incredibly important, win against a Barcelona side that struggled to find a way through a resolute defensive line."
,action,FULL-TIME: DEPORTIVO LA CORUNA 2-1 BARCELONA
90'+4',action,"What an opportunity for Fajr to wrap up the win! After dealing with a dangerous, curling cross, Deportivo break away on a blisteringly quick counter-attack. Fajr is completely unmarked inside the Barcelona half of the pitch and only has Ter Stegen to beat, but he fires his shot straight into the body of the German."
90'+3',action,"Barcelona are presented with two chances to find a late, late equaliser, but the Deportivo defenders do fantastically well to deal with the danger on both occasions. They're now mere seconds away from picking up a huge victory!"
90'+2',action,"Big chance for Messi, but he doesn't take it! Fajr clumsy clatters into the back of Suarez and sends the striker crashing to the ground just outside of the Deportivo penalty area. Messi then steps up and shoots, but his curling strike is poor and sails comfortably over the top of the crossbar."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be three minutes of added time. Can Barcelona find a last-gasp equaliser?
89',action,"Rakitic charges down the right flank before trying to fire a cross into the box, but Navarro is there to deflect it out for a corner. Barcelona are unable to make it count though, as, once again, Deportivo defend the set-piece brilliantly."
88',action,"Poor play by Joselu! The striker is presented with a great opportunity to test Ter Stegen after breaking away by himself down the left flank, but he's put under pressure by Busquets inside the penalty area and ends up running the ball of play. He really should have done better there!"
86',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Juan Francisco Moreno Fuertes sub-in Laureano Sanabria Ruiz . Deportivo have made a late change, with Laure coming on to take the place of Juanfran."
84',action,"A lovely chipped pass from Iniesta flies into the heart of the Deportivo box and into the path of Roberto, who is in a great position in front of goal, but he can't make decent contact with the ball and ends up kneeing it over the top of the crossbar from close range."
82',action,"Deportivo go close to making it 3-1! An awful attempted clearance from Ter Stegen sends the ball straight to Kakuta, who then pokes a pass up to Colak, but the attacking midfielder doesn't have his shooting boots on and is unable to strike from inside the penalty area."
80',action,"What a save by Lux! A beautiful Barcelona move looks set to result in a goal for the league leaders, but, somehow, Suarez's close-range shot is wonderfully saved by the feet of the Deportivo goalkeeper."
79',action,"A dangerous Alba cross sails into the Deportivo penalty area and almost finds Alcacer at the far post, but Navarro does really well to rise high above the Uruguayan before nodding the ball behind for a corner."
77',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Denis Suárez Fernández sub-in Francisco Alcácer García . Barcelona have made a late, and attacking, change, with Denis Suarez making way for Paco Alcacer."
76',action,"Barcelona look really rattled after going behind once again. They're trying their hardest to find another equaliser, but Deportivo have plenty of bodies back and are easily dealing with everything that's thrown at them."
74',goal,"Goal Alejandro Bergantiños García. GOAL! Deportivo are back in front! A second corner for Deportivo curls right on to the head of Bergantinos, who easily rises high above Alba before beating Ter Stegen with an excellent header into the bottom right-hand corner of the net."
74',assist,Assist Emre Çolak. Assist Emre Çolak
73',action,"Fingertip save by Ter Stegen! The home side push forward once again after another Barcelona attack breaks down and do well to win themselves a corner. It's curled into the penalty area and right on to the head of Arribas, but the defender's downward header is pushed on to the post by a diving save from the German."
72',action,"Deportivo immediately push forward on a rare attack from the restart and work the ball up to Colak, who has seen little of it since coming on to the pitch. He's unable to make his time in possession count, however, as he scuffs a 25-yard well wide of the goal."
71',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Bruno Alexandre Vilela Gama sub-in Gaël Kakuta . Deportivo have made their second substitution of the afternoon, with Gama making way for Gael Kakuta."
70',action,"Denis Suarez twists and turns over on the left-hand side of the Deportivo penalty area before trying to set up Luis Suarez at the far post, but it's a very poor delivery from the number six and it sails harmlessly out of play for a goal-kick."
68',action,"Barcelona move the ball around quickly deep inside the Deportivo half of the pitch before Alba tries to send a clever through-ball into the path of Luis Suarez, but Borges is there to cut out the danger with an outstretched foot at the vital moment."
66',action,"Luis Suarez cuts inside from deep down the left flank and pokes a clever pass back to Iniesta. The midfielder is in a pocket of space on the edge of the Deportivo penalty area and has an opportunity to shoot, but he instead tries to dummy it to Messi. Unfortunately for him, the Argentine isn't expecting the ball and Deportivo easily clear the danger."
64',action,"Excellent strike by Joselu! Gama picks up the ball over on the right flank and immediately kick-starts a quick counter-attack. He charges forward before chipping a cross over to Joselu, who, from the edge of the box, fires a lovely shot into the hands of Ter Stegen at the near post."
62',substitution,Substitution sub-out Carles Gil de Pareja Vicent sub-in Emre Çolak . Gil receives a rousing round of applause from the home fans as he's replaced by Emre Colak in Deportivo's first change of the afternoon.
60',action,"Iniesta and Rakitic immediately link up inside the Deportivo penalty area thanks to a clever pass from the former to the latter, but the Croatian midfielder is slightly offside and the linesman's flag is raised just as he's about to spin and shoot."
58',substitution,"Substitution sub-out André Filipe Tavares Gomes sub-in Ivan Rakitić . And the second is Ivan Rakitic, who replaces Gomes."
58',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Arda Turan sub-in Andrés Iniesta Luján . Barcelona have decided to make a double substitution. The first player to come on is Andres Iniesta, who takes the place of Turan."
57',action,"Great chance for Messi! The Argentine, who hasn't been at his best today, is set up on the edge of the Deportivo penalty area and immediately unleashes a thumping strike, but it isn't hit quite well enough and curls a few yards wide of the near post."
56',action,"Deportivo are really enjoying themselves inside the Barcelona half of the pitch at the moment. They win themselves a corner over on the left wing which is played short to Fajr, and he then swings a cross into the box that's well defended by the visiting side."
54',action,"Fajr goes close again! Joselu flies through the disjointed Barcelona back line and latches on to a clever pass down the right wing. He then curls a low cross into the penalty area and over to Fajr, who is quickly closed down by Roberto and is unable to test Ter Stegen with his thumping strike."
52',action,"Deportivo move the ball around really nicely as they string together a good series of passes. Juanfran then curls a deep cross into the Barcelona box and over to the far post, where it finds Fajr. The Moroccan does well to keep the ball in play but can't direct towards a team-mate, and the visitors are able to hold on."
50',action,"Barcelona pile plenty of bodies forward as they try to find a way in front, but they're unable to do so and Deportivo win back possession once again. Fajr then flies forward on a positive run but has it brought to an end by Mascherano, who sends him crashing to the ground with a hefty challenge."
48',action,"Penalty shouts from Deportivo! Gil darts towards the Barcelona penalty area on a dangerous run before going down after tangling with Busquets, but he delays falling to the ground and has his protests waved away by the referee."
46',goal,"Goal Luis Alberto Suárez Díaz. GOAL! Barcelona have equalised! What a start to the second half by the visitors! Denis Suarez gets himself into a good position deep down the right wing before firing a low cross into the heart of the penalty area. It bounces off Arribas and out to Luis Suarez, who then fires a thumping strike past Lux and into the bottom right-hand corner of the net."
46',action,We're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"It's been a great opening 45 minutes for Deportivo, who have really impressed at both ends of the pitch to frustrate a tired and lacklustre Barcelona side. The visitors have dominated possession but have struggled inside the final third of the pitch, with Messi and Luis Suarez largely failing to cause their opponents too many problems. At the other end, Deportivo have created little but took advantage of a Ter Stegen mistake to give themselves a well-deserved one-goal lead heading into the break."
,action,HALF-TIME: DEPORTIVO LA CORUNA 1-0 BARCELONA
45',action,"Another attempted Barcelona attacking move fails to have the speed and intensity needed to test Deportivo, who are easily able to sit deep and soak up the pressure before breaking down the left wing through Gil. Barcelona need to come up with some new ways to try and test this resolute defence."
44',action,"Barcelona keep piling bodies forward as they desperately try to find a way back into the game, but they're unable to find a way through the sea of Deportivo players camped in front of them. The home side have defended really well so far, and they certainly deserve to be in front."
42',action,"Gerard Pique almost equalises! Barcelona immediately push forward from the restart and win themselves a corner over on the left wing. It's curled towards the far post and finds Pique, who brings the ball down beautiful, but he's unable to find the back of the net with his thumping half-volley from close range."
40',goal,"Goal José Luis Sanmartín Mato. GOAL! What a howler by Ter Stegen! Seconds after making a great save to deny Joselu, the goalkeeper spills a poor attempted clearance from Mascherano into the path of Joselu, who then thumps the ball into the back of the net from close range."
39',action,"Great save by Ter Stegen! A swinging cross curls into the Barcelona penalty area and finds Joselu. The striker immediately unleashes a low shot that looks set for the bottom right-hand corner of the net, but Ter Stegen is there to push it round the post and out for a corner."
38',action,"Luis Suarez breaks into the Deportivo on another positive run forward, but, as has been the case for most of the game so far, he's unable to latch on to a chipped pass forward from Alba and loses out to a group of blue and white shirts inside the box."
36',yellow-card,"Yellow Card José Luis Sanmartín Mato. Deportivo are unable to fully clear the danger and Barcelona burst forward once again, but a poor attempted tackle from Joselu on Javier Mascherano results in a free-kick for the visitors and a yellow card for the striker."
35',action,"What a chance for Roberto! The midfielder breaks through the Deportivo back line and latches on to a lovely pass from Sergio Busquets inside the penalty area. He then heads towards the byline before trying to set up Luis Suarez, but Lux sticks out an arm to deny him from doing so."
34',action,"Deportivo are presented with a rare opportunity to push forward, but they're unable to hold on to the ball for long and quickly lose it on the halfway line. A lofted pass is then thumped down the right wing and into the path of Luis Suarez, but his run forward is slightly mistimed and results in the linesman's flag being raised."
32',action,"Barcelona are continuing to dominate possession but are struggling to do much with it inside the final third of the pitch. This time it's Turan who picks up the ball over on the left wing and fires a cross into the box, but it fails to find Luis Suarez and is easily dealt with by the Deportivo centre-backs."
30',action,"Gomes breaks into the left-hand side of the Deportivo penalty area and skips past a sliding tackle from Juanfran. He then cuts on to his right foot and unleashes a curling shot, but it's poorly hit and sails well wide of the far post."
28',action,"Free header for Luis Suarez! A looping cross flies right on to the head of the Uruguayan, who is completely unmarked in front of goal, but he can only send his headed effort straight into the hands of Lux. He really should have buried that!"
26',action,"Almost a chance for Borges! Fajr whips a lovely cross into the heart of the Barcelona penalty area and towards Borges, but Alba is just about able to beat the Costa Rican to the ball at the vital moment. Without that touch, the midfielder would have had a great opportunity to open the scoring."
24',action,"Luis Suarez gets himself into a good position just outside of the Deportivo box, but he's unable to pick out a team-mate due to good defending by the home side. He then eventually gets a shot away, but it's poorly hit and fails to trouble German Lux."
22',action,"Luis Suarez and Messi link up really well on the edge of the Deportivo penalty area thanks to a quick one-two between the two. The Argentine then tries to side-foot a volleyed strike into the top right-hand corner of the net, but it's closed down quickly by Celso Borges."
20',action,"Denis Suarez gets himself into a really good position over on the right flank and quickly whips a low cross into the penalty area. It flies towards Luis Suarez and looks set to find the striker in front of goal, but Alejandro Arribas sticks out a foot to stop it from doing so."
18',action,"It's been a really positive opening 18 minutes for Deportivo, who are defending well and making life tough for Barcelona. Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez have struggled to find much joy so far, with the hosts' centre-backs diligently defending against them."
16',action,"Joselu is pushed to the ground by Andre Gomes, resulting in angry whistles from the home fans. Deportivo are awarded a free-kick in a promising position but they're unable to do anything with it, as Ter Stegen can easily deal with the danger."
14',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Fernando Navarro i Corbacho. Ouch! The referee's yellow card is out already, and it's Fernando Navarro who receives the first booking of the game after clattering into Roberto with a dangerous challenge."
13',action,"Juanfran gets himself into a good position deep down the right flank before firing a deflected cross into the Barcelona box. It finds Joselu in a dangerous position, but he shows slightly too much of the ball to Jordi Alba and is dispossessed before he can shoot."
11',action,"Arda Turan gets himself into a good position just outside of the Deportivo box before spinning and trying to find Luis Suarez, but the Uruguayan loses out at the vital moment. The ball then bounces out to Denis Suarez over on the right wing, but he's unable to find a team-mate with his curling cross."
9',action,"Chance for Joselu! Bruno Gama picks up the ball just inside the Barcelona half of the pitch and quickly breaks forward. He's easily able to skip past Pique before teeing up Joselu, and the striker then unleashes a low shot that's well saved by Marc-Andre ter Stegen."
7',action,"A clumsy challenge by Denis Suarez results in a free-kick for Deportivo in a promising position 30 yards away from the Barcelona goal. Faycal Fajr steps up and chips a cross into the middle of the box, but it fails to find a team-mate and is easily cleared."
5',action,"Deportivo push forward on their first attacking move of the game, but Luis Suarez is there to push the ball away from Carles Gil and out for a throw-in. The home side fail to make it count, as Barcelona have plenty of bodies back to win possession again."
3',action,"The teamsheet indicated that Barcelona were going to revert to a 4-3-3 set-up, but it looks as if they're playing with three at the back again. Denis Suarez is operating quite wide on the right wing, and it's he who breaks forward on the first good run of the game. He's unable to send a cross into the penalty area, however, and the Deportivo defence manage to deal with the danger."
1',action,"We're off! Deportivo get us underway, attacking from right to left."

,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"Barcelona have dominated this fixture in recent years, with the last two meetings proving to be particularly chastening experiences for Deportivo. Last season’s corresponding fixture saw the Blaugrana comfortably thrash their opponents 8-0 thanks to four Luis Suarez goals, whilst the meeting earlier this campaign resulted in a similarly easy 4-0 win for the league leaders."
,action,"As for Deportivo, they picked up three hugely important points thanks to a narrow win against fellow strugglers Sporting last weekend, and they followed it with a last-gasp 1-1 draw at home to Betis on Wednesday evening. Pepe Mel seems to have given the Galician side a much-needed boost since taking over from Gaizka Garitano just two weeks ago, although his team remain dangerously close to the relegation zone and must now face a side that they haven’t managed to beat since 2008."
,action,"After suffering disappointing and hard-fought draws against Villarreal and Real Betis at the start of the year, Barcelona currently find themselves on an excellent winning run in the league. All of their last six games have ended in victories, with Sporting Gijon and Celta Vigo most recently being thrashed 6-1 and 5-0, respectively. As a result, Luis Enrique’s men have scored 17 times in just three games, with only three goals being conceded during that time."
,action,"Against all odds, Barcelona remain in the Champions League thanks to Wednesday’s stunning victory at home to Paris Saint-Germain, a game that was not only one of the most spectacular seen this season but also one that has placed the Blaugrana firmly in the history books. Their attention now returns to La Liga, as their fierce battle for the title with Real Madrid and Sevilla shows no signs of abating any time soon."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s La Liga game between Deportivo La Coruna and Barcelona at the Estadio Municipal de Riazor.
