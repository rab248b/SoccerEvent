,action,"That's all from us today folks, we hope you enjoyed the game!"
,action,"Millwall have knocked the Premier League champions out and they are into the quarter-finals of the FA Cup! Cummings the hero with his late goal giving the League One side a narrow victory here at The Den, despite going down to ten-men midway through the second half."
,action,FULL-TIME: MILLWALL 1-0 LEICESTER
90'+5',action,That's the final whistle! Millwall have done it!
90'+2',action,Still a few more minutes of extra time to be played here! Leicester have a corner which Zieler is coming up for but it comes to nothing.
90',assist,"Assist Lee Gregory. Lee Gregory did very well to lay the ball into the path of his in-running right-back, who showed great composure to tuck the ball into the back of the net."
90',goal,"Goal Shaun Cummings. MILLWALL HAVE DONE IT! Shaun Cummings has scored, to surely win it for the Lions! Onyedinma crossed for Lee Gregory on the edge of the box, he then played the ball into the right-back Cummings who held his nerve to tuck the ball past Zieler. The Lions are on the brink of knocking a THIRD Premier League side out of the FA Cup!"
89',action,"A goal by either team now will surely win the game! Leicester desperately want to win this game and avoid a replay at the King Power Stadium, as they already have a busy schedule coming up."
86',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Shane Ferguson sub-in Mahlon Romeo . Final Millwall substitution here now with sub-out Shane Ferguson the man coming off, to be replaced by sub-in Mahlon Romeo."
85',action,"SAVE! Another superb stop by Archer to deny Okazaki once again! The striker tried to pull the ball across, it took a deflection and Archer had to be on his toes to make the save and get to the ball before the oncoming Vardy."
83',action,Huge appeals from the Millwall players and supporters for handball as Onyedinma's cross into the box is blocked by Benalouane. Nothing given by the referee.
80',action,"WHAT A CHANCE! How did that not go in! Leicester should've taken the lead! Okazaki has a perfect chance to give his side the lead. The right-wing cross from Albrighton was aimed at Vardy but went through to Okazaki who wasted his chance from inside the six yard box. The ball falls to him just yards from goal with just Archer to beat, but he takes far too long to take the shot! Archer capitalises and blocks the effort. Fantastic save but that should've been one-nil Leicester."
79',substitution,Substitution sub-out Aiden O'Brien sub-in Lee Gregory . Another Millwall substitution as sub-out Aiden O'Brien comes off to be replaced by striker sub-in Lee Gregory.
78',action,Millwall's turn to threaten at goal now as O'Brien heads the ball over the bar from the penalty spot. This game could still go either way.
77',action,"Half a chance for Vardy! On his weaker side, but the striker caught it well on the edge of the box. His effort going inches wide of the post, with Archer scrambling to try and get across."
75',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Calum Butcher sub-in Nadjim Abdou . Here comes the first Millwall substitution of the game, sub-out Calum Butcher is the man coming off and he is replaced by sub-in Nadjim Abdou."
73',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Demarai Gray sub-in Jamie Vardy . Third and final Leicester substitution here as sub-out Demarai Gray is replaced by sub-in Jamie Vardy, who desperately needs a goal. Vardy scored twice the last time he played Millwall, as the Foxes beat them 3-0 back in November 2013."
71',action,"Gray whips in a free-kick from wide on the left, after Chilwell was fouled by Cummings. But Archer claims it comfortably and Millwall and breathe easy again."
70',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Molla Wagué sub-in Marcin Ryszard Wasilewski . The defender is in a lot of pain and he has to come off, his replacement is Ryszard Wasilewski. Straight swap in defence."
68',action,Play is stopped at the moment as Wague is down receiving medical treatment for a shoulder injury. He looks in a lot of pain and may be heading off injured on his Foxes debut.
67',action,Millwall have been the better side since the sending off! They are really starting to rattle the Leicester players and create more and more chances.
66',action,"STAT: Millwall have progressed from their last two FA Cup ties v Leicester (round five in 1984-85 and round three in 1990-91), after losing the first two."
64',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Bartosz Kapustka sub-in Marc Albrighton . Here is the first substitution of the game, with sub-out Bartosz Kapustka coming off to be replaced by sub-in Marc Albrighton."
64',action,Shaun Williams forces Zieler into making a good save! The midfielder found plenty of time and space on the edge of the box and he unleashed a powerful strike at goal.
62',action,"Looks like we could be about to see the first substitution of the game, as Leicester look to try and make their man advantage count. Perhaps taking a more defensive player for Jamie Vardy or Marc Albrighton, who will try to stretch this compact Millwall defence."
60',action,"Another half-chance for Leicester, as Bartosz Kapustka tries his luck with an overhead kick in the box. But Archer is untroubled and sees the ball goes harmlessly wide of the Millwall goal."
58',action,"CHANCE MILLWALL! Morison does brilliantly to beat Daniel Amartey and whip a cross into the box, Shaun Cummings looks to be meeting it at the far post but Gray does very well to track him all the way back and make a good defensive clearance. The resulting corner comes to nothing."
57',action,"It's all Leicester at the moment, they are making the extra player count in possession. However Millwall are doing well to keep them away from their penalty box and restricting any chances."
55',action,"The ball comes in, Morison swings his leg at the ball but misses and Leicester break away! Gray does well before Millwall captain Tony Craig makes a good sliding challenge to halt his progress."
54',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ron-Robert Zieler. Zieler receives a yellow card for handling the ball outside the box, near the touchline."
54',action,"HANDBALL! Zieler appears to have been pushed out of the box by Onyedinma, who keeps the ball in his hands and the referee awards a free-kick for handling the ball outside of the box. Free-kick in a good position for Millwall."
52',yellow-red,"Yellow/Red Jake Cooper. COOPER IS OFF! he Lions defender is shown a second yellow for clattering Musa on the half-way line, it was a silly challenge to make so far away from the dangerzone. Cooper was booked at the end of the first-half for the goal-mouth scuffle with Zieler."
51',action,"The Lions may look towards Lee Gregory soon to try and make the difference. The striker has been struggling with an injury, but Millwall are struggling to create any chances so he may be worth a shot."
49',action,"Another shot at goal by Musa! Again from the edge of the box, it takes a slight deflection but it is straight at Archer who makes a comfortable save. Millwall need to stop allowing Musa so much time as one of these shots could quite easily punish them."
48',action,"The Leicester players were sent out nice and early for the start of this second half, Claudio Ranieri will have been wondering how is side didn't score in the first half, and allowed Millwall to grow into the game."
46',action,"Musa looks to get a shot off at goal straight from kick-off, but his effort his blocked. Leicester in possession of the ball at the start of this second half."
46',action,The second half is underway!
,action,"Leicester dominated the opening 30 minutes of the game, fashioning plenty of chances to score, with Gray and Musa looking dangerous. However Millwall grew into the game and had a couple of chances of their own as the half went on."
,action,HALF-TIME: MILLWALL 0-0 LEICESTER
45'+1',action,That's the half-time whistle!
45',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Jake Cooper. The coming together with Zieler, resulting in Cooper receiving the first yellow card of the game."
44',action,"Millwall have another corner which bounces off a couple of players before Zieler appears to gather. Jake Cooper then goes in too hard on the goalkeeper on the floor, the Leicester players didn't like that at all!"
43',action,MILLWALL CHANCE! The resulting corner is met well by Webster but his header is straight at Zieler who is able to make a comfortable save. Good stuff from the hosts at the end of this first-half.
41',action,"Strong play by Morison up front, he drags Benalouane wide and out of position and the centre-back goes in too hard on the striker and Millwall have a free-kick. The ball in is cleared out of play for a Millwall corner."
40',action,"Musa tries his luck from the edge of the box, once again the Millwall players just didn't get close enough to him and he fires a shot at goal, which is too high and goes over the bar."
37',action,"More good play from Millwall in the Leicester half, but they are still looking for their real goalscoring chance of the game. So far Ron-Robert Zieler hasn't had a single save to make in the Foxes net."
35',action,"Gray has been very lively here today, Leicester's best player. Once again he uses his pace to beat several Millwall defenders and work space in the box, however his final touch lets him down as he tries to pull the ball back across goal to Okazaki."
34',action,"10 minutes to go until half-time, can either side fashion a goal scoring chance before the break?"
33',action,"STAT: Leicester have won 11 competitive games in 2016-17 so far; over half of which have come in cup competitions (five in Premier League, four in Champions League, two in FA Cup)."
31',action,"This is much better from Millwall. Instead of trying to blast the ball upfield when they win it back, they are trying to play out from the back which is allowing them to slow the game down and give themselves so breathing space."
29',action,"CHANCE MILLWALL! This is the first chance of the game for Millwall. Onyedinma does well and finds Morison in the box, his shot is blocked, before another blocked shot which goes out for a corner. First Lions corner of the game comes to nothing."
27',action,"Great stuff from Ben Chilwell down the left and he wins a corner for the Foxes which is taken by Gray. The initial ball in is a poor one and after png-pong in the box with the ball, Millwall manage to clear."
25',action,Great atmosphere here at The Den. Millwall fans are trying their hardest to get behind their team and push them forward. Meanwhile the Foxes are also backed by a huge amount of support and they will have enjoyed what they are seen from their side so far today.
23',action,"STAT: The Foxes last progressed beyond the fifth round in 2011-12, losing to eventual winners Chelsea in the sixth round. Whilst Millwall last played in round five in 2012-13, beating non-league Luton on their way to the semi-final that season."
21',action,"Millwall are struggling to get on the ball at the moment, they are allowing the Foxes too much time and space on the ball. When the Lions do get the ball they are trying long balls up front to Steve Morison, which so far the Leicester defence are dealing with."
19',action,"Another good piece of play from Leicester! Musa is the latest player to have a shot at goal, he cuts inside and then fires a low shot at goal from the edge of the penalty box, which goes narrowly wide of the post."
17',action,WHAT A SAVE! Archer pulls off a superb stop to deny Andy King from the resulting corner! The looked like it was heading into the back of the net.
16',action,CHANCE LEICESTER! A huge block by Bryon Webster stops an almost certain Musa goal! Shinji Okazaki ran through on goal but Jordan Archer makes a great save to block his shot. The rebound falls kindly for Musa but Webster blocks his effort. Leicester corner.
14',action,"Good pressure from Leicester, penning Millwall into their own half and they are starting to play some good football. The pitch quality isn't as good as the King Power Stadium and that can be seen in a few misplaced passes and crosses, as the ball is often bobbling up, causing mistakes."
11',action,"New Leicester signing Molla Wague has given away a free-kick for a foul on Fred Onyedinma, which is in a very good position for Millwall to get the ball into the box. However the Foxes deal with the ball well and clear the danger."
10',action,"CHANCE LEICESTER! Gray has been terrific so far here today. The winger was given far too much time and space in the box and he attempted to curl the ball into the top right-hand corner from a tight angle, but his right-footed shot is too high. First chance of the game."
8',action,"There is plenty of Premier League talent on the bench for Leicester here today, should they need to use them. The Foxes travel to Spain on Tuesday ahead of their Champions League tie against Sevilla on Wednesday evening. A lot of the Leicester supporters and players surely have an eye on that game already."
6',action,"Great run through the middle of the pitch through Gray, the Leicester man uses his incredible pace to beat the covering Millwall defence, however his final ball to Musa is overhit and the chance goes away. Bright start by the Foxes here."
4',action,"It's a packed out crowd here at The Den as Millwall look to continue their FA Cup journey. All of the Lions FA Cup games this season have been at home, keeping clean sheets in three of their four FA Cup games this season, conceding twice to Braintree Town in the second round."
2',action,Leicester got the game started for us here and they have enjoyed a good start so far. They are keeping the ball well and are trying to break the deadlock early on here. Ahmed Musa whipped a ball into the box for Demarai Gray but the winger didn't make good contact with the ball and his attempt is well off target.
1',action,We're underway!
,action,Both teams are out and kick-off is almost upon us here at The Den!
,action,"Head-to-head: Millwall and Leicester met in the fifth round in 1985, with the Lions coming out on top in that game, winning 2-0 at home. They have played each other four times in the FA Cup in total, each time at Millwall, with two wins apiece. The Foxes have been victorious in their last two games against Millwall, which came in the 2013/14 Championship season."
,action,"TEAM NEWS: Claudio Ranieri promised changes and he has certainly done that today, making 10 changes to the side that were beaten by Swansea last Sunday. Only Demarai Gray keeps his place and there's a debut for on loan Udinese defender Molla Wague. Whilst Millwall boss Neil Harris is fielding his strongest available team. The only change from Tuesday's win over Port Vale is the injured Jed Wallace being replaced by Shane Ferguson."

,action,"Islam Slimani will miss the game with a groin injury. The striker was a second-half substitute in the Foxes' 2-0 defeat at Swansea on Sunday. As well as Slimani, Leonardo Ulloa is also likely to sit out for Leicester with a thigh problem. Ron-Robert Zieler is likely to Kasper Schmeichel in goal and Ben Chilwell, Demarai Gray, Nampalys Mendy and Shinji Okazaki are all in line to start."
,action,"Whilst Millwall's 10-match unbeaten run has propelled them into the League One play-off places. They have not lost a match since December 17, having beaten two Premier League opponents en route to the fifth round, Bournemouth and Watford."
,action,"The FA Cup has offered solace to a Leicester team fighting for their Premier League survival following a run of five straight league defeats, which has left them just one place above the relegation zon.e Their only two victories in 2017 have both come in the competition - at Everton in the third round and via a replay against Derby in the fourth round."
