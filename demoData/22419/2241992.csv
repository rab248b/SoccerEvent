,action,"The referee blows his whistle for the final time and the Hull fans go wild! It's totally understandable, as their side were excellent this afternoon and thoroughly deserve to leave with all three points. They sat deep and frustrated Liverpool with brilliant defending before hitting the Reds' disjointed back line with several well-worked counter-attacking moves."
,action,FULL-TIME: HULL CITY 2-0 LIVERPOOL
90'+4',action,"Sturridge goes close! Origi and Firmino link up well before the latter chips a clever pass into the heart of the Hull penalty area, but, despite being at full stretch, Sturridge is unable to make contact with the ball in front of goal."
90'+2',action,"Liverpool look completely bereft of ideas inside the Hull half of the pitch, where their passing has become sloppy and wayward. This time it's Coutinho who sends his attempted pass well away from a red shirt and out for a throw-in."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be five minutes of added time.
89',action,"Great save by Jakupovic! Yet another Liverpool corner is just about dealt with by Hull before falling to Henderson on the edge of the penalty area, but the captain's thumping strike is somehow parried away by a fantastic diving stop from the Swiss goalkeeper."
88',action,"Another Liverpool attack comes to an end and allows Niasse to fly forward before winning his side a free-kick over on the left wing. It's fired into the visitors' half of the pitch and on to the head of Meyler, but the Irishman can only find Mignolet with his towering header just outside of the box."
86',action,"It's all Liverpool as they desperately try to find a way back into the game, but Hull have every available body camped behind the ball and are easily able to bring an end to another poor attacking move from the visitors, who look bereft of ideas."
84',assist,"Assist Andrea Ranocchia. Liverpool were awful defensively, but that pass forward from Ranocchia was exquisite. The Italian has put in an excellent shift in the middle of a very impressive Hull back line."
84',goal,"Goal El-Hadji Baye Oumar Niasse. GOAL! Hull have scored again! Mane is dispossessed on the edge of the hosts' penalty area, allowing the home side to fly forward on another counter-attack. Ranocchia picks up the ball and immediately fires it over the top of the Liverpool defence and into the path of Niasse, who skips past both Lucas and Matip far too easily before slotting the ball under Mignolet to make it 2-0."
83',substitution,"Substitution sub-out James Milner sub-in Alberto Moreno Pérez . And the second is Alberto Moreno, who replaces Milner."
83',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Adam Lallana sub-in Divock Okoth Origi . Liverpool have made a double substitution as they desperately try to find a way back into the game. The first player to come on is Divock Origi, who takes the place of Lallana."
82',action,"Nervy moments for Liverpool! Hull break forward on another attacking move before winning themselves a free-kick, which is curled into the visitors' box. It pinballs around dangerously before almost falling to Maguire at the far post, but, despite his best efforts, the defender is unable to make contact with the ball."
80',substitution,Substitution sub-out Kamil Grosicki sub-in David Meyler . Grosicki receives a rousing round of applause from the home fans as he's replaced by sub-in David Meyler in a defensive change by Hull.
79',action,"Hull push forward on a rare foray into the Liverpool half of the pitch as Robertson darts down the left wing, but the full-back is unable to beat Clyne and the Liverpool man does well to shepherd the ball out for a goal-kick, which Mignolet quickly blasts up the pitch."
77',action,"Clyne and Mane link up well deep down the right flank before the full-back fires a cross-cum-shot towards the near post. It looks as if it could end up causing problems for Jakupovic, but the goalkeeper adjusts his body well to tip the ball round the post and out for a corner."
75',action,"Milner's cross into the penalty area is easily cut out by Clucas before dropping back to Milner once again, but the full-back's strike from the edge of the box is completely overhit and sails comfortably over the top of the crossbar and out for a goal-kick."
74',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Josh Tymon. Tymon dives into Mane and brings the Senegalese midfielder crashing to the ground from behind, leaving the referee with no choice but to award Liverpool a free-kick in a very dangerous position deep down the right flank."
72',action,"Milner, who has spent most of the afternoon inside the Hull half of the pitch, cuts inside from the left wing before trying to test Jakupovic with a bouncing shot from 25 yards out, but it isn't hit well enough to trouble the Hull goalkeeper and the strike is easily saved at the far post."
71',action,"A curling cross flies over to the far post and finds Lallana in a pocket of space. He spins past Elabdellaoui and then fizzing a pass across the face of goal, but, once again, Hull are just about able to hold on to their slender lead with a last-gasp clearance."
69',action,"Milner twists and turns deep down the left wing before cutting inside and chipping a cross towards Sturridge, but, not for the first time this afternoon, Maguire is there to cut out the danger with a strong headed clearance."
67',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Emre Can sub-in Daniel Sturridge . Liverpool have made an attacking change, with Can making way for sub-in Daniel Sturridge."
66',action,"How did Liverpool not score?! Ball after ball is flung into the Hull penalty area and towards goal before Coutinho is presented with the best opportunity of all at the far post, but the Brazilian gets his shot all wrong and sends it spinning away from goal. He really should have buried that!"
65',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Abel Mathías Hernández Platero sub-in El-Hadji Baye Oumar Niasse . Hull have made their second alteration, with Oumar Niasse coming on to take the place of Hernandez."
64',action,"Another chance for Hernandez! This time it's Grosicki who flies forward on a great run before threading a lovely through-ball into the path of Hernandez, but Mignolet is there once again to close down and dispossess the striker before he can shoot."
63',action,"Hernandez hits the side-netting! Huddlestone chips a beautiful pass over the top of the Liverpool back line and into the path of Hernandez, who had made a great run into the box. The Uruguayan decides not to hit the ball first time, however, and it allows Mignolet to close down the angle and force the striker into firing his shot wide of the near post."
62',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Evandro Goebel sub-in Josh Tymon . Hull have made their first substituton of the game, with Evandro making way for sub-in Josh Tymon."

58',action,"It's all Liverpool at the moment as they continue pushing forward and putting the Hull back line under an incredible amount of pressure, but this time it's Ranocchia who's able to cut out the danger by getting a head on a cross from Coutinho."
56',action,"What a save by Jakupovic! Lallana cuts inside from the left flank before curling a wonderful cross right on to the head of Mane, but the midfielder's looping header is pushed away by a great one-handed stop from the Hull goalkeeper."
54',action,"Henderson is easily dispossessed in the middle of the pitch, allowing Evandro to fly forward on a quick counter-attack. The Brazilian runs into the Liverpool half of the pitch and then takes on Firmino, but he ends up being fouled by a cynical clip from the Liverpool man."
52',action,"A curling cross from Clyne is deflected out to Grosicki, but the Polish midfielder falls asleep on the edge of the box. It allows Can to beat him to the ball before nodding it over to Milner, but the full-back's first-time volley is tame and easily saved by Jakupovic."
51',action,"Mane battles his way into the left-hand side of the Hull penalty area before taking on Ranocchia, but the Italian does really well to stick to the Senegalese forward before guiding the ball out for a goal-kick. The Liverpool players all want a corner, but the referee isn't at all interested."
49',action,"And now Can goes close! Another curling cross from a corner finds a red shirt in front of goal, but Can is unable to beat Jakupovic with his near-post header, despite the goalkeeper fumbling the ball ever so slightly."
48',action,"Chance for Matip! Lallana charges towards the Hull box but is dispossessed by Huddlestone, who pokes the ball out for a corner. The first quickly results in a second, but Matip's rushed shot at the far post is well blocked by Huddlestone."
47',action,"Grosicki quickly breaks down the right wing on a marauding run before being bundled over from behind, resulting in a free-kick for Hull in a dangerous position. The Poland international steps up before firing a low cross towards the near post, but it isn't hit well enough to trouble the Liverpool defence."
46',action,And we're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"It's been an excellent opening 45 minutes for Hull, who have impressed at both ends of the pitch and deservedly head into the half-time break with a one-goal lead. They've defended diligently to continually frustrate Liverpool whenever the visitors push forward, whilst, at the other end of the pitch, they've looked bright on the break, with Hernandez, Grosicki and Evandro all doing well in advanced positions."
,action,HALF-TIME: HULL CITY 1-0 LIVERPOOL
45'+2',action,"Liverpool desperately break down the right flank as they try to find a way back into the game, but Hull have plenty of bodies back to deal with the danger before the referee brings an end to what has been a great first half for the home side."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be two minutes of added time.
44',goal,"Goal Alfred John Momar N'Diaye. GOAL! Hull have taken the lead! A swinging cross flies in from a corner and finds Ranocchia in a great position.

43',action,"Mane loses out midway inside the Hull penalty area and, once again, the hosts counter-attack quickly. Evandro bursts into the visitors' half of the pitch before trying to tee up Hernandez, but the Brazilian's pass is slightly overhit and Matip is there to deal with the danger."
41',action,"Clucas steps up and curls a cross into the Liverpool box, but it's just about dealt with by the visitors. The hosts come back once again, however, through Robertson, but Hernandez isn't able to control the defender's lofted pass and loses out to three red shirts."
40',yellow-card,"Yellow Card James Milner. Coutinho steps up and shoots from the set-piece, but he's unable to beat the wall in front of him and allows Hull to counter quickly. They do so well over on the right wing before Robertson tries to skip past Milner down the left, but the Liverpool full-back holds out a hand and cynically handles the ball, resulting in a free-kick for the home side."
39',action,"The ball pinballs around the edge of the Hull penalty area before falling to Clyne, who is then clattered into by a hefty challenge from Tom Huddlestone, resulting in a free-kick for Liverpool in a very dangerous position."
37',action,"Grosicki is looking bright over on the right flank, where he's done well when presented with a chance to push forward. He does so once again before poking a pass into the path of N'Diaye, who then swings a cross into the middle of the box. It finds Clucas in a good position, but, off balance, he's unable to test Mignolet with his headed effort."
35',action,"Once again, Hull try to catch out Liverpool with a long ball forward after doing well to win back possession, but Hernandez's header on to Clucas finds the winger in an offside position and the linesman's flag is quickly raised."
33',action,"Hull are presented with a rare chance to push forward after doing well to bring yet another Liverpool attacking move to an end. Grosicki brings down a lofted pass over the right flank before firing a dangerous low cross into the penalty area, but Hernandez is beaten to it by Mignolet by the narrowest of margins."
31',action,"Liverpool are continuing to enjoy the vast majority of possession as they keep putting Hull under pressure, but the home side are defending well and making life tough for the Reds' front line, giving Jakupovic little to deal with so far."
29',action,"Grosicki does well to reach the ball deep down the right wing after latching on to a thumped pass forward from Ranocchia, but he's unable to whip a cross into the Liverpool penalty area and sends it flying out of play for a throw-in on the opposite flank."

26',action,"Mane skips past a sliding tackle from Maguire and heads down the right-hand side of the Hull penalty area before chipping a cross towards Firmino, but Elabdellaoui reads the danger well and is there to head the ball away from danger."
25',action,"Evandro is brought down from behind by Henderson, resulting in a free-kick for Hull in a promising area of the pitch. Evandro steps up and chips a cross into the box and towards Maguire, but it's easily cut out by Mignolet before it can reach the defender."

21',action,"What an opportunity for Philippe Coutinho! Firmino twists and turns on the left-hand side of the Hull box before chipping a dangerous cross into the middle of the penalty area.

20',action,"Matip breaks into the Hull half of the pitch before firing a lofted pass over the top of the hosts' back line and over to Mane. It misses the Senegalese forward and bounces over to Firmino, but Elabdellaoui reads the danger well to stop it from finding the Brazilian in a pocket of space."
18',action,"Elabdellaoui returns to the pitch as Jakupovic gets the game underway with a goal-kick. It's easily picked up by Liverpool, who quickly fire a lofted pass into the Hull penalty area. However, Andrew Robertson is there to get a touch on the ball to stop it from finding a red shirt."
17',action,"Roberto Firmino holds up the ball really well on the left-hand side of the Hull box before teeing up Milner, who is left in an acre of space by Grosicki. The full-back is unable to tee up a team-mate, however, and has to settle for a corner that fails to result in a chance on goal."
15',action,"Ouch! Elabdellaoui got caught by a flailing arm from Milner as the two battled for the ball, and it's left him with a bloody nose that requires him to leave the pitch and receive medical attention."
14',action,"James Milner skips down the left flank and does well to latch on to a lofted pass forward before trying to whip a cross into the Hull penalty area, but he's flagged offside just as he's about to do so, despite it looking as if Harry Maguire was playing him onside."
12',action,"Hull break forward once again after a half-hearted Liverpool attacking move comes to an end, but Hernandez is quickly closed down by red shirts as he ploughs towards the penalty area and is dispossessed before he can unleash a shot."
10',action,"Chance for N'Diaye! Another good passage of play from Hull results in an opportunity on goal for N'Diaye, who did well to link up with Evandro. The Senegalese midfielder's shot isn't the best, however, and bounces harmlessly into the hands of Simon Mignolet."
9',action,"Hernandez slips into the left-hand side of the Liverpool penalty area and easily spins past Matip before firing a low cross-cum-shot over to the far post, but it's sent slightly ahead of Sam Clucas and Grosicki and ends up missing both players."
7',action,"Kamil Grosicki shows good skill on the ball as he sets up Omar Elabdellaoui, who then does well to win his side a throw-in. Hull initially lose out before Evandro tries to pick out Abel Hernandez with a chipped pass forward, but it's one that Joel Matip is just about able to get his head on."
5',action,"A thumping Andrea Ranocchia clearance seems to have brought an end to a Liverpool attack, but the home side quickly push forward once again. Sadio Mane brings the ball down in the middle of the pitch before trying to beat Jakupovic from 30 yards out, but his half-volley is far too powerful and ends up clearing the top of the crossbar."
4',action,"Liverpool patiently pass the ball around inside the Hull half of the pitch as they try to carve out a second chance on goal. Nathaniel Clyne cuts inside from the right-hand side of the box and then pokes a pass into the path of Adam Lallana, but it's cut out by Alfred N'Diaye at the vital moment."
2',action,"Emre Can is presented with an early chance to fire Liverpool into the lead after a bouncing cross from Jordan Henderson finds the German inside the Hull penalty area, but his curling strike isn't hit well enough to test Eldin Jakupovic and sails comfortably wide of the far post."

,action,"Liverpool comfortably thrashed Hull 5-1 earlier in the season but now must take on a newly revitalised side that have won each of their previous three home games.

,action,"Tuesday evening saw Liverpool’s winless run extend to four games on what was a tough night against Chelsea, who now sit 13 points clear of the Reds thanks to this afternoon’s win against Arsenal. Klopp’s men did show some signs of improvement in the draw against the league leaders, and they will be hoping that they can build on that performance today as they welcome back Sadio Mane, who has been sorely missed during his time away at the Africa Cup of Nations."
,action,"Despite being four games into 2017, Liverpool are yet to win a single league clash this year, leaving them in real danger of dropping out of the top four if they’re unable to quickly turn around their season. Just three points from their previous four games represents their worst run under Jurgen Klopp, and, with tough fixtures against Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal fast approaching, they head to the KCOM desperate for a victory."
