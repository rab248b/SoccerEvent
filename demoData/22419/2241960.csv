,action,"That win will certainly go down as the best of Koeman's time at Everton, and it was a fully deserved one for the Toffees. They were excellent from start to finish, as they constantly kept at bay a struggling City front line before causing the visitors plenty of problems on the break. Otamendi and Stones were all over the place at the back, resulting in Lukaku thoroughly enjoying himself every time he ploughed forward."
,action,FULL-TIME: EVERTON 4-0 MANCHESTER CITY
90'+4',goal,"Goal Ademola Lookman. GOAL! It's Lookman on his debut! Stones is caught by Coleman deep down the right flank and fires an attempted clearance off the wing-back and over to Lookman, who then easily slots a wonderful shot past Bravo and into the back of the net to inflict more misery on a very poor City side."

90'+2',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Romelu Lukaku Menama. It's all kicking off! Otamendi and Lukaku tangle over on the right flank, resulting in a confrontation between the two players. The Belgian squares up to the defender, who then theatrically throws himself to the ground, resulting in an angry reaction from Koeman. There wasn't any contact between the two but Lukaku nonetheless receives a yellow card."
90',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Ross Barkley sub-in Ademola Lookman . Everton have made their final change of the game, with Barkley making way for young debutant sub-in Ademola Lookman."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be four minutes of added time.
89',action,"Sterling peels into the right-hand side of the Everton penalty area and does well to latch on to a long ball forward from Aguero, but he's unable to find a way past Funes Mori and ends up losing out to the Argentine."
87',action,"Lukaku breaks through the disjointed City back line as he tries to latch on to a lofted pass forward, but his run is slightly mistimed and the linesman's flag is raised as soon as the Belgian is about to take on Bravo."
85',action,"Lukaku almost makes it 4-0! The striker charges into the left-hand side of the Everton penalty area before chipping a deft shot over the on-rushing Bravo, but it's slightly mishit and bounces a few yards wide of the far post before being thumped away by Otamendi."
83',action,"Davies brings an end to another City attacking move before trying to break forward, but he's brought crashing to the ground by clumsy challenge from Sterling. It provokes an angry reaction from the midfielder, with Holgate and Aguero then getting involved before the referee finally brings the fracas to an end."
81',action,"Aguero quickly breaks into the right-hand side of the Everton penalty area as City push forward from the restart, but his low shot fails to beat Joel and is easily stopped by the Spaniard in the middle of the goal."
79',goal,"Goal Tom Davies. GOAL! The day keeps getting better for Everton! Davies embarks on a driving run forward as he ploughs his way down the right flank. He then cuts inside and finds Barkley, who skips past his marker and tees up the youngster to chip a deft shot over Bravo and into the back of the net for his first ever senior goal. What a moment for the teenager!"
79',assist,Assist Ross Barkley. Assist Ross Barkley
77',action,"Schneiderlin brings Sterling crashing to the ground and concedes a free-kick 25 yards away from the Everton goal. Toure steps up and tries to beat Joel with a curling strike, but it's hit too near to the goalkeeper and is easily saved."
75',yellow-card,"Yellow Card David Josué Jiménez Silva. City push forward once again as he drives down the right wing before trying to tee up Iheanacho on the edge of the Everton penalty area. The youngster loses out, however, before Davies drives forward, but Silva cynically fouls the youngster to earn himself a yellow card."
74',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Gareth Barry sub-in James McCarthy . sub-in James McCarthy comes on to replace Barry, who receives a standing ovation from the Everton fans as he leaves the pitch."
73',action,"Everton seem content to sit deep as they attempt to contain City, who are committing plenty of bodies forward but are doing very little with the ball. The introduction of Iheanacho hasn't had the desired effect, leaving Aguero just as isolated as he was before."
71',action,"Aguero drops deep in search of the ball and picks it up just outside of the Everton penalty area. He's left in a pocket of space and is able to get a shot away, but Joel quickly dives to his left to tip the Argentine's effort round the far post and out for another City corner."
69',action,"Sagna peels away from his marker deep down the right wing and cuts inside quickly before firing a low cross towards Iheanacho at the near post, but he's unable to find the youngster and has to settle for a corner that, despite finding Otamendi, doesn't result in a chance on goal."
67',action,"Comical mistake by Stones! The former Everton defender gives the home fans something the laugh about with an attempted clearance that goes terribly wrong, resulting in the ball spinning up into the air and down to Lukaku, who then easily skips away from his former team-mate."
65',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Kevin Mirallas sub-in Morgan Schneiderlin . Mirallas receives a rousing round of applause from the Everton fans as he makes way for sub-in Morgan Schneiderlin, who is also showered with praise as he comes on to make his debut for the club."
63',action,"De Bruyne drifts out to the right wing and picks up the ball in a pocket of space before fizzing a fierce pass across the face of goal, but Iheanacho is unable to meet the ball with his outstretched leg and loses out to Joel at the near post."
62',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Pablo Javier Zabaleta Girod sub-in Kelechi Promise Iheanacho . City have made their first substitution of the game, with Zabaleta making way for Kelechi Iheanacho."
61',action,"It's all City at the moment as they continue pushing plenty of bodies forward in search of a way back into the game, but, as has been the case for most of the afternoon, they're lacking that cutting edge in front of goal, which is making life surprisingly easy for Everton."
59',action,"City quickly push forward once again before Sagna tries to pick out Aguero with a looping cross into the heart of the Everton penalty area, but this time it's Funes Mori who rises high to deny the Argentine a chance on goal."
58',action,"A slightly clumsy challenge from Davies sends Silva flying to the ground and results in another free-kick for City in a dangerous position over on the left wing. This time it's De Bruyne who whips a cross into the box, but it's poorly hit and is easily dealt with by Lukaku."
56',action,"Once again, a curling cross is fired towards the far post, where Stones is waiting, but the former Everton defender is unable to reach the ball and it ends up fizzing just a few inches over the top of his head."

54',action,"Lukaku holds up the ball well on the edge of the City penalty area whilst waiting for Coleman, who he then tees up with a deft, poked pass. The wing-back quickly whips a cross into the box and towards Barkley, but it's slightly too high and flies over the head of the midfielder."
53',action,"Zabaleta goes down after tangling with Barkley and wins City a free-kick in a dangerous position 30 yards away from goal. After taking his time eyeing up the target, Silva chips a deft cross into the box that finds Stones, but the defender can only nod his header straight into the hands of Joel."
51',action,"A lengthy spell of City possession eventually ends with De Bruyne over on the left flank, who then pokes a clever pass towards Sterling. The winger makes a clever run as he darts into the box to try to meet it, but he's unable to keep the ball in play and gives away a goal-kick."
49',action,"Aguero is bundled over by Williams on the right wing and wins City a free-kick in a promising position. It fails to result in a chance on goal, however, as the whipped ball in towards the near post is easily fired away by Lukaku."

47',goal,"Goal Kevin Mirallas. GOAL! What a start by Everton! Toure is clumsy in possession and ends up losing out to Lukaku, who then immediately tries to tee up Mirallas.

46',action,And we're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"All in all, it was a perfect first half for Everton, who defended well to continually frustrate a City front line that struggled to cause Joel too many problems. At the other end, Lukaku drifted in and out of the game due to the visitors' dominance of possession, but he was on hand to fire them into the lead with a cool finish that came from a sloppy Clichy pass. City are going to have to do much more in front of goal if they're to get back into the game."
,action,HALF-TIME: EVERTON 1-0 MANCHESTER CITY
45'+2',action,"Off the line by Davies! Clichy darts down the left wing and chips a great cross over to Sagna. The right-back rises high above Baines and sends a looping header over Joel and towards the top left-hand corner of the net, but Davies is there to head the ball away from goal."
45'+1',action,"Aguero cuts inside from the left wing and picks out De Bruyne with a clever chipped cross into the Everton penalty area. The Belgian does well to meet the ball before trying to nod it down to Sterling, but Joel is there to collect the ball under very little pressure."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be two minutes of added time.
44',action,"Barry breaks down a City attack and immediately sets up Lukaku with an excellent lofted pass over the top of the City defence. The Belgian darts over to the ball before taking on Otamendi, but the defender comes out on top and pokes the ball out for a corner that the visitors are just about able to deal with."
43',action,"A poor touch from Toure gifts possession to Barkley, but the Englishman incurs the wrath of the Everton faithful with a lazy pass that fails to find a blue shirt in an advanced position. He had been given the time and space to plough forward but, for some strange reason, decided not to do so."
42',action,"Once again, City are sloppy in possession in the middle of the pitch and allow the home side to quickly hit them on a counter-attack, but Mirallas is unable to find Barkley over on the left wing and the latter ends up losing out to Otamendi in a promising position."
40',action,"De Bruyne is dispossessed deep down the left wing and Everton counter quickly. Lukaku holds up the ball brilliantly before linking up with Barkley, who then sets up Coleman over on the right flank, but the wing-back's looping cross is poor and sails straight into the hands of Bravo before it can find Lukaku in front of goal."
38',action,"And now Sterling goes close! The resulting corner is half dealt with by Everton before a headed clearance from Davies can only find Sterling, who takes a quick touch before unleashing a rocket of a shot that flies just wide of the near post after beating Joel."
37',action,"Inches away from Aguero! De Bruyne embarks on another impressive run down the left wing before fizzing an excellent pass across the face of goal, but, despite his best efforts, Aguero is unable to reach the ball with his outstretched leg and it ends up being cleared out for a corner."
36',action,"Mirallas battles hard with Clichy before firing a deflected cross off the Frenchman and up into the air. It almost falls to Lukaku before bouncing over to Baines, but the defender is unable to get the ball under control and eventually loses out before he can get a shot away."
34',assist,"Assist Kevin Mirallas. Mirallas did wonderfully well to beat Toure before teeing up Lukaku, but questions have to be asked of the City defence. Clichy's attempt to play the ball out from the back was poor, and Toure should have done better defensively in the build-up to the goal."
34',goal,"Goal Romelu Lukaku Menama. GOAL! Everton have taken the lead! A poor pass from Gael Clichy can only find Davies, who ploughs forward before teeing up Mirallas. The Belgian is easily able to skip past Yaya Toure on the edge of the box and then spins and finds Lukaku, who calmly slots a lovely shot past Bravo and into the bottom right-hand corner of the net."
32',action,"After winning the ball back, City fly forward on a great counter-attack thanks to a clever pass from Aguero. Sterling charges through the middle of the pitch and then tries to pick out Zabaleta with a deft through-ball, but the Argentine's run towards the penalty area is slightly mistimed and the linesman's flag is quickly raised as a result."
31',action,"A cross-field pass from Barkley finds Coleman, who then forces Stones into heading the ball out for an Everton throw-in. It's taken quickly and worked over to Davies, but the midfielder's first touch is poor and he gifts possession back to City."
29',action,"Davies has a little nibble at Silva and brings down the Spaniard from behind, leaving the referee with no choice but to award City a free-kick in a dangerous position 25 yards away from the Everton goal. It's De Bruyne who decides to have the shot, but his effort is a poor one and fails to beat the wall of blue shirts camped in front of him."
27',action,"What a chance for Silva! Funes Mori loses possession in a dangerous position, allowing City to fly forward on a quick counter-attack. De Bruyne cuts inside from the left wing and picks out Silva with a wonderful cross into the box, but the Spaniard is slightly too slow on the ball and is closed down by Joel before he can get a decent shot away."
26',action,"Poor pass from Barkley! The midfielder charges through the middle of the pitch and has a great opportunity to set up Mirallas with a deft pass into the City box, but he completely messes up his attempted through-ball and sends the ball rolling harmlessly out for a goal-kick."
25',action,"Vital block by Stones! A thumping pass forward almost finds Mirallas on the edge of the City penalty area after he had made a great run forward, but Stones is just about able to readjust his feet at the right moment and gets enough of a touch on the ball to send it away from the Belgian, who would have had a chance to go one-on-one with Bravo."
24',action,"Aguero sprints down the left flank and cuts inside before being clumsily fouled by Holgate, resulting in a City free-kick just a yard or so outside of the Everton penalty area. Silva steps up and fires a low cross into the middle of the box, but it's underhit and fails to find Aguero in front of goal."
23',action,"A sloppy pass from Aguero on the edge of the Everton box results in another promising City attacking move coming to an end. The home side take the opportunity to counter quickly through Mirallas, but the Belgian's cross-field pass fails to pick out Lukaku and is instead met by Sagna."
21',action,"Sterling darts through the middle of the pitch on an impressive run and does well to beat two Everton midfielders. He then spots a run forward from Zabaleta and tries to pick out the Argentine with a through-ball into the penalty area, but it's well read by Joel and easily cut out by the goalkeeper."
19',action,"Almost a costly mistake by Bravo! John Stones, who has received plenty of boos and jeers from the Everton fans, is put under pressure and has to poke a pass back to Bravo. The goalkeeper isn't closed down too much but nonetheless causes panic with a sloppy first touch, but he's able to recover before releasing the ball to Otamendi. Barkley was lurking with intent and could have caused City problems if Bravo's touch was slightly heavier."
18',action,"Everton patiently work the ball around inside the City half of the pitch before Davies is put under pressure and forced into working the ball back to Williams. The defender spots a run forward from Mirallas and tries to pick him out with a cross-field pass, but it's completely overhit and sails straight out of play."
17',action,"Lukaku holds up the ball well over on the right-hand side of the City penalty area before cutting on to his left foot and curling a cross over to Barkley. The midfielder is in a good position in front of goal and looks set to reach the ball, but Nicolas Otamendi does well to beat him in the air."
16',action,"De Bruyne once again causes problems down the left flank. He skips past his marker with ease and cuts inside before trying to pick out Aguero in front of goal, but this time it's Williams who is able to dive in front of the Argentine to deny him an opportunity to shoot."
14',action,"Sterling breaks through the Everton back line once again as he flies forward in search of a lofted pass, but he's unable to make contact with the ball before it safely bounces into the hands of Joel."
12',action,"Sterling goes down inside the box, but nothing is given! De Bruyne flies down the left flank on a great run before picking out Sterling inside the penalty area. The winger takes one touch before going down under challenges from both Joel and Leighton Baines, but the referee waves away the protests from the City players and allows play to go on."
11',action,"Pablo Zabaleta is sloppy on the ball in the middle of the pitch and loses out to Barkley, who then wins the home side a corner. It's flung into the box and pinballs around dangerously before City are just about able to deal with the danger and break away on a blisteringly quick counter-attack."
10',action,"David Silva twists and turns as he weaves his way into the Everton penalty area, but he's quickly closed down by blue shirts and is unable to find a way past Ashley Williams. The defender can only poke the ball over to Bacary Sagna, however, and the full-back then tries to pick out Raheem Sterling with a curling cross, but it's poorly hit and sails out of play for a throw-in."
9',action,"Mirallas scores, but it's ruled out for offside! Everton move the ball around brilliantly inside the City penalty area before Seamus Coleman set up Mirallas with a lovely dink across the box, but the linesman's flag is raised before the Belgian pokes the ball into the back of the net from close range."
8',action,"Barry is pushed over by De Bruyne, resulting in the referee awarding Everton a free-kick in a dangerous position 30 yards away from the City goal. Kevin Mirallas steps up and curls a cross into the middle of the box, but it fails to find a blue shirt and is well dealt with by the visitors' defence."
7',action,"City patiently pass the ball around deep inside the Everton half of the pitch as they try to carve out an early chance on goal, but this time it's Aguero who strays slightly offside, bringing a promising attacking move to a disappointing end over on the left flank."
5',action,"Aguero is dispossessed just outside of the Everton box and the home side immediately try to hit City on a swift counter-attack. Barry does well to charge forward before firing a lofted pass up to Romelu Lukaku, but the ball is slightly overhit and is easily dealt with by Claudio Bravo."
4',action,"Tom Davies and Barry link up well in the middle of the pitch before spinning and picking out Ramiro Funes Mori. The defender lifts his head and immediately picks out Ross Barkley with a thumping pass forward, but the midfielder's run towards the City box is slightly mistimed and the linesman's flag is raised as soon as he receives the ball."
2',action,"Kevin De Bruyne darts down the left wing on a marauding run before taking on Mason Holgate. He does well to fire a low cross through the legs of the youngster and towards Sergio Aguero, but just as the ball is about to reach the striker, Gareth Barry flies in front of the Argentine to stop it from doing so."
1',action,"And we're off! Everton get us underway, attacking from right to left."

,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"Koeman was recently granted his wish with the acquisition of Morgan Schneiderlin and Ademola Lookman, both of whom could feature today after being named on the substitutes’ bench. A positive impact from the duo could end up being needed if Everton are unable to break down City, who haven’t lost a league game at Goodison Park in almost four years."
,action,"As for Everton, they have managed to embark on a three-game unbeaten run for only the second time this season thanks to a much-needed 3-0 win against Southampton two weeks ago, but Ronald Koeman was left seething by his side’s poor performance last weekend. The Toffees surrendered a 1-0 lead and ended up losing 2-1 against Leicester City in the FA Cup, resulting in the Dutchman blasting his players and demanding new signings to strengthen his squad."
,action,"Another red card for Fernandinho made it a tough afternoon, but City’s last league outing resulted in a 2-1 win against Burnley that helped them bounce back from the defeat against Liverpool. As a result, they can move equal on points with second-place Tottenham Hotspur with a victory today, something that they’ll desperately want to do ahead of next weekend’s vitally important meeting between the two sides."
,action,"Pep Guardiola’s last visit to Merseyside resulted in a frustrating 1-0 defeat against Liverpool, but it remains the only time in their previous six games that they’ve failed to win. After suffering a poor start to December, City have won five times since the defeat against Leicester City just over a month ago, with West Ham the latest to suffer a thumping at the hands of the Citizens."
