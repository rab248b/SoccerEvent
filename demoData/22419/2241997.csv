,action,"That's all for our live coverage from Vicarage Road, thanks for following along. Goodbye!"
,action,"First-half goals from Troy Deeney and M'Baye Niang narrowly sees the Hornets past the 10-man Clarets, with Jeff Hendrick issued his marching orders after just six minutes, after a second-half rally from Sean Dyche's side cut the deficit in half."
90'+4',action,FULL-TIME: WATFORD 2-1 BURNLEY.
90'+4',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Craig Cathcart. THREE FOR BURNLEY! But it won't count! Deeney's goal is called back and Burnley quickly get back the other way, with Watford caught a bit, and Cathcart slides into a clear foul, taking one for the team to halt a break."
90'+2',action,"Barnes is called on the offside and Watford are in no rush to restart play. Fatigue has understandably set in for the visitors, and it looks as though their impressive second-half rally is destined to fall just short. There still is time for perhaps one last attack."
90',action,The fourth official indicates a minimum of four minutes of stoppage-time at the end of this match.
89',action,"There's a real sense of tension around the ground at Vicarage. The bulk of the noise is coming from these travelling supporters, who are thrilled with the display of their side in the second half, and especially eager as the Clarets continue to keep the pressure on into the final minute of the 90 here."
87',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Mauro Zárate sub-in Daryl Janmaat . Watford's final change sees full-back sub-in Daryl Janmaat replace Zarate. The Hornets are just hanging on here, despite being up a man."
86',substitution,"Substitution sub-out George Boyd sub-in Sam Vokes . A final roll of the dice here for Sean Dyche, who brings on striker sub-in Sam Vokes in place of Boyd for the final few minutes."
84',action,STAT: This is the sixth time in Premier League history that a team have won just one point or fewer in their first 10 away games of a season – each of the previous five teams have been relegated at the end of that campaign (incl. Burnley in 09/10).
82',action,"THEY'RE COMING ON! Brady is sprung down the left, but he's forced to take the chance early as support is lacking. The substitute drives a half-volley at goal, struck with some real venom, but it's too close to Gomes who makes a simple save. You can feel the momentum shifting here, however."
81',substitution,"Substitution sub-out M'Baye Babacar Niang sub-in Isaac Ajayi Success . Sensing the need to bring on some fresh legs, Mazzarri makes his first change of the afternoon as Isaac Success replaces Niang, who can hold his head high and proud after his display this afternoon."
78',penalty-goal,Penalty Goal Ashley Barnes. GAME ON! A lifeline for Burnley as Barnes pings his penalty off the inside of the post and into the back of the net to cut the deficit in half. There's no keeping that one out!
77',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Sebastian Prödl. BURNLEY HAVE A PENALTY! It's really no less than they deserve, either! Prodl can have little dispute with this decision, as he quite clearly blocks the shot of Barton with his arm, denying the Clarets a goal. In fact, he may be a bit lucky not to be sent off!"
77',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Scott Arfield sub-in Ashley Westwood . It's Arfield's last contribution of the afternoon as he's replaced by another January signing, sub-in Ashley Westwood."
76',action,"GOOD HIT! Enticing effort there from Arfield, who strikes one at goal from just over 20 yards, stinging the hands of Gomes who tips it high up into the air before catching it on the way down."
74',action,STAT: Watford are unbeaten in their last five home Premier League matches against newly-promoted sides (W2 D3) without conceding a single goal.
73',action,"IT STAYED OUT?! Not quite sure how that hasn't gone in! It's Niang and Deeney who link up again, with the former picking out another stunning delivery in for the striker, who slides in to meet it at the far post, but he's miraculously denied by the strong paw of Heaton! Stunning stuff from the Burnley keeper!"
71',action,"BETTER! That's by far the best passage of this second half for the Hornets, as they keep the ball well for an extended period, finally, before breaking down the left. Capoue meets Deeney's cross in the centre, but can't get enough power behind his first-time effort to really test Heaton at the near post."
69',action,"There's just no sharpness to Watford in possession. When they do have the ball they're being held to the periphery, and seem rather content to stay there, while some shockingly misplaced passes have seen them give the ball away cheaply."
67',action,"Watford can afford to be more relaxed given the scoreline and man advantage, but for what it's worth, Burnley have been the better side in this second half. Despite playing down a man, they've shown more quality on the ball and offered a greater threat in attack, while their intensity has been miles ahead of the Hornets."
65',substitution,Substitution sub-out Valon Behrami sub-in Abdoulaye Doucouré . Behrami has had an underwhelming afternoon for the Hornets and he's to be replaced here by Abdoulaye Doucoure.
64',action,"STAT: Burnley have lost only once in their last nine league games against Watford (W3 D5), losing 2-3 in March 2012 at Vicarage Road."
62',action,"Gomes gets a bit rattled at the presence of Ward in the area, which suggests the Clarets are getting in the keeper's head. Successive corners again don't come to anything, however, as Burnley are penalised for a handball. They need two and they're running out of time."
60',action,"Sooner or later Burnley have to make one of these set-pieces payoff. They've looked a consistent threat from them, but the ball has to find its way across the line at one point or they're going to leave Vicarage empty handed."
58',action,"Watford need to be more ruthless. The more they walk through the motions, the more reason Burnley have to feel there's a route back into the game for them. The Hornets need to keep their foot on the throat and press down."
56',action,"CLOSE! Pressure from the 10-man Clarets is starting to mount on the Watford goal, as the hosts show some vulnerabilities in trying to defend set-pieces. Keane proves a nuisance again with the ball in the air, but the spell ends as Brady fires a shot well over the bar."
55',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Andre Gray sub-in Robbie Brady . Gray sees a frustrating match come to an end as he's replaced here by club record signing sub-in Robbie Brady, who makes his Clarets debut."
54',action,"FINE SAVE! Keane does well to climb over his marker to meet a corner, before sending a delightful downward header towards the near post. Gomes sees it late through the crowd, but does well to get down and make the save. That was heading in!"
52',action,STAT: Burnley have won just one point in their 10 Premier League away games this season (W0 D1 L9) and scored just four goals in these matches.
50',action,"Who's there?! Watford use their numerical advantage to catch Burnley short on the flank, with Zarate and Holebas combining well. The latter does well to glance an inviting delivery across the face of goal, but no one gambles to try and meet it at the far post."
48',action,"Not much of anything happening in the early stages of this second half. Watford are patiently trying to keep the ball, while Burnley appear to have had the fight taken out of them a bit following Niang's goal deep in first-half stoppage-time."
46',action,Here we go again!
,action,"Burnley went down to 10 men after just six minutes as Jeff Hendrick received his marching orders for a dreadful and entirely unnecessary challenge on Jose Holebas, and Watford took advantage, as goals from Troy Deeney and M'Baye Niang, both from headers, have the Hornets comfortably in front at the interval, and on course for three points."
45'+3',action,HALF-TIME: WATFORD 2-0 BURNLEY.
45'+2',assist,"Assist José Holebas. Nice piece of quality in the delivery there from Holebas, who picks up the assist."
45'+2',goal,"Goal M'Baye Babacar Niang. ABSOLUTE STUNNER! It's a dream end to the first half for the Hornets, and it's Niang who provides it! The Frenchman runs on to meet Holebas' cross, and from the outer edge of the six-yard box he manages to direct a masterful header all the way in at the far post to double their lead!"
45',action,"FEARLESS BLOCK! Appeals for a handball and a penalty from Watford, but there's no case to be made here as Capoue's strike from 18 yards smacks off the face of Barnes, who admirably got in the way of that effort to protect his keeper. Meanwhile, the board goes up to indicate two minutes of stoppage-time."
43',action,"HE WANTED IT! Zarate with a lovely bit of individual skill as he goes in alone, cutting into the area from the left flank before drifting away from goal a bit to improve the angle. He does everything right there, but just can't produce the required finish, as his strike drifts inches wide of the far post!"
41',action,"A couple times in the last five minutes now, Barton has picked up the ball in midfield with the opportunity to play in Gray with a quality delivery, but he's been unable to do so. The Burnley striker has been, rather predictably given the circumstances, starved of possession in this first half."
39',action,STAT: Troy Deeney has scored in each of his four league appearances against Burnley at Vicarage Road (including today).
37',action,"Shouts for handball as Niang twists and turns his way through the Burnley defence before having a go from the edge of the box. His initial shot is blocked, before coming up and striking the hand of Keane, who knew little about it. The ball returns kindly to the feet of the Frenchman, however, but his follow-up shot is stopped comfortably by Heaton."
35',action,"This really hasn't been all that impressive from Watford over the last 10 minutes. You really could not tell they have been playing with the extra man. It's all a become a bit sloppy and complacent from the Hornets as this half progresses, and now they're in danger of levelling the playing field with three of their own on yellow cards."
33',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Etienne Capoue. Capoue concedes a free-kick and inexcusably loses his cool afterwards, punching the ball on the ground. He picks up an entirely avoidable yellow card as a result."
33',action,"GOOD EFFORT! It's the right foot of Barton that takes, from a position that perhaps may have been better suited for a left-footer. Nonetheless, the midfielder strikes it well, but it winds up drifting back a bit much towards the centre, which allows Gomes to get a hand to it."
32',action,"That's poor from Behrami, who goes into the back of Boyd just outside the box, awarding Burnley a free-kick in a very threatening position, 20 yards out. Prodl had it covered, too, which makes Behrami's intervention all the more unnecessary."
30',action,"Decent spell from Burnley here as they at least manage to alleviate the pressure on their backline for a few minutes. A miscue from Heaton nearly sees the keeper gift Watford a break, but the Clarets manage to get across the halfway line once again and win a free-kick."
28',action,STAT: Only one team in Premier League history has been relegated with 29 or more points after 23 games – Norwich in 1994/95. It has therefore never occurred when the Premier League has comprised 20 teams.
26',action,"It's going to remain a very tough ask for Burnley to come away with anything here today, but if they are to have a fighting chance, they have to be more decisive and positive in possession. Their best route into attack could be down that right flank, running at Holebas, who isn't far away from a second yellow."
24',action,"TIDY STRIKE! Zarate hardly has to move a muscle as the ball falls kindly to him at the edge of the box. The debutante lines up a strike and smacks a well-hit volley at goal, but it's too central as Heaton manages to make a simple stop."
22',action,"DELICIOUS HIT! Deeney and Niang are forming quite the tandem up top for the Hornets! Another clever bit of link-up play sees the latter teed up for a strike, unleashing a cannon with his favoured left, but Heaton rises to the occasion, managing to parry over the bar!"
20',yellow-card,"Yellow Card José Holebas. That's a high one! Holebas only has eyes on the ball as gets his foot up to try and control a loose ball and winds up catching Barton in the face. It looks a bit of a nasty one, but in all fairness the full-back knew little about it, thus manages to escape with a yellow, despite incessant cries from the Burnley supporters to get him sent off."
18',action,"STAT: Since a 3-3 draw at Newcastle in January 2015, Burnley have netted only eight goals in 19 away Premier League games and never more than once in that time."
16',action,"Watford are in complete control here as they work the ball around smartly in the attacking half, keeping Burnley pinned into defence. There's really an excellent width to the Hornets in possession, which has allowed them to keep the ball in these advanced positions as they prevent Burnley from playing so compact."
14',action,"This is more like it from the Clarets, as they manage to settle down and organise themselves a bit better here. They've shifted into what looks like a 4-4-1 formation, which means Gray will likely be isolated a bit up top, but he will have to keep his cool, put the work in and stay disciplined. If he can do that, the chances should come eventually."
12',action,"This is a carbon copy of Watford's start against Arsenal, where they also scored after 10 minutes through Younes Kaboul. They added a second in the 13th minute as well, so Burnley better hold onto their hats here."
10',goal,Goal Troy Deeney. WATFORD TAKE ADVANTAGE! It sure didn't take long for the 10-men of Burnley to concede! Niang pulls up on the right and floats in a marvellous left-footed cross and Deeney does expertly to drift off the back shoulder of Lowton and head home at the far post! Dream start for the Hornets here at Vicarage Road!
10',assist,Assist M'Baye Babacar Niang. Niang picks up the assist for his tidy cross. That's a yellow and an assist inside of 10 minutes for the ex-Milan winger.
8',action,STAT: This is the first ever top-flight meeting between Watford and Burnley at Vicarage Road.
6',red-card,"Red Card Jeff Hendrick. BURNLEY DOWN TO 10 MEN! Unbelievable! Less than 60 seconds after Niang goes into the book, Hendrick says well look what I can do! The Burnley midfielder lunges into a terrible challenge with his cleats showing, catching Holebas quite clearly midway up the shin. That could have broken the full-back's leg! Full credit to Oliver, who was perfectly positioned, and didn't hesitate to pull out the red."
6',yellow-card,"Yellow Card M'Baye Babacar Niang. Reckless stuff from Niang, whose high pressure proves costly as he's issued a very early yellow card by referee Michael Oliver for absolutely clattering Ward, sliding through the full-back and sending him hard to the ground."
3',action,"Very cagey start here at Vicarage with possession exchanging hands early and often. The ball has largely remain contained in the midfield third thus far, on what is an absolutely gorgeous Saturday afternoon in Watford."
1',action,"AND THEY'RE OFF! Watford attacking left to right, wearing their yellow tops and black shorts as they get us underway, with Burnley in claret and light blue."
,action,"Sean Dyche makes just one change from Tuesday's victory over Leicester, as Scott Arfield replaces the injured Steven Defour. Club record signing Robbie Brady and fellow January recruit Ashley Westwood could make their debuts off the bench."
,action,"Walter Mazzarri makes two changes from the victory over Arsenal on Tuesday. Miguel Britos is suffering from a minor hamstring injury and is relegated to a spot among the substitutes today, with Jose Holebas taking his place in the side. Meanwhile, after serving his ban, Mauro Zarate makes his Hornets debut after arriving in January, starting in place of Daryl Janmaat."
,action,"SUBS: Flanagan, Vokes, Brady, Robinson, Westwood, Gudmundsson, Tarkowski."
,action,"BURNLEY (4-4-2): Heaton; Lowton, Keane, Mee, Ward; Boyd, Hendrick, Barton, Arfield; Barnes, Gray."
,action,"SUBS: Britos, Success, Doucoure, Janmaat, Watson, Okaka, Arlauskis."
,action,"WATFORD (4-3-3): Gomes; Cathcart, Kaboul, Prodl, Holebas; Capoue, Behrami, Cleverley; Zarate, Niang, Deeney."
,action,CONFIRMED TEAM NEWS:
,action,"The Clarets’ home form is what will keep them afloat and competing in the Premier League for another season, in all likelihood, but Sean Dyche absolutely has to find a way to correct their struggles away from home to get them to the level they want to be at."
,action,"Burnley have won five straight at home and seven of their last eight, but they’re away from the friendly confines of TurfMoor today, where they have lost six straight and nine of their last 10."
,action,"Walter Mazzarri’s outfit remain eight points off the bottom, but they’re entering a tricky spell as each of their next five league matches come against teams above them in the table, including trips to Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge, which puts added importance on picking up maximum points from winnable matches like this."
,action,"Watford ended a dreadful run of seven successive defeats with a famous victory at Arsenal in midweek, which should provide a massive boost of confidence for the Hornets as they try an avoid being dragged into the relegation scrap."
,action,"Hello and welcome to live coverage from Vicarage Road as Watford, queuing up for a place in the top-half of the table, host a Burnley side aiming to put their road woes behind them!"
