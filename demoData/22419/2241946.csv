,action,"That's all from us here at St Mary's Stadium, thanks for joining us and we hope you'll be able to join us again soon."
,action,"West Brom end the year with a superb win away from home thanks to Hal Robson-Kanu’s wonderful strike on his first Premier League start for the club, after Matt Phillips had cancelled out Shane Long’s first half opener."
,action,Full-time: Southampton 1-2 West Bromwich Albion
90'+2',action,"Rodriguez gets half a yard of space inside the box after clever skill from Boufal, but Dawson slides across superbly well to block the left-footed shot!"
90'+1',action,"There’s going to be a minimum of four minutes of added time here, but Southampton really don’t look like causing West Brom too many problems."
89',yellow-red,"Yellow/Red Virgil van Dijk. Van Dijk is sent off!! Phillips loops the ball down the line and Rondon uses his strength to get to the ball ahead of van Dijk, before the Southampton captain pulls him to ground leaving Mike Jones very little option but to show him a second yellow card."
85',action,"The home crowd are starting to lose patience with their side here, with a few boos ringing around as Ward-Prowse takes too long on the ball before passing backwards to van Dijk."
82',action,"Claude Puel throws his arms in the air as the referee awards West Brom a goal-kick instead of a corner to his side, but the Southampton manager is becoming increasingly frustrated by his side’s performance too."
80',action,CLOSE! Nearly a huge error from Foster who scuffs his clearance straight into Romeu and the ball bounces back past the West Brom goalkeeper but wide of the right-hand post. That could have gone anywhere though!
77',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Sofiane Boufal. Signs of frustration starting to show for Southampton here as Boufal, who’s not had nearly as big an impact in the second half as he did in the first, is booked for pulling back Yacob."
75',substitution,Substitution sub-out Rhu-endly Martina sub-in James Ward-Prowse . A double change now for Southampton as Josh Sims and sub-in James Ward-Prowse come on in place of Tadic and Martina.
75',yellow-card,Yellow Card Craig Dawson. Dawson becomes the latest player to go into the book for a mistimed lunge on Long close to halfway.
74',action,"Wonderful footwork again from Phillips to cut inside two Southampton defenders on the left-hand corner on the penalty area, but once again the end product is poor and his shot goes comfortably over the bar."
72',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Hal Robson-Kanu sub-in José Salomón Rondón Giménez . Tony Pulis is perhaps just taking a precaution with his third substitution now as Robson-Kanu, who’s committed a couple of fouls since being booked, is replaced by Salomon Rondon."
71',action,"McQueen gets into a dangerous position on the left-hand edge of the penalty box, but his cross is a poor one and goes straight into the side netting."
68',action,"West Brom are sitting pretty deep and look happy for Southampton to have the ball here, but the home side are really struggling to create any meaningful chances from open play."
66',action,"Yoshida gives the ball away to Phillips inside his own half but the winger ignores the support flooding forwards and goes for goal from 30 yards out, but can only fire his effort high over the bar."
65',action,"Romeu picks out Martina on the right who has acres of space to pick out a teammate, but his cross is a poor one and is easily intercepted at the near post by Yacob."
62',action,"More boos from the home crowd now as Boufal goes down just outside the West Brom penalty area and Mike Jones waives play on. Boufal doesn’t seem too pleased with the decision either, throwing his arms in the air as he gets to his feet."
60',action,Things just starting to get a bit scrappy now as Tadic gets a talking to from referee Jones following a coming together with Brunt. Boufal then fouls Dawson unnecessarily drawing boos from the home fans.
57',action,"Good save from Forster! Morrison involved almost straight away as he directs a header towards the near corner from a good Phillips cross, but Forster is positioned well to keep the ball out and keep the score at 2-1."
53',substitution,Substitution sub-out Nacer Chadli sub-in James Morrison . West Brom are also making a change as sub-out Nacer Chadli is replaced in midfield by sub-in James Morrison.
52',yellow-card,Yellow Card Hal Robson-Kanu. Robson-Kanu has been shown a yellow card for hitting McQueen on the back off the head off the ball. It was only a gentle tap but he was perhaps lucky to escape a red there.
52',substitution,Substitution sub-out Pierre-Emile Højbjerg sub-in Jay Rodriguez . Claude Puel is making his first change now Højbjerg is replaced by sub-in Jay Rodriguez.
52',action,Close from Boufal! Southampton look to get straight back into the game as Boufal cuts inside onto his right foot and curls a dangerous effort from 20 yards out just wide of the far post with Foster well beaten.
50',assist,"Assist Matt Phillips. Having scored the first, Phillips provides the assist for West Brom’s second goal with a perfectly weighted through ball for Robson-Kanu to run onto."
50',goal,"Goal Hal Robson-Kanu. GOOAAAALLLLLLLLLLL!!!! WHAT A GOAL FROM ROBSON-KANU!!! Phillips plays a lovely through ball for Robson-Kanu to chase, and having got on the end of it he unleashes a fierce left-footed drive from the edge of the area which flies into the top corner!!"
48',action,"Hojbjerg makes a good run down the left and looks to play a one-two with Boufal, but the midfielder doesn’t get on the end of the return pass from Boufal and appeals to the referee that he was pulled back, but Mike Jones isn't interested."
46',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Allan Romeo Nyom sub-in James McClean . West Brom have made one change at half-time, with sub-in James McClean replacing Nyom, which looks as though it will mean Brunt dropping back to left-back."
46',action,Kick-off! West Brom get the second half underway.
,action,"Despite taking the lead Claude Puel may be slightly concerned by his side’s inability to create chances from open play, and may well turn to Jay Rodriguez or James Ward-Prowse on his bench in the second half, while Tony Pulis will be asking for more of the same from his side who defended well for the majority of the half."
,action,It’s all square here at St Mary’s after a half in which very little happened for the first 40 minutes. The half then came to life though as Matt Phillips cancelled out Shane Long’s opener within two minutes of the Southampton striker giving his side the lead.
,action,Half-time: Southampton 1-1 West Bromwich Albion
45'+1',action,"Somehow the ball stays out!! There’s a mad goalmouth scramble from the resultant free-kick with van Dijk and Boufal both stabbing the ball towards goal, but eventually it loops up into the grateful arms of Foster and West Brom survive!"
45',action,"The home crowd are calling for Nyom to be sent off now as he brings down Martina close to the corner flag having been booked earlier in the half, but Mike Jones settles for just a warning!"
43',assist,"Assist Hal Robson-Kanu. It was a clever pass from Brunt to send the ball towards Robson-Kanu, and the Welshman did extremely well to flick the ball on to Phillips while off balance."
43',goal,"Goal Matt Phillips. GOOOAALLLLLLL!!!!! West Brom are level almost immediately!! Yacob plays the ball into Brunt 25-yards out from goal, and the midfielder flicks the ball first time towards Robson-Kanu who flicks it on to Phillips, and the winger cuts inside onto his right foot before firing a low shot into the bottom corner from 15 yards out."
41',assist,Assist Dušan Tadić. It was Tadić who won the corner initially before putting in a superb cross fro Long to head home.
41',goal,Goal Shane Long. GOOOAALLLLLL!!!!! Shane Long scores his first league goal of the season to give Southampton the lead! Tadic swings in a left-footed corner from the right-hand side and Long gets across Nyom at the near post to head the ball high past Foster!
38',action,Robson-Kanu draws the foul from Romeu after van Dijk had given the ball away inside the West Brom half. There didn’t appear to be too much in that challenge though.
36',yellow-card,Yellow Card Allan Romeo Nyom. Nyom follows van Dijk in going into the book for a foul on Martina on the right-hand side. Tadic swings in the resultant free-kick but once again it’s a poor one and easily cleared by West Brom.
34',action,"Hojbjerg has space to line up a shot from the edge of the area and his effort appears to deflect out for a corner off Brunt, but referee Jones points for a goal-kick, much to the displeasure of the home fans."
32',yellow-card,Yellow Card Virgil van Dijk. Van Dijk becomes the first player to be booked for bringing down Robson-Kanu as the Welsh striker looked to break away. The Southampton centre-back was put in a difficult situation then after making a surging run forwards only for Boufal to give the ball away cheaply.
29',action,"Boufal is involved in just about everything going forward for the home side here, this time turning Dawson inside out before picking out Tadic just inside the West Brom area, but the winger’s shot is well blocked, bouncing through safely to Foster."
28',action,Claude Puel just starting to show his frustration at the amount of time West Brom are taking over goal-kicks and throw-ins now but you feel that frustration might be partly due to his side’s lack of chances so far.
26',action,"Close from McQueen!! Tadic puts in a poor free-kick from the right but Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg manages to get to it first and flicks it towards McQueen on the edge of the box, but the left-back drags his left-footed shot wide of the post from 20 yards out."
24',action,"Southampton are just starting to increase the tempo and pressure on the West Brom defence now as Boufal spreads the ball wide to Cuco Martina who has space on the right-hand side, but his cross is too high and Foster can catch it with ease."
21',action,Close!! Boufal does superbly well to combine with Sam McQueen and win the ball back from Matt Phillips on the left-hand touchline before driving a low cross right across the face of goal. Foster lets it run and it just evades Long before rolling wide of the far post.
19',action,"West Brom nearly gift Southampton an opportunity as Evans is tackled by Tadic just outside his own penalty box, but fortunately for the centre-back the ball breaks straight to Long who’s in an offside position and the flag goes up."
17',action,Southampton are seeing plenty of the ball here but aren’t showing any signs of breaking this West Brom defence down yet with Darren Fletcher and Claudio Yacob sitting just in front of the back four.
14',action,"West Brom only half clear a Southampton corner and it drops to Tadic who hits an ambitious first-time volley towards goal from 25 yards out, but it’s not hit with a huge amount of conviction and Foster can watch it go tamely wide of the post."
13',action,"Boufal is dropping deep to get on the ball as much as possible here but West Brom are well organised in defence and limiting his options, this time forcing him to roll the ball backwards to van Dijk."
11',action,"The ball breaks to Boufal 25 yards out from goal in the centre of the pitch and the winger goes for goal with his left foot, but can only blast the ball high over Ben Foster’s crossbar."
8',action,"Boufal gets down the outside of Craig Dawson on the left and looks to get a cross in towards Long, but Jonny Evans gets across well to help his full-back out and block the cross. It’s been a bright start from Southampton without creating any real openings so far."
5',action,The Southampton players aren’t too happy with referee Mike Jones now as he stops play following a foul from Robson-Kanu inside the Southampton half as there appeared to be a chance for the home side to break away had he played an advantage.
3',action,"Shane Long gets in behind the West Brom defence down the right-hand side of the penalty area after a clever through ball from Dusan Tadic, but Boufal is the only Southampton player in the box and Long fails to find him with a low cross."
1',action,Robson-Kanu brings the ball down on his chest on the edge of the Southampton penalty area but is penalised by referee Mike Jones for a push on Maya Yoshida in the build-up.
1',action,Kick-off! Southampton get the game underway.
