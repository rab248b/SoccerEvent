,action,"FULL-TIME! Spurs scrape a 2-1 win over Burnley at White Hart Lane, with goals from Alli and Rose doing just enough for the hosts. The away side opened the scoring through Barnes, but Dyche's men were competitive enough to remain in the equation until the very end. A much-needed victory for Pochettino, with his home form proving to be key so far this campaign. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+4',action,"Vokes is picked out by a curling cross from the right-hand side by Gray, but the Welsh substitute can't quite stretch to get on the end of it! Lloris is very grateful to see the delivery sail straight into his gloves untouched."
90'+2',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Matthew Lowton. Gray is able to race forward on the break, but Wanyama hooks a clearance away from the Burnley striker. Spurs respond with a counter of their own, with Lowton booked for ending it with a cynical challenge on Kane."
90',action,There are four minutes of stoppage time in the second half at White Hart Lane.
89',action,"Sissoko drifts in from the left, but Lowton makes a timely tackle, with Spurs kicking on and deciding that the best form of defence is to push on and attack. Davies then shoots from range once again, but the substitute is denied by a block."
88',action,"Kane sparks a break for Spurs, with Sissoko racing down the right on the break. He opens play out to Winks, who picks out Davies, before a lay-off into Son results in the South Korean substitute rattling a close-range shot off Lowton and behind for a corner. The resulting set-piece is curled in by Eriksen, but Lowton clears."
86',action,"Keane makes a good tackle to kick-start a break for the away side, with Burnley still searching for a way back into this game. A Kightly cross is deflected by Winks, before a delivery from Arfield is charged down too. Dyche's men need to put some quality service into the penalty area. Gray shoots over from a tight angle."
84',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Dean Marney sub-in Steven Defour . Defour is given the last five minutes or so to impress for the away side, with Marney taking his leave."
83',substitution,"Substitution sub-out George Boyd sub-in Michael Kightly . Kightly is introduced for the dying moments, with Boyd taking his leave after an all-action defensive performance on the right-hand side of the Burnley midfield."
83',action,"Over the top from Davies! The ex-Swansea left-back is given the chance to drive infield from the left, but can then only smash a poor effort straight out of play for a goal-kick. No quite what Rose managed to do before going off with an injury concern."
82',action,"We're into the last 10 minutes, with Spurs trying to hold onto the ball and ease their way towards the finish line. Eriksen tries to pick out Son with a neat throughball, but Mee makes a timely interception. Pochettino's men have seen much more of the ball in this second half."
80',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Ashley Barnes sub-in Sam Vokes . Barnes is replaced by Vokes late on, with the Wales international providing more of a target for Burnley to hit with long passes upfield."
80',action,"Kane shoots wide! The England international is picked out at the back post by Walker, but fires a left-footed effort terribly beyond the near post under pressure from Lowton. Spurs could do with another goal just to put this home win beyond doubt."
79',action,"Sissoko has been a real threat down the right-hand side, with the Frenchman doing well since coming into the fray. Burnley look for Gray over the top, as Barnes pings forward a hopeful pass, but Lloris is the sole benefactor. Son is then the target of a similar foray forward from Spurs, with Heaton able to gobble up the scraps."
77',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Danny Rose sub-in Ben Davies . Davies comes in at left-back for the potential match-winner, as Rose is taken off as a precaution."
76',action,"Barnes goes down in the penalty area, claiming for a penalty, but the referee isn't interested at all. If the Burnley striker hadn't been so physical all afternoon, maybe the official would have more sympathy. Spurs race down the other end, but Son shoots wide of the far post after a good pass from Sissoko."
75',action,"Lloris fails to deal with a looping free-kick delivery into the box, punching just half-clear. The rebound is sent looping towards the Spurs net, but the ball thuds down onto the roof of the net. Nervy moments at White Hart Lane."
73',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Bamidele Alli sub-in Heung-Min Son . Alli is replaced by Son for the last 20 minutes, as the Englishman has faded slightly in recent minutes."
71',assist,"Assist Moussa Sissoko. Sissoko makes a telling contribution after coming into the game, teeing up Rose to find the back of the net."
71',goal,"Goal Danny Rose. GOOOOOOOOOAL! ROSE MAKES IT 2-1! This time, the potential provider turns goalscorer. Sissoko is the man to tee up the England international, who rattles home a great finish. Heaton can't get near it this time, and Spurs late with around 20 minutes left on the clock."
70',yellow-card,Yellow Card Moussa Sissoko. Sissoko gets a booking for catching his man late in the middle of the park.
68',action,"Dyche is out on the edge of his technical area barking out instructions, with Burnley just committing men forward when they know that they can overload certain areas of the field. Sissoko has tried to get involved since coming into the fray, but Rose and Walker continue to be the hosts' key men."
66',action,"Kane has been quiet in the second half, with Spurs unable to build up any kind of momentum. Lloris hasn't had much to do either, since the restart, but things are getting a little bit nervy for the home fans. Barnes and Gray combine on the counter for the away side, but Dier charges down a cross from the latter brilliantly."
64',action,"Eriksen cuts infield from the left onto his right foot, forcing Heaton into a brilliant save low down to his left-hand side! The Danish midfielder took aim with a thumping effort, but the England international goalkeeper gets a very strong wrist behind the ball. Mee reacts first to clear Burnley's lines."
63',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Moussa Sidi Yaya Dembélé sub-in Moussa Sissoko . Sissoko is introduced for the final half an hour, as Dembele is replaced. That might be precautionary, given that the Belgium international only just returned from injury."
62',action,"Ward bends in a delivery from the left, but a looping header from Barnes is gobbled up by Lloris ahead of Gray and Marney. Moments later, Alli takes aim from range to try and test Heaton, but a curling right-footed effort sails just beyond the top-right corner. Whiskers away from making it 2-1 to Spurs."
60',action,"Dier whips in a cross from deep on the right-hand side, but Keane rises well to head clear at the near post, with Burnley forced to lump aimless clearances forward in an attempt to give their back four some respite. Lowton tries to deliver for the visitors, but Wanyama is present to head clear, as both teams continue to trade similar blows at White Hart Lane."
58',action,"Burnley are sitting very deep indeed, with Boyd and Arfield helping out defensively throughout. Gray and Barnes are looking a bit isolated up top, with any counter-attacks requiring Dyche's midfield options to really put the effort in to get up in support. Spurs are piling on the pressure."
56',action,"The first 10 minutes of this second half have seen both teams have their moments, as Spurs continue to sit in a precarious position. Pochettino's men are seeing more of the ball and creating more opportunities, but one error from the hosts will give Dyche's side a huge chance to take home at least a share of the spoils."
54',action,"Rose dips in a delivery from the left, but once again Heaton is off his line in a flash to gobble up the ball. Burnley race down the flank on the break, with Gray found in behind Dier, but the hosts' centre-back slides in to shepherd the ball back to his goalkeeper. Burnley claim for a penalty, but the referee isn't interested. Spurs counter, with Rose finding Eriksen in the area, but the Denmark international heads straight at the goalkeeper."
52',action,"Heaton does well to claim another good cross, with Rose and Walker marauding forward with regularity this afternoon. Burnley have been very much on the back foot since the restart, with Gray only getting a fleeting opportunity to threaten on the counter-attack. Dembele leads the charge for the hosts, but Keane steps out of the visiting defence to halt the Belgian's progress."
50',action,"Eriksen has a go! The Denmark international takes aim after opening his body up from 35 yards out. The ex-Ajax man's shot dips on its way towards goal, and shaves the roof of the net on its way behind for a goal-kick. Very close!"
48',action,"Eriksen opens play out to the right-hand side, before Spurs are patient and find Rose on the opposite flank. The ex-Sunderland man tries to bend in a cross, but Burnley clear, with a quick break upfield then ended by Vertonghen. The hosts are immediately looking to dominate this second half."
46',action,"We are back underway at White Hart Lane! Spurs will be wondering how they haven't been able to turn a few good opportunities into their second goal of the night, so the hosts should come out with all guns blazing to battle to victory."
,action,"HALF-TIME! Burnley will be pleased to head into the interval with the scoreline at 1-1, courtesy of goals from Barnes and Alli. Pochettino won't be happy at all, despite his team growing into the half gradually, but there is plenty of time for the hosts to seal themselves three much-needed points."
45'+4',action,"Marney goes down with an injury problem, after colliding with Rose, but the Burnley midfielder is fine to continue. Spurs win themselves a corner, which is cleared by Mee. The away side spark a break, which sees Gray look for Boyd on the left flank, but Walker recovers to get in between the winger and his own goal."
45'+2',action,"Dyche is looking rather concerned at the end of this first half, as Arfield is forced off the field after receiving some treatment. Rose gets down the left and clips a cross back from the byline, with Wanyama found on the edge of the box. The ex-Saints midfielder shoots, but Heaton gobbles it up easily."
45',action,"Dembele finds Rose overlapping down the left-hand side, but a cross is eventually ushered out by Arfield. There are four minutes of stoppage time in this first half, owing to a few injuries."
43',action,"Burnley will be very happy to get into the half-time break level, as they haven't created too many opportunities this afternoon at all. Spurs were slow to get going, and Kane is getting the service required to ask a few questions of Mee and Keane. Walker tries to scamper down the right on the overlap yet again, but Arfield tracks back to make a challenge."
41',action,"Kane goes close! The English striker is fed in behind the Burnley defence, before shooting from a tight angle! The ball threatens to go through Heaton's legs, but it deflects off the goalkeeper's heel and wide of the right-hand post. Almost a big error from the visiting shot-stopper."
40',action,"Rose is fouled by Marney, after hauling back the left-back when he was in full flight. Eriksen and Rose stand over it, but the former's eventual delivery is nodded behind by Barnes for a corner. Spurs continue to earn themselves plenty of set-pieces, but Pochettino's side are yet to really trouble Heaton. The England international goalkeeper hasn't had much to do at all."
38',action,"Barnes will need to be careful, as the Burnley striker has been involved in some afters with Vertonghen. The ex-Ajax defender is penalised for colliding with his opponent off the ball, but neither of them are angels! Arfield bends in a wonderful free-kick delivery from the right as a result, but Keane can't quite rise correctly to nod home a headed attempt."
36',action,"Kane is found racing forward on the overlap, but again the Spurs striker is denied by Mee! The Tottenham forward hesitates and moves the ball from his right foot and onto his left, before seeing a low drive blocked by a sliding tackle. Pochettino's men aren't moving with purpose into the final third."
34',action,"Over the top from Alli! Winks finds Walker out on the right-hand side, and the full-back uses a nice piece of skill to beat Arfield. After providing the assist for Spurs' first, the defender drills in another cut-back, but this time the goalscorer clips a poor effort over the crossbar. Burnley respond with a break, but a flick-on from Barnes is claimed by Lloris."
32',action,"Rose is found overlapping down the left-hand side, but a low cross from the Englishman is blocked by Keane. Eriksen was threatening to get on the end of the delivery, but the deflection off the ex-Manchester United centre-back is gobbled up by Heaton. That's a bit better from Spurs, when they get their full-backs involved in advanced areas they can stretch Burnley."
30',action,"There is another stoppage in play, as Vertonghen and Barnes clash heads. This game has been broken up regularly by fouls and misplaced passes, in what has been a fairly strange start at White Hart Lane. This one might be decided by whichever team make more errors, as Spurs look rather out of sorts."
28',yellow-card,Yellow Card Ashley Barnes. Barnes gets a yellow card for diving in late on Dembele. The Austrian forward scythed down his opponent and the Belgium international is not happy with that whatsoever.
27',assist,"Assist Kyle Walker. Walker advances down the right, before sending a great cross in towards the penalty spot. Alli reacted first."
27',goal,"Goal Bamidele Alli. GOOOOOOOOOOAL! ALLI LEVELS THINGS UP! Spurs take a long while to work the ball out to the right-hand side, with Walker drilling in a low cross. Alli gets there first and slots a neat finish into the bottom-right corner. The two involved in that goal have made up for their terrible starts."
25',action,"The away side haven't just sat back and congested their own defensive third since taking the lead, as Spurs are allowing their opponents to have a bit of possession. Pochettino's men look a little worried, with the home fans starting to get on their players' backs. Grumbling and groaning at White Hart Lane already."
23',action,"Burnley now have a lead to defend, and the hosts have really struggled to get themselves in leading positions on the road in the Premier League this season. A Spurs mistake was required to get them the opportunity, but now Dyche's system and style of play should come into its own. Spurs are immediately looking to get forward and reply, but Alli's take an awful touch and surrenders possession."
21',goal,"Goal Ashley Barnes. GOOOOOOOAL! BARNES MAKES IT 1-0! The visitors have scored only their second away goal of the season, with Spurs giving possession away criminally. Winks and Walker fail to clear their lines on the right flank, with the away side immediately putting a cross into the box. Barnes is present to slide in and poke a close-range finish into the back of the net!"
20',action,"Dembele manages to earn his side a free-kick, as Marney clips the Belgian's heels, with Spurs showing a bit more quality in the midfield third at present. Burnley are remaining organised and compact, with Barnes and Gray forced to come quite deep to help out their midfield four. After giving away a few early chances, Dyche will want his team to tighten things up."
18',action,"There is a break in play, as Alli receives some treatment on his foot. The Englishman was caught by a slightly naughty challenge from Lowton, but does appear to be okay to continue after getting some extended attention."
17',action,"Winks stings Heaton's palms! The young midfielder shoots from within a congested penalty area, but the Burnley goalkeeper is grateful to see the ball rocket straight into his grasp. Spurs have been looking dangerous so far, with the hosts moving upfield with real pace and intent. Alli has gone down with an injury, and needs treatment, however."
16',action,"Burnley threaten down the left, with Ward threatening to get beyond Walker, but the English right-back stands firm and makes a timely tackle which is mopped up by Dier. This game has been very even and open so far. Kane tries to shoot from the edge of the box, after turning well, but the ex-Norwich striker's shot is deflected behind by Mee."
14',action,"Rose drills a shot at goal from the edge of the penalty area, but the England left-back's effort is deflected behind for another Spurs corner. Wanyama meets the set-piece delivery with a tame header that falls to Alli. The former MK Dons midfielder shoots from a tight angle on the right, but can only hit the foot of the near post!"
12',action,"GREAT SAVE! Gray is picked out by a great cross from the left-hand side, after a marauding run from Ward. The Irishman picks out his teammate, and the Burnley striker fires a close-range effort at goal, but Lloris saves well with his feet. Dyche will be wondering how Gray didn't put that beyond the French goalkeeper to make it 1-0."
11',action,"Rose tries to whip a cross in from the left-hand side, but it is only half-cleared by Burnley. Eriksen is given the chance to chest down and volley the rebound goalwards, but Keane heads the danger behind ahead of Heaton. The hosts take the corner and find Eriksen on the edge of the box again, but the ex-Ajax midfielder drills a terrible shot a long way wide of the left-hand upright."
9',action,"Kane battles his way to the left byline, getting beyond Lowton with a neat change of pace, but a drilled cross from the England international flashes across the face of goal and wide of the back post. Eriksen was there and could have gambled, but it didn't appear that the Dane had faith that Kane would deliver a dangerous cross!"
8',action,"The hosts continue to enjoy the lion's share of possession, with Gray and Barnes not pressing too intensely at all. Walker tries to overlap down the right for Spurs, but Arfield is there to deny the Englishman. Moments later, Tottenham attack, but Mee makes a good block to deny a cross from Walker, with Kane then seeing a close-range shot charged down by Keane."
6',action,"Barnes tries to lead a break for the away side, but Winks covers across to foul the Austrian forward. Both teams have been guilty of looking a little bit scrappy in midfield thus far at White Hart Lane. A long, aimless pass forward from Mee sails straight through to Lloris at the other end."
4',action,"Spurs are happy to retain the ball and play their way out from the back, with Burnley sitting deep and packing the midfield in the early stages. Dyche's men will definitely play on the back foot, as their away form in the Premier League has been terrible this campaign. Marney tries to release Boyd down the right, but the ex-Hull midfielder's pass heads straight out of play."
2',action,"It appears to be a 4-3-3 for the home side this afternoon, with Wanyama the only central midfield sitting deep. Dembele and Winks have more license to get forward. Kane releases Alli down the left-hand side, but the England international then cuts onto his right foot and curls an awful effort high and wide of the target. Awful attempt, but Rose and Kane linked up brilliantly to release him in behind."
1',action,"We are underway in the first half at White Hart Lane! The formbook suggests that Spurs should be confident heading into this clash, but Burnley have been able to match the majority of teams that they have faced this season. Dyche's men have been goalshy on the road, but starting with two strikers could change that."
