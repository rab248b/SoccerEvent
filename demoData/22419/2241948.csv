,action,"Tottenham will be disappointed at their inability to pick up a clean sheet, but they nonetheless deservedly leave Vicarage Road with a well-deserved win that lifts them up to third place in the table. They were all over Watford from start to finish and never looked like losing, with Kane, Alli, Son and Eriksen all constantly causing problems for the hosts' back line. Watford are now without a win in their last four games and face what could be a tough clash away to Stoke City on Tuesday evening."
,action,FULL-TIME: WATFORD 1-4 TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR
90'+3',action,"Another great opportunity for Watford! The hosts fly forward on a wonderful attack as Deeney charges down the right flank on a marauding run. He then fires a dangerous bouncing cross into the heart of the box and towards Ighalo, but it's sent slightly too far in front of his strike partner and, as a result, he's unable to reach it."
90'+1',goal,"Goal Younes Kaboul. GOAL! Watford have pulled one back! The home side win themselves a free-kick over on the left wing, and it's fired into a great position in the middle of the box. The Tottenham defence fall asleep and fail to deal with the danger, allowing Kaboul to pop up at the far post and poke the ball over the line, despite Lloris' best efforts."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be three minutes of added time.
88',action,Doucoure loses out in the middle of the pitch and allows Davies to quickly fire a pass into the path of Janssen on the edge of the Watford penalty area. The Dutchman does well to meet the ball but is quickly dispossessed by a wonderful sliding tackle from Prodl at the vital moment.
86',action,"Almost a chance for Sinclair! Deeney breaks down the right flank and fires a cross into the middle of the Tottenham box that Lloris does well to catch. However, he quickly spills the ball under pressure from Sinclair and sends the ball trickling towards goal, but the referee immediately blows his whistle and awards a free-kick to the visitors."
84',action,"Watford quickly win themselves a free-kick of their own that's flung into the Tottenham penalty area and towards Kaboul, but the defender is unable to pick out a teammate with his volleyed pass at the far post. It's easily collected by Lloris but nonetheless results in ironic cheers from the home side."
83',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Craig Cathcart. Cathcart flies into Janssen and brings the striker crashing to the ground with a hefty challenge, resulting in a yellow card for the defender and a free-kick for Tottenham over on the left wing. The set-piece initially fails to result in a chance on goal before falling to Dier, who unleashes a rocket of a shot from 25 yards that flies several yards over the top of the crossbar."
81',action,"Son twists and turns on the right-hand side of the Watford box before trying to play a quick one-two with Winks, but the latter's poked pass back into the penalty area is slightly overhit and misses the South Korean before rolling out for a goal-kick."
79',action,"Vital touch by Gomes! Son gets himself into a good position deep down the left wing before firing a low cross towards Janssen at the far post, but Gomes does well to get a hand on the ball to push it away from the Dutchman and out of the penalty area."
79',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Etienne Capoue sub-in Christian Kabasele . Meanwhile, sub-in Christian Kabasele has come on to take the place of Capoue for Watford."

77',action,"Another chance for Son! Once again, the South Korean links up well with Eriksen before this time managing to get a shot away from the edge of the box, but his strike is slightly too powerful and fails to hit the target. That's not the first chance that he's failed to take this afternoon."
76',action,"Great tackle by Doucoure! Tottenham break forward on a quick counter-attack before Son charges into the right-hand side of the Watford penalty area, but he's immediately put under pressure by Doucoure and loses out to a well-timed tackle from the Frenchman."
75',substitution,Substitution sub-out Nordin Amrabat sub-in Jerome Sinclair . Amrabat is unable to make a full recovery and hobbles off the pitch to be replaced by sub-in Jerome Sinclair.
73',action,"Amrabat tries to break past Wanyama in the middle of the pitch before being caught on the back of the ankle by the Tottenham midfielder, resulting in him immediately falling to the floor. He looks to be in serious discomfort and doesn't want to continue, despite it looking as if his manager is reluctant to bring him off."
71',action,"Kane comfortably skips past Kaboul deep down the right flank before cutting inside and trying to tee up Wanyama, but the pass is sent slightly too far in front of the midfielder is can only find Doucoure on the edge of the penalty area."
69',action,"A lofted lofted pass forward from Wimmer finds Son in a great position inside the Watford penalty area. The South Korean does well to bring the ball down before taking on Mason, but the young defender stands tall and shows great determination to dispossess the forward."
68',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Danny Rose sub-in Ben Davies . Meanwhile, Tottenham have brought on sub-in Ben Davies to replace Rose."
68',substitution,"Substitution sub-out José Holebas sub-in Brandon Mason . Watford have made their first change of the game, with Holebas making way for sub-in Brandon Mason."
67',action,"It's all Tottenham at the moment but, unsurprisingly, they don't seem to be in a great hurry to push forward. The game was as good as won at half-time and has become even more of a certainty since Alli made it 4-0, with Watford failing to get anywhere near the visitors' penalty area."
65',action,"Holebas is put under pressure by Trippier and trips the Tottenham wing-back near to the corner flag, resulting in the latter crashing to the ground painfully. He initially looks to have a problem with his shoulder but is able to get back to his feet after receiving medical treatment for a few moments."
63',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Sebastian Prödl. Prodl charges into the back of Son as the two players battle for the ball on the halfway line and ends up catching the South Korean on the back of the foot, resulting in him becoming the second player to receive a yellow card."
61',substitution,Substitution sub-out Bamidele Alli sub-in Harry Winks . Alli receives a rousing round of applause from the visiting fans as he makes his way off the pitch to be replaced by sub-in Harry Winks.
60',action,"Dier charges forward before firing a lofted pass up towards Alli on the edge of the Watford penalty area. The midfielder brings it down well before unleashing a quick shot that's deflected over to Kane, but the striker is unable to control the ball and loses out to Kaboul."

56',action,"Great save by Gomes! Kane steps up and fires a low, bouncing shot towards the bottom right-hand corner of the net, but Gomes does well to get a hand on the strike to tip it round the post and out for a corner."
55',action,"Capoue charges into the back of Rose and brings the full-back crashing to the ground dangerously close to the Watford penalty area, resulting in a free-kick for Tottenham in an advantageous position. Can the visitors make it count to pile further misery on the home side?"
53',action,"A lofted pass forward finds Deeney, who quickly nods the ball down to Ighalo. The Nigerian then bursts into the Tottenham box before spinning round Trippier and shooting, but there's too much power behind his shot and it fails to hit the target."
52',action,"What a chance for Son! Kane muscles his way along the edge of the Watford penalty area before teeing up Son with a poked pass into the box, but the South Korean is put off by Cathcart and ends up firing his close-range strike well wide of the near post."
50',action,"Almost a chance for Deeney! Doucoure, who has struggled this afternoon, does well to dart into the right-hand side of the Tottenham penalty area before teeing up Deeney, but, with his back to goal, the latter is unable to spin and shoot and instead loses out to Eriksen."
48',action,"Guedioura pushes forward down the right flank before desperately trying to get Deeney into the game with a looping cross over to the back post, but it's completely overhit by the midfielder and sails over the striker's head and out for a goal-kick."
46',assist,"Assist Harry Kane. Kane showed great determination to hassle Kaboul before setting up Alli, but, once again, Watford were all over the place at the back, with all five of the hosts' defenders looking flat-footed and disorganised."
46',goal,"Goal Bamidele Alli. GOAL! What a start by Tottenham! Kaboul loses out to Kane over on the right wing and allows Kane to fire a bouncing cross into the Watford penalty area. It's easily able to find Alli, who is left all alone in front of goal and can comfortably slot the ball under the body of Gomes and into the back of the net to make it 4-0."
46',action,And we're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"It's been a bruising first half for Watford, who can have few complaints about heading into the break three goals down. They've barely been able to push into the Tottenham half of the pitch let alone have a chance on goal, resulting in the visitors bossing possession throughout. Rose and, in particular, Trippier have caused plenty of problems down the flanks, with Kane proving to be a real handful for the Cathcart, Prodl and Kaboul, all of whom have struggled."
,action,HALF-TIME: WATFORD 0-3 TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR
45'+1',action,"Alderweireld loses out on the halfway line and allows Watford to try and push forward, but the hosts are unable to do so quickly enough before the referee brings an end to what has been a miserable opening 45 minutes for the Hornets."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be just one minute of added time.
44',yellow-card,"Yellow Card José Holebas. Watford are presented with a chance to push forward down the left wing but are unable to do so due to strong defending by Tottenham. Eriksen is easily able to win the ball back from Holebas before trying to break forward, but the Greek defender catches the midfielder with a late challenge and receives a yellow card as a result."
43',action,"It's all Tottenham at the moment as they continue to boss possession inside the Watford half of the pitch. Deeney and Ighalo have barely had a sniff on goal, as every time the home side are able to get on the ball, they're almost immediately dispossessed by the visitors."
41',goal,"Goal Bamidele Alli. GOAL! Alli makes it 3-0! A bouncing cross from Kane should be easily dealt with by Kaboul but is instead poked straight to Alli, who pounces on the ball ahead of Cathcart before slotting a shot past Gomes and into the right-hand corner of the net. The nightmare goes on for Watford!"
39',action,"Son almost makes it 3-0! Kevin Wimmer charges forward on a marauding run down the left wing before being clumsily tripped over by Catchart, gifting Eriksen with a great opportunity to curl a cross into the Watford penalty area. The Dane does so and finds Son, but, somehow, the South Korean's close-range effort rolls just wide of the near post."
37',action,"Almost a chance for Deeney! Watford win themselves a free-kick in the middle of the pitch after Amrabat is fouled from behind by Wanyama. It's fired into the box and pinballs around the penalty area before a clumsy attempted header from Alderweireld flies over to Deeney at the far post, but Kane is there to cut out the danger with a vital interception."
35',action,"Ighalo, who has barely had a touch of the ball thus far, is finally able to pick up possession after latching on to a curling cross from Amrabat, but his headed effort is sent well away from goal before the linesman's flag is eventually raised for offside."
33',assist,"Assist Kieran Trippier. Once again, Trippier was left in far too much space by the Watford defence. The wing-back has been brilliant thus far, with Holebas too often finding himself out of position whenever the Tottenham man has the ball at his feet."
33',goal,"Goal Harry Kane. GOAL! It's 2-0 to Tottenham! Trippier is left in acres of space over on the right flank, allowing him to control the ball before firing in a brilliant volleyed cross. Prodl and Cathcart are too slow in trying to deal with the pass, allowing Kane to burst through the middle of both of them before beating Gomes once again."
31',action,"Alli easily muscles his way through a sea of yellow shirts before chipping a lovely pass into the path of Kane, but just as the striker is about to test Gomes with another close-range shot, Prodl sticks out a foot to stop him from doing so."
29',action,"Kane causes problems for the Watford defence once again as he charges towards the hosts' penalty area. He then quickly picks out Alli, who is in a great position to his right, but the midfielder is unable to add his name to the scoresheet and instead sees his shot blocked by Capoue."
27',assist,"Assist Kieran Trippier. Trippier's pass to set up Kane was a wonderful one, but questions have to be asked of Holebas, who left Kane completely unmarked, and Gomes, who was beaten far too easily at his near post."
27',goal,"Goal Harry Kane. GOAL! Tottenham have taken the lead! Eriksen and Trippier link up well deep down the right wing before the latter threads a great through-ball past Holebas and into the path of Kane. The striker is completely unmarked and only has Gomes to beat, and he's easily able to do so with a clever side-footed finish."
26',action,"Alli hits the crossbar! Tottenham come back once again before Alli unleashes yet another thumping strike from long-range, and this time it easily beats the outstretched limbs of Gomes before ricocheting off the woodwork. What a goal that would have been!"
25',action,"Fierce strike by Eriksen! The Dane is starting to find an increasing amount of space around the edge of the Watford box and quickly tries to beat Gomes from 20 yards out, but his effort rises slightly too high and flies just a yard or so over the top of the crossbar."
24',action,"Toby Alderweireld pushes into the Watford half of the pitch and lifts a lovely lofted pass towards Dier, who is in a great position in front of goal. The defender decides not to test Gomes and instead tries to nod the ball down to Kane, but Capoue is there to dive in front of the striker and cut out the danger."
23',action,"What a chance for Rose! Eriksen cuts inside from the right wing and picks out Rose with a clever pass across the edge of the Watford box, but the left-back's thumping first-time strike has too much power behind it to trouble Gomes and ends up rising a few yards over the top of the crossbar."
21',action,"Jose Holebas and Younes Kaboul do well to dispossess Dele Alli on the edge of the Watford penalty area before the latter thumps a lofted pass up towards Troy Deeney. The striker does well to bring the ball down before trying to spin and find Ighalo, but Dier stays close to him and pokes the ball away at the vital moment."
19',action,"Tottenham are slightly sloppy on the ball inside their own half of the pitch and gift possession to Capoue in a dangerous position, but the Frenchman is unable to pick out Abdoulaye Doucoure with his quick pass forward and instead sends it rolling into the hands of Lloris."
17',action,"Adlene Guedioura does well to muscle Rose off the ball before trying to kick-start a swift counter-attack with Capoue, but the pair are quickly closed down by white shirts before Son dispossesses the latter."
15',action,"Rose, who has looked bright during the game's opening exchanges, gets himself into a good position over on the left flank before cutting inside and picking out Kane, but the striker is unable to curl a long-range shot into the top right-hand corner of the net and instead sends it a few yards wide of the goal."
13',action,"Amrabat embarks on a rare foray down the right wing as he tries to carve out a first chance on goal for Watford, but his pass forward fails to find Ighalo and ends up trickling into the hands of Hugo Lloris."
11',action,"Tottenham scream for a penalty, but nothing is given! The visitors keep pushing forward and work the ball nicely around the edge of the penalty area. Rose eventually fires a low cross towards Eriksen, who then unleashes a rocket of a shot that's deflected off Etienne Capoue and out for a corner. Both the Dane and Kane are adamant that the ball hit the midfielder's hand, and the replays seem to indicate that it did."
10',action,"Wanyama muscles his way through the middle of the pitch before doing well to pick out Kieran Trippier in acres of space down the right flank, but the defender is unable to pick out Harry Kane and sends his cross over the head of the striker."
9',action,"Eriksen's cross from the corner is a good one, but it's unable to find a white shirt in front of goal and is instead headed away for a throw-in by a towering headed clearance from Craig Cathcart."
8',action,"Rose is caught by a late challenge by Amrabat, and Tottenham win themselves another free-kick in an advantageous position. This time they send it short and quickly work the ball forward to Victor Wanyama, who then tries to take on Sebastian Prodl before settling for a corner."
6',action,"Heung-Min Son finds himself in a pocket of space in the middle of the pitch and links up well with Eriksen before testing Gomes from 25 yards out, but his low shot lacks the power needed to beat the Brazilian goalkeeper."
4',action,"Odion Ighalo twists and turns deep down the left wing before trying to skip into the Tottenham Hotspur penalty area. He does well to beat two players and then takes on Eric Dier, but the latter comes out on top with a well-timed tackle."
2',action,"Danny Rose charges down the left wing before being tripped over by Nordin Amrabat, resulting in a free-kick for Tottenham in a dangerous position. Christian Eriksen steps up and whips a looping cross into the middle of the box, but Heurelho Gomes is there to punch the ball away."
1',action,"And we're off! Watford get us underway, attacking from right to left."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out on to the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."
,action,"Zuniga has just hobbled off injured in the warm-up, meaning that Odion Ighalo will have to start in his place. It looks as if Capoue will drop back into the centre of midfield, with Amrabat operating as a right-wing-back."
,action,"Meanwhile, Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino has also made four alterations to the team that featured in their last outing, with Kyle Walker, Jan Vertonghen, Mousa Dembele and Moussa Sissoko making way for Kieran Trippier, Toby Alderweireld, Kevin Wimmer and Heung-Min Son."

,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"Mauricio Pochettino may have been given a headache by injuries and suspensions, but he will no doubt be pleased with his side’s recent performances. Tottenham have won all of their last three Premier League games, with Southampton the most recent to fall, and another victory here today will move them above Manchester City and, temporarily, fierce rivals Arsenal."
,action,"Despite their struggles, Watford are facing Tottenham at a potentially advantageous time. Their opponents today will be without Jan Vertonghen and Kyle Walker - both of whom are suspended - whilst Toby Alderweireld has only just returned from injury. As a result, this afternoon could prove to be the day that Watford score their first goal from open play since December 10th."
,action,"Watford’s recent difficulties have been compounded by their struggles in front of goal, as they’ve only managed to score four times since beating Leicester City midway through November. Etienne Capoue remains his side’s top goalscorer this season with five goals, whilst main striker Troy Deeney finally ended his two-month drought with the all-important equaliser against Crystal Palace on Boxing Day."
,action,"An unbeaten October helped Watford climb up to seventh place in the table, equal on points with Manchester United, but life has been slightly tough for the Hornets since then and they now find themselves in 12th, 14 points behind Jose Mourinho’s men. Just one of their last six games has ended in a victory, with four of those resulting in frustrating defeats."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Premier League game between Watford and Tottenham Hotspur at Vicarage Road.
