Davies laid the ball through to Coleman, who took a great first touch and then lifted the ball over Hennessey and into the back of the net."
85',action,"Great piece of defending from Williams, to block the run from Schlupp and see the danger pass. The Palace winger looked like he was throw on goal and ready to take a shot, however Williams did very well to deny him. Schlupp is now down injured, looks like cramp."

19',action,"Another Hennessey save to deny Everton the opening goal! It was good play by Everton down the left flank, the ball came into the box which Romelu Lukaku held up and laid the ball off on the edge of the area to Barkley who fired a powerful shot at goal. However it was straight at the Palace keeper who tipped the ball over the bar."
16',action,ANOTHER EVERTON CHANCE! This time it is a great save from Wayne Hennessey to deny Mirallas from the six-yard box who had chested the ball down and then struck a volley at goal. The Welsh international had to get down to his right very quickly to make a good stop!
15',action,"CHANCE EVERTON! Ross Barkley goes closest to opening the scoring for Everton. The midfielder dribbles past a couple of Palace defenders with ease before unleashing a fierce shot at goal which goes narrowly over the bar, after a slight deflection."
