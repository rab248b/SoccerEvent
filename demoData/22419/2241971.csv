,action,"That's all for our live coverage, thanks for following along. Goodbye!"
,action,"Goals from Diego Costa and Gary Cahill late in each half see the Blues extend their lead atop the Premier League table to a seemingly impregnable eight points. It was far from comfortable, but it's job done in the end for Antonio Conte's side."
90'+4',action,FULL-TIME: CHELSEA 2-0 HULL.
90'+2',action,"Both teams have switched off, accepting the inevitable result here. The tempo has gone as Chelsea pass it around patiently, waiting for the clock to run out."
90',action,There will be four minutes added on for injuries and stoppages.
89',action,"This is a crucial result for Chelsea when you look ahead at their next two league fixtures, away to Liverpool and home to Arsenal. A slip up here today and their lead at the top would all of a sudden have started looking a bit more penetrable."
87',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Diego Da Silva Costa sub-in Michy Batshuayi Tunga . Costa goes off to a stirring ovation from the home fans, replaced by Michy Batshuayi for the final minutes."
85',action,"It should be signed, sealed and delivered now for Chelsea, who are playing looser once again. It's going to appear a routine victory for them on the scoresheet, but it's really been anything but this evening against a plucky Hull side."
83',action,"STAT: Chelsea are unbeaten in their nine Premier League meetings with Hull (W7 D2), keeping six clean sheets in the process."
81',assist,Assist Francesc Fàbregas i Soler. Fabregas is off the bench and into the scoresheet with an assist.
81',goal,"Goal Gary Cahill. THAT SHOULD SEAL IT! Cahill's header is tucked in at the far post, but that was all in the quality of the delivery from Fabregas, following a good bit of skill from Willian to win the free-kick. What an impact from the two Chelsea substitutes!"
79',action,"This has the feel of a game where Chelsea might just need a second goal. They certainly could use the breathing room for their own peace of mind, because it's shaping up to be a tense finish at Stamford Bridge, on what could be the perfect weekend for the Blues - otherwise it will be an opportunity missed."
77',action,"At the risk of patronising Hull, this has been a very intrepid and unflinching display from them. They've come up against the league leaders, on their turf, and are really taking it to them in this second half. You almost feel like they deserve a reward at this point."
75',substitution,Substitution sub-out Abel Mathías Hernández Platero sub-in Adama Valentin Diomande . Hull's third and final change sees Adama Diomande come on to replace Hernandez.
73',action,"STAT: Hull's only previous Premier League goal at Stamford Bridge was in August 2009, Stephen Hunt giving the Tigers the lead before eventually losing 1-2."
71',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Pedro Eliezer Rodríguez Ledesma sub-in Willian Borges Da Silva . Willian also enters the fray, at the expense of Pedro."
71',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Eden Hazard sub-in Francesc Fàbregas i Soler . A double switch here from Chelsea, the first of which sees Cesc Fabregas replace Hazard."
69',action,"Moses flings his arms up in the air rather recklessly to block Robertson's cross from coming through, which gifts Hull a free-kick out wide. The ensuing delivery is too deep, however, before Niasse's ambitious effort from a difficult angle sails miles over the bar."
67',action,"The Tigers are playing with a real discernable sense of belief here. This has been by far their best spell of the match, spurred on by the Davies substitution, which prompted a switch to a more standard back four. Niasse is also proving a good outlet on the right."
65',action,"Hull are continuing in the ascendency, as these Chelsea supporters begin to grow a bit restless. The league leaders are ahead, but it's all been rather pedestrian, if not uninspiring, from them this evening."
63',action,"This second half has been devoid of any real attacking quality. In fact, it's Hull who have produced the two best moments on the front foot since the restart, with Meyler's shot and Hernandez's penalty shout - maybe just a reason for them to believe here."
61',action,STAT: Victor Moses is the seventh different player to assist Diego Costa in the Premier League this season. It was his first Premier League assist at Stamford Bridge since May 2013.
59',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Curtis Davies sub-in El-Hadji Baye Oumar Niasse . Oumar Niasse, who made his home debut last weekend against Bournemouth, comes on to replace the injured Davies."
58',action,"Play resumes without Davies, as Hull don't have a substitute prepared yet. This is proving a bit of a nightmare for Marco Silva, who's being forced into a second change of the match as a result of injury."
56',action,"Davies has a problem now for Hull, as he goes down with what appears to be a hamstring injury, before signaling over to the touchline as if to indicate he needs to come off."
54',action,"Courtois called into action for a second time this evening! He hasn't been the busiest of keepers, but that's two important saves now, this one to deny Meyler's effort from just outside the area."
52',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Andrew Robertson. Robertson, who has a horrid time trying to track Moses on the flank, puts in a late challenge to take the wing-back to ground, earning a yellow card and conceding a free-kick in a decent area for Chelsea to whip in a cross here."
50',action,"STAT: At 51 minutes and 35 seconds, Diego Costa's is the latest 1st half goal since Opta started recording exact times (2006-07)."
48',action,"Decent penalty shout! Alonso puts in a really needless intervention on Hernandez inside the area after the ball had gone. It had no effect on the play, but it was a foul and it came inside the area, so he's very lucky not to have conceded a penalty there."
46',action,Here we go again...
,action,"Stern resistance and sound organisation from Hull at the back is broken deep in stoppage-time by Diego Costa, as Chelsea's persistence pays off. Hull will feel hard done by, as there appeared to be a foul on Abel Hernandez by Gary Cahill in the build-up, but they only have themselves to blame as they had a more than a few chances to snuff out the move between the non-call and the goal."
45'+9',action,HALF-TIME: CHELSEA 1-0 HULL CITY.
45'+7',assist,Assist Victor Moses. Moses provides the assist.
45'+7',goal,"Goal Diego Da Silva Costa. DEEP IN ADDED TIME, CHELSEA LEAD! Moses makes a delightful run down the right flank and somehow manages to thread a low cross through a crowd of bodies, straight to the feet of Costa in the centre, and he's never going to miss from there!"
45'+6',action,"NEARLY THERE! Alonso finds space out wide and flashes in a delightful low cross, which only needed a touch from Kante! The midfielder can't meet it, however, as it arrives safely into the hands of Jakupovic."
45'+4',action,"That's a wasted opportunity by the Blues, as Pedro's delivery from the free-kick doesn't have the pace needed behind it to really test the Hull defence."
45'+3',action,"Davies is a lucky boy! He lunges into a challenge on the very edge of the box, clearly taking out Pedro and none of the ball. It's a free-kick for the Blues, and a stern talking to for the Hull centre-half, who is already on a yellow. That was likely his final warning."
45'+1',action,The board goes up to indicate nine minutes of stoppage-time at the end of this first half. No real surprise there.
44',action,"FINE SAVE! It's Hull who negotiate the best chance of the match thus far, with Maguire stinging the palms of Courtois from just over 20 yards! He got all of that strike, did the Tigers centre-half, and what a shock lead that would have been."
43',yellow-card,Yellow Card N'Golo Kanté. A hard foul on the halfway line sees Kante into the book. Three yellow cards handed out here so far in the first half.
43',action,"While we're nearing the 45th minute, there should be a lot more time added on at the end of the half, considering the lengthy stoppage following the Mason injury. The game was brought to a halt for nearly eight minutes before play restarted, so it will be interesting to see if they're all accounted for."
41',action,"Hull are in no hurry whatsoever to get the ball forward when they win it back, and Chelsea aren't looking particularly keen to get at them, either. There's just no real flow to this match in the first half, which has proved tedious viewing from a neutral standpoint."
39',action,It remains tough sledding for Chelsea in attack. There's simply not been enough movement off the ball to open up lanes for passes to come through. The bulk of their possession has been away from the danger areas.
37',action,"Well for all of Chelsea's dominance in possession, they've been limited to just the one shot on target thus far. It's been a virtual walk in the park for Jakupovic, though the same can't be said for his defence, who have worked fervently to protect him."
35',action,"STAT: Pedro has been directly involved in more Premier League goals this season (10, 5 goals, 5 assists) than the whole of last season (9 - 7 goals, 2 assists)."
33',action,"Appeals for a penalty as Pedro goes down in the area, but he doesn't win the decision from Swarbrick, who has a good look before pointing towards the corner flag. Luiz was up there as well, and his unexpected presence really seemed to throw off the Hull defence."
30',action,"Pressure is starting to build again on the Hull defence. They're being pegged back here, unable to win it back, and sloppy with their passing when they do get the chance to break. The noise level is starting to increase again, after an extended period of quiet in the stands."
28',action,"Mason's injury has, understandably, sucked the life out of this match. It's really struggled to get going again, with Chelsea doing their best to increase the tempo, but to no real avail as of yet."
26',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Curtis Davies. This isn't shaping up all to well for Hull, who now have two of their three centre-backs on a booking as Davies is shown a yellow card."
25',action,"It's always a tough thing for these players, especially from a Hull perspective, to carry on after that sort of scene. Mason is in the best hands possible, so all they can do at this point is try and maintain their focus and get a result for their team-mate, which, of course, is easier said than done."
23',action,"STAT: Eden Hazard needs one more goal to reach double figures in the Premier League this season, something he's done twice before (14 goals in 2013/14 and 2014/15)."
21',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Ryan Mason sub-in David Meyler . A rousing, if not slightly poignant applause echoes throughout the ground as Mason is carried off the pitch. sub-in David Meyler comes on to replace him, and the match is set to resume."
19',action,"Still Mason is on the ground, being prepped. He has the oxygen mask taped to his face, neck secured in a brace, and his legs strapped together. Hopefully all this is simply a precaution, and Mason is healthy going forward."
17',action,"Good work from the medical staff here, who take all the proper precautions as they secure Mason in preparation for lifting him onto the stretcher. It's a lengthy process and one which should by no means be rushed."
15',action,"Cahill is back on his feet, walking off the knock, but Mason remains down in rather ominous fashion. The stretcher is out for him, with an oxygen mask strapped to his face. Somber moments at Stamford Bridge, and you could hear a pin drop at the moment."
13',action,"Scary moments here as Cahill runs on to meet a cross, but winds up clashing heads with Mason. Both players go to ground in a heap, with referee Neil Swarbrick immediately calling towards the touchline for the training staffs to come out."
11',action,"Hull are doing well to keep organised under consistent pressure, at least keeping the hosts to the periphery. The deliveries in from the wide areas have been dealt with accordingly, and they're starting to play with a bit more confidence as a result."
9',action,"STAT: Hull's last league win against Chelsea came in the old second division, winning 3-0 at Boothferry Park in October 1988."
7',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Michael Dawson. Dawson is booked for a bad foul on Pedro - an early and unwelcomed booking for the centre-half, who will be walking a tight line the rest of the way."
5',action,"Chelsea seem keen to build down that right-hand side, with Moses and Pedro particularly lively in the early stages here. It's been one-way traffic, as many would have expected, straight from the off."
3',action,"Expectedly controlled start here from Chelsea, who are playing with the utmost confidence at the moment. They're knocking the ball around at will, playing keep-away from Hull, who are already scrambling a bit off the ball."
1',action,"INCHES WIDE! It takes just 10 seconds for Chelsea to issue a statement of intent, as a long ball over the top from Luiz presents Costa with a chance on the volley, which he flashes fractions wide of the near post!"
1',action,"AND THEY'RE OFF! Chelsea get us underway, attacking right to left."
,action,"The teams are out on the pitch at Stamford Bridge, with kick-off rapidly approaching!"
,action,"STAT: Costa has scored in all three of his previous Premier League appearances against Hull, assisting twice."
,action,"Hull substitutes: Marshall, Meyler, Maloney, Diomande, Niasse, Tymon, Bowen."
,action,"Hull (3-5-2): Jakupovic; Maguire, Dawson, Davies; Elabdellaoui, Mason, Huddlestone, Clucas, Roberston; Evandro, Hernandez."
,action,"Chelsea substitutes: Begovic, Ake, Zouma, Chalobah, Fabregas, Willian, Batshuayi."
,action,"Chelsea (3-4-3): Courtois; Azpilicueta, David Luiz, Cahill; Moses, Kante, Matic, Alonso; Pedro, Costa, Hazard."
,action,"The big pre-match news, however, is that Diego Costa is back in the starting line-up for Chelsea. The striker was dropped for last weekend's 3-0 win over Leicester City amid reports of a bust-up with Antonio Conte and interest from the Chinese Super League. He returns to make his 100th appearance for the club today, and the full line-ups are coming now."
,action,"The Tigers sit just one point off the bottom, but a shock-victory today, which would be a first for them against the Blues in the Premier League, could pull them ahead of Swansea and out of the bottom-three."
,action,"Hull City got the win they so desperately craved last weekend against Bournemouth, just their second since the end of August, but they’re in tough to keep that momentum going today against a Chelsea side firing on all cylinders."
,action,"Liverpool, Tottenham, Manchester City and Manchester United all dropped points yesterday, meaning the Blues can go eight-points clear atop the table in what, at least on paper, appears a very winnable fixture for them."
,action,Chelsea were idle on Saturday but the stars aligned for Antonio Conte and company as results elsewhere have the runaway top-flight leaders poised to increase the gap at the Premier League summit.
,action,Hello and welcome to Stamford Bridge as Chelsea aim to widen their lead atop the Premier League table when they play host to relegation-threatened Hull City!
