,action,"Bobby Madley brings things to a halt at Stamford Bridge, with Chelsea going nine points clear at the top of the table (for now) and securing a record-breaking 13th successive Premier League win in a single season. Stoke gave a good account of themselves at times, but Conte's men simply had too much for them."
90'+3',action,FULL-TIME!
90'+2',action,"Good play by Chelsea as they seek a fifth. Matic's low ball into the area almost finds Chalobah by the far post, but it sails through for a goal-kick instead."
90',action,There will be three minutes added on here.
88',action,"Chelsea are just looking to see things out now. Although they've not been at their very best today, you have to applaud their ability to respond to set-backs."
86',yellow-card,Yellow Card Charlie Adam. Adam is the latest player to get booked after a cynical foul in the middle.
85',goal,"Goal Diego Da Silva Costa. GOAL!!! COSTA WRAPS IT UP! The Spaniard bullies Martins Indi in the area, barging into him while shielding the ball, before spinning and firing past Grant. Excellent play!"
84',substitution,Substitution sub-out Willian Borges Da Silva sub-in Nathaniel Chalobah . Substitution  sub-out Willian Borges Da Silva sub-in Nathaniel Chalobah
83',action,"Poor from Hazard, as his corner delivery fails to beat the first man. The Belgian hasn't had a great day today."
82',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Victor Moses sub-in Branislav Ivanović . Off goes Moses now, with Ivanovic taking his place."
81',action,"Stoke are back on the attack now. They make good ground up the right flank, as Johnson flashes the ball across the face of goal. Crouch looks destined for a tap-in, but Azpilicueta brilliantly gets a toe on it to divert it away."
79',action,"That's a crude tackle from Adam, as he catches Alonso in midfield. He escapes a booking, though."
77',action,"Great play by Hazard, who has been much better in the second half. He darts up the left and feeds Costa into the box, with the Spaniard slicing a left-footed effort just over."
75',action,"Stoke make ground up the right flank, with Diouf getting into the box and seeing a low cross deflected behind by Cahill."
73',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Francesc Fàbregas i Soler sub-in Nemanja Matić . Switch for the hosts now, as Fabregas makes way for Matic, who is one booking away from a suspension."
72',action,Chelsea have done well to keep Stoke quiet in the last few minutes. Conte's men are the ones doing all the pushing here. They are desperate to put this beyond Stoke.
70',yellow-card,Yellow Card Mame Biram Diouf. Diouf joins Alonso in the book just after the Spaniard following their little tussle.
70',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Marcos Alonso Mendoza. Two bookings now, as Alonso and Diouf clash and referee Bobby Madley sanctions both."
69',action,"Willian is everywhere at the moment. He races through the middle and prods a pass through towards Hazard in the box. The pass takes a deflection and comes back to the Brazilian, whose eventual effort is snatched at and it goes well wide."
67',action,"They may already have their lead once again, but Chelsea are still on the hunt for more goals."
65',assist,"Assist Francesc Fàbregas i Soler. Great run and pass by Fabregas, as he releases Willian into the box for his second assist of the day."
65',goal,"Goal Willian Borges Da Silva. GOAL!!! CHELSEA ARE AHEAD AGAIN! Fabregas does well, breaking into the final third and he slips a nice pass into the right side of the box for Willian, who blasts into the top-right corner in emphatic fashion."
64',assist,"Assist Mame Biram Diouf. Great play by Diouf, who offered an outlet and supplied a fine assist for Crouch with a controlled ball."
64',goal,"Goal Peter Crouch. GOAL!!! STOKE ARE LEVEL! Bojan makes an instant impact, as he links with Crouch and then, thanks to a little luck, the ball breaks kindly to him again. He feeds Diouf into the area and he squares across the goal for Crouch to apply an easy finish. What a game."
63',action,"Half chance for Chelsea now, as Moses receives the ball just outside the area and shoots well over."
62',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Ibrahim Afellay sub-in Gilbert Gianelli Imbula Wanga . Afellay's day comes to an end, with the powerful Imbula coming on in his place."
61',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Xherdan Shaqiri sub-in Bojan Krkíc Pérez . First switch for Stoke, as the ineffective Shaqiri comes off and is replaced by Bojan."
59',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Francesc Fàbregas i Soler. That's a naughty tackle from Fabregas, as he takes Allen out a little late and picks up a booking."
57',assist,"Assist Eden Hazard. Brilliant assist for Hazard, as he casually cushions the ball to Willian, who provides a fine finish."
57',goal,Goal Willian Borges Da Silva. GOAL!!!! CHELSEA RESTORE THEIR LEAD! Moses does well out wide and turns Pieters inside-out before fizzing a low ball into the danger zone. Hazard cushions the ball into Willian's path and his slams a left-footed effort beyond the helpless Grant.
57',action,"Now Hazard threatens, as he pops up in the right side of the area behind Martins Indi and smashes the ball across the face of goal, only for Johnson to hack it clear."
56',action,"The free-kick is worked short and Moses picks it up on the right flank. His cross is well blocked, though."
55',action,"Shawcross is lucky to escape a booking there, as he crashes into Costa who had already beaten him with a lovely touch."
54',action,"Excellent play by Costa. He receives a clever pass into the area by Hazard, before darting between two defenders and drilling the ball low and hard into the danger zone. Grant does well to push it away, though."
53',action,"Fabregas' free-kick delivery is poor, but he gets another stab with a corner, which is better. Grant punches it clear as far as Moses, who manages to tee Willian up on the edge of the area and his controlled shot goes just wide."
51',action,"Clumsy tackle by Shaqiri, as the Swiss star barges into Kante and sends him tumbling towards the left flank."
50',action,"Things briefly look encouraging again for Stoke, as Adam wins an aerial 50/50 and then passes to Crouch, but his attempt to find Shaqiri gifts possession back to Chelsea."
48',action,"Chelsea are straight back on the attack and Willian causes panic in the Stoke defence, before sending a low drive just wide of the bottom-right corner."
46',goal,"Goal Bruno Martins Indi. GOAL!!! STOKE ARE LEVEL! Within a minute of the re-start the visitors restore parity. Adam's fine free-kick delivery finds Crouch, who heads across the face of goal and Martins Indi steers into the bottom-left corner."
46',action,Off we go for the second half.
,action,"Referee Bobby Madley brings the first half to a close at Stamford Bridge, with Chelsea 1-0 up. Stoke began quite brightly and made themselves a threat, but the hosts got to grips with them and probably just about deserve to be ahead. Plenty more to come from this in the second half, though."
45'+1',action,HALF-TIME!
45',action,There will be a minute added on here.
43',action,"Fabregas' delivery is blasted towards the back post towards Luiz. Diouf gets to it and heads away, before finding himself barged in the back by Luiz."
42',action,"Another free-kick for Chelsea now, this time by the left corner of the penalty area. Fabregas stands over it. Can Chelsea get a second just before the break?"
40',action,"What a waste! Chelsea win a free-kick just outside the Stoke area, but Costa takes charge ahead of Hazard and Willian and sends his effort well over. I don't think he'll have a leg to stand on next time after that!"
38',action,"The home side has responded well to Stoke's period of pressure, surviving and then really driving home their superiority. They are well on top at the moment."
36',action,"Chelsea come back for more now, as Moses races forward and then passes to Willian. The Brazilian appears caught in two minds and eventually his effort doesn't appear to be a cross or shot, as the ball rolls behind for a goal-kick."
34',assist,"Assist Francesc Fàbregas i Soler. Excellent corner delivery from Fabregas, laying it on a plate for Cahill."
34',goal,"Goal Gary Cahill. GOAL!!! CHELSEA HAVE THE LEAD! Fabregas' powerful, flat delivery from the corner is thumped in towards the near post and Cahill meets it with an emphatic header which flies past Grant."
33',action,"What a save! Brilliant pass up from the back by Luiz, who finds the run of Costa. He brings the ball down excellently, beating Shawcross in the proces. Grant does well to rush out and get a touch, before then saving sensationally from Hazard's rebound. Corner to Chelsea."
32',action,"Lovely touch from Shaqiri just inside the area, as he controls the ball on his chest and flicks it over Cahill. Luiz is there to clear up, though, as he darts across and then races out to the left."
31',action,Moses hasn't been effective in attack so far. Every time he's come up against Pieters so far he has seen his cross blocked. The Stoke man is winning their duel so far.
29',action,Stoke weather another Chelsea storm and buy themselves some respite as Moses fouls Afellay.
27',action,"Good chance for Stoke! An awkward divot forces Courtois to miss his kick and concede a corner, and Adam manages to meet Shaqiri's delivery with a header. However, his flick-on is too far ahead of Crouch and it goes wide of the left-hand post."
25',action,"Well over! Stoke work the free-kick well, as Adam plays it low towards the edge of the box and Shaqiri peels away, before slicing high over the crossbar."
24',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Victor Moses. Yellow card for Moses now, as the Nigerian tracks the run of Pieters and trips him out near the left corner."
23',action,"Stoke will be relieved to have survived Chelsea's first real period of pressure, but they will want to respond to that spell with some positivity of their own."
22',action,"Good save! The Chelsea corner is floated in towards Cahill in the area and he manages to meet it with a good header which breaks towards the bottom-right corner, only for Grant to palm it away."
21',action,Good pressure from the home side. The initial free-kick is flicked behind by Diouf and Chelsea work the corner across to the opposite flank. Luiz slams a low cross into the box and that is deflected behind again.
20',action,A Stoke corner comes to little and Chelsea dart forward on the break very quickly. Adam then trips Costa about 40 yards from the Stoke goal.
18',action,"STOKE SURVIVE! Fabregas does brilliantly to pick Costa out in the left side of the area. He brings it down on his chest and manages to wrong-foot Diouf who slips. The Spaniard smashes a half-volley goalwards and Grant makes a fine save, before then grabbing the ball again after it deflected back towards him off Martins Indi."
17',action,"Corner for Chelsea now, as Moses runs at Pieters and the Dutchman just gets a touch on the ball to put it behind."
16',action,"Excellent from Allen. Chelsea threaten up the right, as Willian looks to feed Costa. But the Wales international nips in to intercept and he comes away with the ball."
14',action,"Once again Adam produces a fine free-kick delivery from the left flank and causes Chelsea some bother. Luckily for them, though, Azpilicueta slides in just in time to deny Martins Indi a tap-in."
13',action,"Another good opportunity for Stoke here now, as they win another free-kick out on the left after a Moses foul."
11',action,"Azpilicueta is guilty of a cynical foul on Afellay out wide and Adam swings a fine cross in from the resulting free-kick. Both Crouch and Shawcross get close to the ball's flight path, but Luiz makes a vital intervention and then Shaqiri sends an attempted delivery of his own out for a goal-kick."
9',action,"Stoke are showing plenty of attacking intent during these early exchanges. With Crouch up top they have significant presence and they try to cause problems in the penalty area now, as a long ball is aimed up towards the striker. Luiz and Courtois deal with it between them, however."
7',action,"Just wide! Chelsea play the corner short and Kante picks it up on the edge of the box. The crowd urges him to shoot and he obeys their command, poking a 20-yard shot agonisingly wide of the left-hand post. Lee Grant did appear to have it covered, though."
6',action,"Chelsea spring into life, with Hazard unsurprisingly central. He darts in from the left, dribbles past two and then shoots from 25 yards, with his effort deflecting just wide."
5',action,"More good football from the away side, this time as Joe Allen gets forward and prods a clever pass into the left side of the area. But Afellay is then flagged offside for making his run a little too early."
3',action,"A positive start from the visitors, as they stroke the ball around well and get the ball into the box twice in quick succession. Though on both occasions Chelsea clear with ease."
1',action,Off we go! Stoke get us started.
,action,The teams are out on the pitch with kick-off just a few minutes away.
,action,"With Liverpool and Manchester City facing each other later, this is a real opportunity for Chelsea. They go into the match six and seven points ahead of their two title rivals, respectively, and should they draw later Conte's men will end 2016 a whopping eight points better off as long as they beat Stoke here today."
,action,"It's not surprising to see Mark Hughes make changes from that defeat. Ibrahim Afellay gets his first start of the season and partners Charlie Adam in midfield, with Glen Whelan and Gianelli Imbula - both poor against Liverpool - dropping to the bench. There's also a return for Xherdan Shaqiri, as Jonathan Walters misses out with a knock."
,action,"As for Stoke, well their previous impressive run has shown few signs of re-emerging in December. They last won against Burnley on the third of the month, before two draws and two defeats - the latest of which came at the hands of Liverpool at Anfield on the 27th."
,action,There are no other changes in the Chelsea team other than those two alterations and you can hardly blame Antonio Conte for that. Cesc Fabregas deservedly makes his second Premier League start in succession and he was probably the only question mark.
,action,"Last time out Chelsea put on a strong display against Bournemouth, running out 3-0 winners thanks as Eden Hazard, Pedro and Willian inspired them in attack. The Spaniard is the one who misses out today, as his suspension paves the way for Diego Costa to return from his own one-match ban. N'Golo Kante does too, replacing Nemanja Matic."
,action,"Stoke subs: Given, Bardsley, Sobhi, Imbula, Whelan, Bojan, Bony."
,action,"Stoke City starting XI (3-4-2-1): Grant; Johnson, Shawcross, Martins Indi; Diouf, Affelay, Adam, Pieters; Allen, Shaqiri; Crouch."
,action,"Chelsea subs: Begovic, Zouma, Ivanovic, Chalobah, Loftus-Cheek, Matic, Batshuayi."
,action,"Chelsea starting XI (3-4-3): Courtois; Azpilicueta, David Luiz, Cahill; Moses, Kante, Fabregas, Alonso; Willian, Diego Costa, Hazard."
,action,"First of all, let's introduce the teams..."
,action,"Hello and welcome to the live coverage of the Premier League clash between Chelsea and Stoke City. I will be describing the action for you today, as the pacesetters look to take their winning streak to 13 against a side beaten 4-1 by Liverpool just a few days ago."
