,action,It was another poor display from the reigning champions who now have the worst record as champions for over 50 seasons. The defence afforded the Southampton danger men far too much space and Huth and Morgan were out-muscled far too easily at ti mes. Gray and Fuchs were the bright sparks going forward and Albrighton looked hopeful when he came on but the trio were ultimately too wasteful. A deserved win and nothing more than a Sunday stroll for Southampton.
,action,It's full-time here at St.Mary's and it's a much better showing from the Saints as they run out 3-0 winners. Ward-Prowse was the star of the show this afternoon after grabbing the first with a smart finish and assisting Rodriguez for the second with a well worked free-kick. Tadic rounded up the victory making no mistake from the spot. It's a performance that should give Puel's men confidence for their tough run of fixtures coming up.
90'+3',action,Long tries to get on the end of the cross and the Irishmen somehow manages out-jump Leicester's giant centre pairing of Huth and Morgan he gudies it too high and the ball is well over the bar. The Foxes' defence has been far from good enough today and gave the Saints far too much space at times.
90'+1',action,There are set to be four minutes of added time here at St.Mary's and Redmond very nearly just increased the lead. His shot was low and hard at Schmeicel but the keeper held it well. A case of running down the clock for the Saints now.
88',action,Tadic's penalty has out the game behind doubt now and he deserved a place on the score sheet after having a lively afternoon. The Saints are content with three though and search for another as Ward-Prowse delivers it brilliantly with Long catching Simpson and Morgan by surprise but the forward fails to connect properly.
86',penalty-goal,Penalty Goal Dušan Tadić. GOAL! Of course Tadic puts it away. The Serb showed supberb confidence as he struck it high and slightly to the right. Schmeichel did go the right way but was never going to be able to get a hand to it due to the sheer power and height.
85',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Wes Morgan. Under the new laws, Morgan is booked for bringing down Long."
85',action,PENALTY! Morgan brings down Long in the box as the Irishman races onto a ball...
83',action,"The home fans are in fine voice now as look to edge the Saints to the final whistle. This is undoubtedly one of the best performances we've seen from Puel's men in recent games. Leicester, on the other hand, continue to be hapless and Forster has been untroubled for the majority of the game."
80',substitution,Substitution sub-out Jay Rodriguez sub-in Shane Long . Rodriguez makes way for sub-in Shane Long.
80',action,The corner is straight into the hands of Schmeicel and the visitors aim to hit the Saints on the counter but they are well alert and Leicester win a throw for their troubles. We're in the last ten minutes here at St.Mary's and the hosts are still very much in control.
78',action,"The ball spends a lot of time in the air before Simpson brings it down and puts it out for a throw. Rodriguez receives it in the corner and under pressure, gives it Albrighton. He soon wins it back and with the help of Redmond, wins a corner."
75',action,"DISALLOWED! Huth concedes a free-kick in a half decent position and Tadic whips it in. The last man to touch it before it hits the back of the net appears to be Wes Morgan and Southampton wheel away to celebrate but after a discussion with the linesman, it's flagged offside. Yoshida looks like to the offender with his arm offside by a few centimetres at most, no-one in a blue shirt called it and there's no way the linesman could have been certain enough to make such a big call."
73',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Pierre-Emile Højbjerg sub-in Jordy Clasie . Hojbjerg, who is liekly to be disappoinited with his performance this afternoon makes way for sub-in Jordy Clasie as we near the remaining 15-minutes of th game."
72',action,MISS! The ball is straight back into the box and how has Wes Morgan missed Leicester's best chance of this afternoon!? Musa whips the ball in and Huth heads it down for Morgan who fails to connect well with it. That sums up the visitor's afternoon.
71',action,"Romeu has a go after collecting it from Redmond and it's a good effort forcing Schmeicel into a low save. Leicester race away immediately and Gray is able to get away from Cedric with some nice skill. Cedric times a tackle to perfection and takes the ball from Gray, putting it out for a corner which is well dealt with."
69',action,"The Southampton defence clear as only as far as Drinkwater who has a go from long range but again, it's over. Rather than attempting to make something happen in the box, the Foxes seem to shooting from long distance at any opportunity."
68',action,Leicester have it in the Southampton half but just cannot keep possession. Their passes are sloppy and any crosses well wayward. Ndidi hits a cross but it's always going wide and Albrighton prevents any chance of time wasting as he races to the ball and places it down for Forster.
66',action,Southampton take it forward again as they look to put the game beyond doubt. Cedric hits the cross and Rodriguez tries to put over Schmeicel but the Leicester keep deals with it with ease. The Saints are certainly on top.
63',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Shinji Okazaki sub-in Ahmed Musa . sub-out Shinji Okazaki makes way for sub-in Ahmed Musa, can the big money summer signing make things work for Ranieri?"
63',action,"The free-kick fails to be useful and Southampton have a goal-kick. The Foxes need to be less wasteful if they want to get back in the game. If they do lose today, they equal the record for the worst first 22 matches of a season as reigning champions, with only Ipswich doing this in 1963."
61',action,"Ward-Prowse tries to grab his brace from the edge of the box but it's always rising and it sails well over. He's certainly having a lively afternoon and is eager to impress. At the other end of the pitch, Vardy wins a free-kick from Romeu."
60',action,"Leicester aim a free-kick from long range towards Wes Morgan but the captain loses out to Rodriguez. The Saints take it forward and after a poor clearance from Schmeicel and a poor pass from Fuchs, Hojbjerg races goalward to score. He only has the keeper to beat but his poor afternoon in front of goal continues as he puts it wide again. He should do better and should have wrapped the game up, Hojbjerg knows that as he screams in frustration."
58',action,"Marc Albrighton attempts a strike from long range and it's not a bad effort from the substitute. It's on target and dipping straight for the bottom right corner. Despite having the sun in his eyes, Forster is able to hold it well and keep that precious clean sheet, for now."
55',substitution,Substitution sub-out Virgil van Dijk sub-in Jack Stephens . That's the last we'll see of sub-out Virgil van Dijk this afternoon after that knock forces him off and sub-in Jack Stephens replaces him.
54',action,Van Dijk is down again and the ball is only put out once the hosts retain possession which causes the home support to deliver a barrage of boos towards the visitors. The skipper does not look okay and appears to be unable to shake that knock from Vardy off. Worrying for the Saints if they are to lose such a key figure.
52',action,"Okazaki and Fuchs pair up to take it forward, Vardy receives the ball in the corner but Southampton will cut them out all day long. The Foxes have just one goal in their last four games and with their attacking movement this afternoon, it's not hard to see why. Leicester need to improve drastically, champions or no champions."
49',action,"Gray tries to make it happen for Leicester again and after a nice run, he delivers a decent cross by van Dijk cuts it out. The defender appears to be clipped by Vardy as they both go for the ball and is down receiving treatment. Gray is Leicester's bright spark at the moment and whilst the direction of his runs are great, his decision making once near the goal could do with improvement."
47',action,"The first chance of the second-half goes to Leicester. It's a brilliant cross in and Hojbjerg aims it low from just inside the box but is effort is always going wide. Should Leicester concede another they will exceed the number of goals they conceded last season, 36."
46',action,Leicester get us underway for the second-half. The Foxes have been on the field for sometime now and have clearly been given a dressing down by Ranieri.
46',substitution,Substitution sub-out Nampalys Mendy sub-in Marc Albrighton . sub-out Nampalys Mendy is hauled off for sub-in Marc Albrighton at the break as Ranieri appears to ditch the diamond formation and opt for a 4-4-2.
,action,"The host's second came just over ten minutes later after a hell of a free-kick from Ward-Prowse. The set-piece found Rodriguez well and the striker timed his finish to perfection to double his side's lead. The visitor's have been very poor defensively and are failing to mark Southampton's danger men, giving them far too much space. Up-front, Fuchs and Gray look like the only two that will make something happen but the latter has been too wasteful at times."
,action,"Southampton head into the break 2-0 up and deservedly so. The hosts started the game well and failed to put away numerous chances, though what do you expect from a side that has the lowest shot conversion rate in the league. The breakthrough finally came on 26-minutes and it was a great finish from Ward-Prowse who has definitely being the star man of this afternoon."
45'+2',action,The Saints' fans call for a penalty after Huth brings down Rodriguez heavily in the box. Michael Oliver does think about it for a second or two before playing for half-time. A decent 45-minutes from the hosts indeed.
45',action,Simpson is lucky to escape without punishment after grabbing a good hanfdul of Tadic's shirt in the box. Ward-Prowse whips the corner in well but it's well cleared. The goal-scorer and assisstant of the second goal is causing all kinds of problems for the visitors. Who better to do that in front of than the new England manager?
43',action,"Leicester enjoy a good spell of possession in Southampton's half and after giving it away temporarily they do well to win it back. Fuchs, who has been one of the brighter players in a blue shirt, picks out Vardy but the he takes the through ball straight to a red and white shirt. Sloppy from last season's top scorer."
41',action,Leicester try to get themselves back into the game immediately but it's another half chance for Gray. The Foxes are going to need to better than that if they're going to give the hosts a game. The visitors have been lacklustre in every department so far and Ranieri will not be a happy man at half-time.
39',goal,"Goal Jay Rodriguez. GOAL! Southampton double their lead and though it was Jay Rodriguez who got the goal, Ward-Prowse is the man of the moment again. His free-kick pays dividends as he clears the wall and Rodriguez waits it perfectly. The striker catches it perfectly and sticks it past a helpless Schmeicel. A mountain to climb for the reigning champions."
36',action,"The successive corner was always going to Schmeicel's who punches it out. At the other end of the pitch Gray is growing desperate to score and has another attempt but his cross is well cut-out. Perhaps a little too high for the likes of Vardy and Okazaki, particuarly against the likes of a towering van Dijk."
35',action,Tadic shakes off Ndidi as the Saints try to execute another attack. It's on for Bertrand from Tadic but Drinkwater spots it and puts it out for a corner. Ward-Prowse takes and it's headed out for another corner...
33',action,It's another free-kick and Leicester seem to be gaining some momentum at St.Mary's. The set-piece is well clear and the Saints look to race away on the counter after Simpson finds himself in danger by the defender does well to recover.  Ranieri shouts orders to his man on the touchline.
31',action,Gray and Fuchs stand over it and the former takes but it's lashed off the top of the wall and is out for a corner. Perhaps too much of a central hit from the midfielder. The resulting corner is met by van Dijk and the Saints are able to breathe a sigh of relief.
30',action,Okazaki wins a free-kick on the edge of the box after Cedric brings the Leicester man to ground. It's in a promising position for the Foxes. Gray looks like he wants to take...
28',action,Moments later Saints go close to second! Romeu finds himself completely unmarked but his diving header fails to double his side's lead. The hosts are deservedly in front and are now playing the game at a very fast pace as they search for a second.
26',goal,"Goal James Ward-Prowse. GOAL! James Ward-Prowse finds the breakthrough for the Saints and what a finish it is from the midfielder. You can see the joy on his face as he receives the ball just inside the box and hits it first time into the left corner. Gareth Southgate, who is in attendance this afternoon, will be pleased with that. A very confident finish indeed, Ward-Prowse did immensely well to keep it down and a full-stretch Schmeicel just couldn't get to it."
26',assist,Assist Cédric Ricardo Alves Soares. It's a great assist from Cédric who picks out Ward-Prowse well.
24',action,Van Dijk barks orders to his teammates as Southampton use a throw as an opportunity to regroup. That regrouping is short lived however as Okazaki races towards the box and picks out Gray who is beaten to the ball by Cedric. The game is beginning to look more even now after the Saints dominated the opening minutes.
22',action,Redmond looks to find a way through down the right but his plan is foiled by Mendy and Fuchs. The winger grows frustrated and pushes Mendy to grown and Leicester have the free-kick which Schmeicel takes. The visitors certainly look more comfortable defensively after the opening 20-minutes.
19',action,Everything is happening down the left-wing for the hosts but Okazaki is doing his best to make life difficult for them. Moments later the Saints exploit Leicester's diamond formation and Betrand wins a corner after Schmeicel is forced to tip his low hard shot round the post. Leicester clear and Gray shows immense pace to race down the wing and has a go but his shot is rising and Forster is able to gather on his second attempt.
17',action,"Ndidi attempts a shot from 20-yards and it's on target but Forster does his job well. At the other end of the pitch Hojbjerg spots a chance, the ball bounces down for him and he goes for the volley but his shot is wel wayward. Should that have gone in, it would have been some goal."
15',action,"Vardy looks to get away but Forster beats him to the ball and Southampton are able to take it forward before Betrand wins a free-kick just past the halfway line. The Saints take it backwards as they aim to compose themselves. The Foxes win the ball back and it's Gray and Fuchs who link up well again. If anything is going to happen for Leicester, you can bet the pair will be involved."
12',action,"Young star Gray retains posession for the Foxes and after some clever footwork he manages to give it Fuchs who dlivers a nice cross but no-one is able to get on the end of it. Southampton collect the ball and look to hit the visitors on the counter. The attack slows down and despite having four people on him, Rodriguez manages to nip in ahead of Morgan to win the header but his effort is well held by Schmeicel."
9',action,Tadic takes it down the wing and into the box and looks to pick out Rodriguez but Drinkwater matches to intercept. Southampton retain posession and Ward-Prowse looks to get onto the end of delivery but heads it poorly. Hojbjerg collects the loose ball but sees his effort go well over.
7',action,It's Bertrand and Tadic again as they link up well but the latter just over plays the pass and the ball rolls out for a goal-kick. Southampton have definitely found their tempo now and Leicester need to compose themselves before they find themselves trailing.
6',action,"Huth punts it forward but only as far as Ward-Prowse who was lurking on the half-way line. Tadic collects it from his teammate and is yards ahead of his marker Simpson, he whips it in perfectly for Bertrand who has been given far too much space by Fuchs. Fortunately for the visitors, Bertrand's header sails over."
5',action,Bertrand takes it down the left wing and tries a shot from long-range but it's well of target and Leicester have the goal-kick. Not too mcuh to discuss after the first five minutes of this afternoon but Southampton have started the game the brighter of the two. Can Leicester edge their way in?
2',action,"After some moments of uncertainty Leicester are able to breathe. After an early cross from Cedric, Tadic looks to get on the end of it to flick it onto Rodriguez but Schmeicel finally clears on the third attempt and manages to force a goal-kick from Tadic."
1',action,Southampton get us underway at St.Mary's...
,action,"Ranieri has made three changes from the starting 11 that lost 3-0 at home to Chelsea. Marc Albright and Ahmed Musa drop to the bench whilst highly rated youngster Demari Gary and Shinji Okazaki are favoured ahead of them. In defence, Danny Simpson comes in ahead of Benjamin Chilwell who is also dropped to the bench."
,action,Puel has opted to make just one change from the Soutampton side that last 1-0 away to Burnley as Jay Rodriguez replaces Shane Long in attack. The Irish international features on the bench as Puel favours the club’s joint second top scorer this season. Charlie Austin is still on the sidelines after suffering a shoulder injury during his side’s Europe League game against Israeli minnows Hapoel Be’er Sheva in which they exited the competition.
,action,"SUBS: Zieler, Chilwell, Musa, King, Albrighton, Kapustka, Benalouane."
,action,"Leicester: Schmeichel, Simpson, Morgan (c), Huth, Fuchs, Ndidi, Mendy, Drinkwater, Gray, Okazaki, Vardy."
,action,"SUBS: Taylor, Clasie, Long, Martina, Stephens, McQueen, Sims."
,action,"Southampton: Forster, Cédric, van Dijk (c), Yoshida, Bertrand, Romeu, Højbjerg, Ward-Prowse, Tadić, Redmond, Rodriguez."
,action,TEAM NEWS
,action,"Leicester’s form also seems like a million miles away from their fairytale of last season. The reigning champions are in 15th place and a win today could take them as high as 13th. Though that will be a tough task to ask of the Foxes as they are yet to win a Premier League away game this season, drawing three and losing seven. They managed to beat Everton away in the FA Cup and have displayed remarkable form in the Champions League but Claudio Ranieri’s men are finding life in the league difficult."
,action,"Southampton head into this afternoon’s game in dreadful form and should they lose today they will equal the club top-flight record of five consecutive defeats, something which they haven’t done since 1998. The Saints lost their lost outing 1-0 away to Burnley with their last win a 3-1 rout away to Bournemouth in the week before Christmas. Claude Puel’s men crashed out of the Europa League but are still in the FA Cup and League Cup, however, he has reiterated that the league is the priority over cups. Their current form seems a million miles from the Southampton we have seen in previous seasons."
