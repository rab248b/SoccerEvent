,action,That's all from us today folks! Hope you enjoyed the game.
,action,"A clinical away performance by West Ham today, they deservedly come away with all three points. Former Swans player Andre Ayew opened the scoring for the Hammers in the first-half after poor defending from the hosts. Winston Reid then doubled their lead shortly after the half-time break, before Antonio netted his eighth goal of the season to make it 3-0. Swansea then pulled one back through Fernando Llorente, but Andy Carroll then scored West Hams fourth just a minute later to wrap up a 4-1 victory!"
,action,FULL-TIME: SWANSEA 1-4 WEST HAM
90'+3',action,That's the final whistle!
90'+1',substitution,Substitution sub-out Andy Carroll sub-in Ashley Fletcher . Final West Ham substitution as sub-out Andy Carroll is replaced by sub-in Ashley Fletcher.
90',assist,Assist Sofiane Feghouli. Feghouli set up Carroll with an excellent chip to the far post and the striker made sure all three points were heading back to London.
90',goal,Goal Andy Carroll. GOOOAAALLL! WEST HAME MAKE IT FOUR! Andy Carroll fires a volley into the back of the net to dash any small hopes of a Swansea comeback! It was a clinical finish by the forward who has worked hard all game and round off a good performance with a goal.
89',assist,Assist Nathan Dyer. Dyer pulled the ball back for Llorente who fired the ball past the helpless Randolph.
89',goal,Goal Fernando Llorente Torres. SWANSEA HAVE PULLED ONE BACK! Fernando Llorente fires in from the six-yard box after good play by Dyer to make the score 3-1. Surely too late to change the outcome of the game?
87',action,West Ham continue to push forward and still look dangerous. Feghouli was has just entered the game looks eager to get on the score sheet but he is crowded out by the Swansea defenders.
84',substitution,Substitution sub-out Michail Antonio sub-in Sofiane Feghouli . Second substitution for the Hammers with the third goalscorer sub-out Michail Antonio coming off to be replaced by sub-in Sofiane Feghouli.
82',action,"Randolph has been in fine form this afternoon for the Hammers. He has just been forced into making a smart save to deny Angel Rangel from the edge of the box, after good work from Sigurdsson."
80',action,Plenty of Swansea supporters are heading for the exits now as it looks like the Hammers have wrapped up all three points here.
78',goal,Goal Michail Antonio. GOOOAAALLL! IT'S 3-0! Michail Antonio beats the offside trap as he diverts Nordtveit drilled long-range shot into the back of the net. Antonio was completely unmarked in the middle of the box as the Swans centre-backs had moved out but Nathan Dyer is far too slow to push out and Antonio is definitely onside as he nets his eighth goal of the season!
78',assist,"Assist Håvard Nordtveit. Håvard Nordtveit fired a shot at goal which looked to be heading wide, but Antonio was on hand to divert the ball into the net."
77',action,"Excellent play by Payet and Fernandes down the left flank, two quality players are causing the Swansea defenders plenty of problems."
75',substitution,Substitution sub-out André Ayew Pelé sub-in Edimilson Fernandes . First West Ham substitution sees the opening goalscorer André Ayew leave the pitch to plenty of boos from the home supporters. He is replaced by sub-in Edimilson Fernandes.
73',action,Now it is West Ham's turn to attack! Cresswell is in acres of space down the left flank but he fierce ball into the box isn't anticipated by Carroll and Ayew.
70',substitution,Substitution sub-out Jefferson Antonio Montero Vite sub-in Nathan Dyer . Third and final substitution by Swansea as Montero leaves the pitch of a stretcher and is replaced by sub-in Nathan Dyer.
70',action,"SWANSEA CHANCE! Llorente holds the ball up and then does well to chip a ball into the box which is met by Sigurdsson who forces Randolph into a fine save to tip the ball over the crossbar. The resulting corner comes to nothing. This is better from Swansea, as a goal now is crucial."
68',action,"Montero is still down for Swansea here after the coming together with Nordtveit, he is receiving treatment behind the Hammers goal at the moment and it looks like the half-time substitute may be coming off here. Another big blow for Bob Bradley."
66',action,PENALTY SHOUT! Montero tries to beat Nordtveit down the right but his final touch is slightly too heavy and Nordtveit sees the ball out. The Swans supporters appeal for a penalty but it is more in hope than anything. Andre Mariner waves away any appeals.
65',action,As we head into the final quarter of the game here it is the Hammers who have a two-nil lead at the Liberty Stadium. Swansea are finding it difficult to break through this strong West Ham defence.
63',action,"Antonio almost breaks through clear on goal! However Leon Britton does very well to battle back and win the ball cleanly, which was vital has Antonio only had the keeper to beat then!"
61',action,Noble almost makes it three! Excellent work by Payet who lays the ball off to his skipper who tries to curl the ball into the top corner but it is blocked by a Swansea defender. The resulting corner is only partially cleared by the Swans and the Hammers have another this time from the left. However Fabianski rises high and punches the ball well clear.
59',action,STAT: The Hammers have kept a clean sheet in their last two Premier League games - the last time they kept three in a row in the Premier League was back in December 2015.
56',action,"The Hammers look comfortable at the moment and are closing in on a third straight victory here, as Swansea are struggling to create any decent chances which is frustrating the Swans supporters."
54',action,"Couple of corners in quick succession for Swansea here, a good opportunity to get one back? No. Sigurdsson takes a short corner which doesn't work and West Ham easily clear the danger."
53',action,"The Swansea supporters are voicing their discontent at their team's performance and manager Bob Bradley. Not what they need right now, as they have a mountain to climb if they are to get back into this game."
50',assist,"Assist Dimitri Payet. As you would expect from Dimitri Payet, it was a excellent delivery from the corner which was poorly defended by Swansea and Reid capitalised."
50',goal,"Goal Winston Reid. GOOOAAALLL! The resulting corner is converted by Winston Reid to give the Hammers a two-nil lead! The centre-back rises high and gets his head to the ball, despite being under heavy pressure from two Swansea defenders. Reid wheels away in delight and celebrates wildly infront of the travelling supporters."
49',action,Good attack by West Ham ends with Carroll having a shot from the edge of the box blocked and the Hammers have a corner. Payet and Noble linked up well and the latter played the ball into the path of the striker but he takes a heavy touch which allows the Swansea defence to block the effort.
47',action,These Swansea changes will give the hosts more width and pace through Montero and a clinical striker in Llorente is always great target man and threat.
46',substitution,Substitution sub-out Borja González Tomás sub-in Fernando Llorente Torres . Fernando Llorente replaces Borja up front.
46',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Jay Fulton sub-in Jefferson Antonio Montero Vite . The first of the double Swansea substitution, with sub-out Jay Fulton coming off and is replaced by Jefferson Montero."
46',action,Off we go!
,action,The teams are back out here at the Liberty Stadium. Looks like Swansea are making a double change ahead of the second half.
,action,"West Ham lead one-nil at the break here at the Liberty Stadium, thanks to Andre Ayew's first goal for West Ham. It was poor defending by Swansea and Ayew was on his toes and slotted the ball into the back of the net to give the Hammers the lead."
,action,HALF-TIME: SWANSEA 0-1 WEST HAM
45'+1',action,That's the half-time whistle!
45',action,Routledge beats Winston Reid down the left flank and puts an excellent cross into the box which is met by Cork but he can't keep his header down and Randolph watches it sail over his crossbar.
45',action,There will be a minimum of one minute added on here.
43',action,"Now it is West Ham's turn to attack! Almost a clinical counter from the visitors, through Antonio and Payet, however Antonio's curling shot from the edge of the box goes narrowly over Fabianski's net."
41',action,"Swansea have a free-kick in an excellent position, 25 yards from goal and it is Sigurdsson who will take the set piece. Sigurdsson bends the ball around the Hammers wall but Randolph reads it well and makes a fine save to deny him. That's the first real save the West Ham keeper has been forced to make."
39',action,Van der Hoorn comes very close to heading the ball into the back of the net. Sigurdsson pumped the ball into the box and the centre-half gets a glancing header to it but Carroll gets the final touch and makes sure it goes wide. The resulting corner comes to nothing.
36',action,"CHANCE SWANSEA! A great opportunity for the hosts and it falls to Sigurdsson. Rangel again does well down the right and feeds the ball to the Iceland midfielder who tries to open up his body and place the ball into the back of the net, but he doesn't get the contact he would've wanted and it goes well wide of the goal. He would've been better trying to wrap his left foot around it!"
34',action,"Swansea have had just one effort at goal in just over half an hour of action here, despite having almost 60% possession. The Hammers have been more clinical and perhaps the Swans need to be more direct and take a few more risks."
32',action,"STAT: Ayew has scored 13 goals in the Premier League, nine of which have come at the Liberty Stadium. He was destined to score today!"
30',action,This is much better from Swansea. They've got ahold on the ball but West Ham are putting them under pressure high up the pitch and making sure that they don't create any chances at goal.
28',action,"Swansea have a good chance to put the ball into the box, with Sigurdsson standing over a free-kick which was won by Routledge. However West Ham do well to clear the danger and try to mount a counter-attack through skipper Mark Noble but the Swansea defence get back quickly are cut out the attack."
26',action,Brief stoppage in play here as Cheikhou Kouyate is down injured and receiving medical treatment.
23',action,"West Ham look very dangerous here at the moment, Swansea are having to hang on! Antonio did well to find time and space in the box but his low cross is cleared by Mawson. However the Hammers win the ball back almost immediately, this time it is Payet running at the Swans defence and he tries his luck from long-range, but it is straight at Fabianski who gathers well."
21',action,"Despite their current position in the league, Swansea only had three points more after 17 Premier League games of last season (15) than they currently have this season (12) - they ended in 12th place last season."
19',action,"Plenty of discontent in the stands here, as West Ham look comfortable at the moment, getting better as the game goes on. Dimitri Payet has just been allowed far too much time on the left wing to pick out a cross. Ayew flicks the ball on, but it just escapes Antonio at the back post."
16',action,"West Ham are currently dominating possession in the middle of the park at the moment and look the more likely to cause more problems. That West Ham goal was a huge blow to the hosts, it was a scrappy goal and perhaps against the run of play but poor defending allowed Ayew the opportunity to punish them."
13',goal,Goal André Ayew Pelé. GOOOAAALLL! André Ayew scores for West Ham against his old club! Andy Carroll uses his excellent aerial ability to put the ball into the path of Antonio who forces Fabianski to parry the ball away from goal. However his push away was weak and Ayew anticipated well to slot the ball into the back of the net with ease.
11',action,"CHANCE SWANSEA! Borja should've done better! It was superb midfield play by Jack Cork, he lays the ball into the path of Borja who beats a couple of West Ham defenders but delays his shot twice, before then firing the ball well wide of the goal."
10',action,"There is certainly a nervous atmosphere here at the Liberty Stadium, the Swans supporters will be expecting something out of today's game."
8',action,"Decent opportunity for Swansea! Angel Rangel and Borja Baston link up well down the right flank, stretching the Hammers defence and forcing the three centre-backs apart. Borja then whips a low ball into the box which is met by Routledge, but he can't get a good touch to the ball and Darren Randolph collects."
6',action,"Good early pressure here from Swansea. Wayne Routledge does well to win a corner off Aaron Cresswell and give the hosts an opportunity to get the ball into the box. Alfie Mawson gets his head to the ball in, but his effort goes well wide of the goal."
5',action,This is the third occasion that Swansea and West Ham are playing each other on Boxing Day; with the Hammers unbeaten in both previous clashes (winning 3-0 in 1949 and drawing 1-1 in 1933).
3',action,"Neither side has settled into their own rhythm just yet. The Hammers wing-backs are pushing forward at every opportunity, making it almost four up front at some stages. However no chances for either side."
2',action,"Look like Swansea may be lining up with a front three today, Bob Bradley has tinkered with his side today as it is a huge game for the hosts. Three points would be massive for the Swans!"
