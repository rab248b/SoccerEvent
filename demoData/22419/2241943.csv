,action,That's all for us today folks. Enjoy the rest of your evening!
,action,Islam Silmani's header on 20 minutes was enough for the Foxes as they beat the Hammers 1-0 to clinched all three points at the King Power Stadium and end 2016 on a positive note. It was an entertaining game as both teams worked hard to try and end 2016 with a win. In the end Leicester came out on top and ended their dream year with a victory.
,action,FULL-TIME: LEICESTER 1-0 WEST HAM
90'+6',action,That's the final whistle!
90'+3',action,CHANCE! It was excellent defending by Leicester as they continue to keep West Ham at bay. Ogbonna meets Payet's corner at the near post but several Leicester players throw themselves at the shot and then eventually clear the danger.
90',action,There will be a minimum of six minutes of added time played here at the King Power Stadium.
89',action,"Leicester are working very hard in the final minutes here and they've won a corner after a good piece of skill by Okazaki. The corner is initially cleared by the Hammers but the Foxes keep the pressure up and the ball falls to Chilwell on the edge of the box, with the time and space, but he drills his shot straight at Randolph! Okazaki reaches the rebound but his header goes over the bar!"
86',action,CARROLL GOES CLOSE! Andy Carroll rises highest and fires a powerful header narrowly wide. Was that the chance the Hammers had been waiting for? The striker looks devastated to have not scored with that attempt.
85',action,"Ulloa almost makes an instant impact! He does very well to beat Cresswell down the left flank and tries to square the ball to Shinji Okazaki who was waiting in the box, but Reid stickes out a leg and deflects the ball."
84',yellow-card,Yellow Card Manuel Lanzini. Plenty of yellow cards have been given out here. Manuel Lanzini is the latest player to be cautioned by Anthony Taylor.
83',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Danny Simpson. Another yellow card, this time it is Danny Simpson for kicking the ball away after a foul had been given against him."
83',substitution,Substitution sub-out Islam Slimani sub-in José Leonardo Ulloa . The goalscorer sub-out Islam Slimani is replaced by sub-in José Leonardo Ulloa.
82',action,"Less than ten minutes to go here at the King Power Stadium. Can Leicester see the game out and gain all three points, or will West Ham make all of their pressure count and grab an equalising goal?"
80',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Demarai Gray sub-in Shinji Okazaki . Another Leicester substitution now, as sub-out Demarai Gray goes off to a standing ovation from the home supporters, he is replaced by sub-in Shinji Okazaki."
78',substitution,Substitution sub-out Cheikhou Kouyaté sub-in Edimilson Fernandes . Third and final substitution for the Hammers as sub-out Cheikhou Kouyaté comes off and is replaced by sub-in Edimilson Fernandes.
76',action,Antonio appeals for a penalty after throwing himself down in the penalty area after a slight touch from Huth. However the referee is having none of it! It looked like Antonio was trying to win a penalty there and rather spectacularly hauled himself to the ground.
75',action,"West Ham are pressing hard for an equaliser, keeping Leicester in their own half, however the Hammers final ball is letting them down. The Foxes need to win the ball back and play a few passes together to ease the pressure they are currently under."
72',yellow-card,Yellow Card Kasper Schmeichel. Kasper Schmeichel receives a yellow card for his protests to Nordtveit just being given a yellow card.
71',yellow-card,Yellow Card Håvard Nordtveit. Håvard Nordtveit goes into the book for a very high and dangerous tackle on Chilwell. The West Ham right-back looks lucky to still be on the pitch after catching the Leicester man in the chest with that challenge.
70',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Riyad Mahrez sub-in Christian Fuchs . sub-out Riyad Mahrez doesn't look too pleased to be substituted, he is replaced by sub-in Christian Fuchs."
66',yellow-card,Yellow Card Marc Albrighton. Second foul in the space of a minute by Marc Albrighton and he receives a yellow card.
66',action,"Another free-kick for West Ham after another foul by Albrighton. This time it is Cresswell to take with is left-foot. The left-back hits it low which beats the wall, but Chilwell deflects the shot which almost puts it out of the reach of Schmeichel but the goalkeeper is on his toes and does well to make the save."
65',substitution,Substitution sub-out André Ayew Pelé sub-in Sofiane Feghouli . Not the best of performances from André Ayew and he is replaced by sub-in Sofiane Feghouli.
65',action,West Ham are awarded a free-kick in a very dangerous position after the referee deemed Albrighton to have handled the ball. Payet whips the ball into the box but Huth does well to clear the danger.
63',action,Looks like we are about to see another West Ham substitution as they press for an equalising goal. Leicester doing well to deny them at the moment but the Hammers are dominating possession in the Foxes half.
60',action,"Now it's Leicester's chance to attack! Slimani races onto a through ball behind the West Ham defence, but Ogbonna does very well to get back and win the ball back off the Algerian."
58',action,CHANCE WEST HAM! Lanzini picks out Carroll in the box with an inch-perfect pass. The striker is just about to strike at goal when Huth produces a stunning challenge to deny him and put the ball out for a corner. The resulting corner is well claimed in the air by Schmeichel.
57',substitution,Substitution sub-out Mark Noble sub-in Manuel Lanzini . sub-out Mark Noble hobbles off after failing to recover from the challenge by Amartey and is replaced by sub-in Manuel Lanzini.
56',action,"Slaven Bilic will be happy with the start that his side has made so far, as the Hammers look far more dangerous going forward. Kouyate has just tried his luck from long-range, but the midfielder's strike goes well over the bar."
53',action,"West Ham are dominating possession at the moment, they've certainly improved their attacking passes into the front men. Andy Carroll has already been involved a lot more."
52',action,"Leicester have a good record when it comes to the final league games of a calendar year, as they haven't lost their final league match since 2010, winning three and drawing twice."
50',action,"Noble is back on the pitch now, however the Hammers skipper doesn't look very comfortable though, so we may be about to see the first substitution of the game."
47',action,"Brief stoppage in play here as Mark Noble is down in the middle of the pitch receiving treatment after a poor challenge from Amartey. The Leicester man's boot was very high and certainly catches Noble, the Hammers skipper looks in a lot of pain."
47',yellow-card,Yellow Card Daniel Amartey. The referee deems the challenge by Amartey to just be worthy of a yellow card.
46',action,We're back underway!
,action,The teams are back out and the second-half is almost upon us!
,action,Leicester started the game brilliantly and took the lead through Islam Silmani on 20 minutes. The hosts could have scored more but West Ham grew into the game as the minutes passed and began to fashion chances of their own. Antonio smashed a volley against the crossbar and Payet has looked dangerous as well as the Hammers ended the opening half strongly. Stay tuned for another action packed half!
,action,HALF-TIME: LEICESTER 1-0 WEST HAM
45'+2',action,That's the half-time whistle!
45'+1',action,Mahrez whips the resulting free-kick towards to top corner of the West Ham goal. It's looks to be heading into the top corner but Randolph does well to produce a spectacular save to deny the Leicester man.
45',yellow-card,Yellow Card Angelo Obinze Ogbonna. Ogbonna is the first West Ham player to receive a yellow card for a cynical foul on Gray in a dangerous position.
44',yellow-card,Yellow Card Robert Huth. Huth receives a yellow card for his reckless challenge on Payet.
43',action,"Just seconds later West Ham break and they should've equalised! Antonio leads a fast West Ham counter but his cross inside to Ayew is a poor once and easily intercepted. Robert Huth then clatters into Payet on the edge of the box and gives away another free-kick in an excellent position, which Payet takes and forces Schmeichel into a save."
42',action,"It's end-to-end here! First Leicester counter-attack and Nordtveit is forced into a great recovering challenge to prevent Slimani from making it two! The Algerian looked almost certain to double Leicester's lead by converting Albrighton's cross, until Nordtveit's challenge."
40',action,OFF THE BAR! Antonio comes so close to scoring the equaliser! It was terrific build-up play by West Ham and Antonio swivels in the box and volleys a powerful shot against the crossbar. That's the closest the Hammers have come to scoring so far today.
39',action,West Ham are doing their best to try and grab an equalising goal before the half-time whistle here. They're forcing Leicester back and starting to create a lot more chances.
37',action,Payet fires the free-kick straight at the Leicester wall! Good defending from the hosts. We've all seen Payet score from that distance before!
36',action,West Ham free-kick in a terrific position for Payet to try and work the goalkeeper. The set-piece is around 25 yards from goal and looks to be in a perfect position for Payet!
34',action,Another good opportunity for Leicester but Gray is caught offside! The pacy winger made his defence splitting run slightly too early and the high Hammers defence caught him offside. If he had held his run he would have been through on goal with just the keeper to beat.
32',action,What a stat this is!  Slimani has scored 15 of his 33 league goals since the start of 2015-16 from headers (45%). Wow!
30',action,"Better from the Hammers! Antonio races in behind the Leicester defence, feints to shoot at goal before cutting the ball back to Payet, who is far better positioned in the middle of the box. The Frenchman hesitates for slightly too long, which allows Albrighton to pinch the ball off him before he can get a shot away."
29',action,"West Ham are struggling to keep possession here, when they do have the ball Leicester are putting them under a lot of pressure and making sure that the likes of Payet and Andre Ayew don't have time and space on the ball in dangerous areas of the pitch."
27',action,"STATS: West Ham last failed to score against Leicester in a league match in August 2004, which was in the Championship. Plus the Hammers have beaten the reigning Premier League champions only once in an away match, beating Manchester United 1-0 back in 2001."
24',action,There is a fantastic atmosphere here at the King Power Stadium! The crowd are showing their appreciation for their player's excellent start here.
22',action,"Leicester are pressing hard for a second goal now, West Ham are struggling to cope with Mahrez, Gray and Silmani as they're completly being overrun and are lucky to only be one-nil down."
20',assist,"Assist Marc Albrighton. It was an inch-perfect cross by Marc Albrighton, straight onto the head of Silmani and the striker converted!"
20',goal,"Goal Islam Slimani. GGGOOOAAALLL LEICESTER! Silmani gives the Foxes the lead! After coming so close early on, this time Silmani has made no mistakes! It was a wonderful ball in from Albrighton and Silmani lost Winston Reid in the box and powered a header into the far corner of the goal! Nothing more than they deserve."
19',action,"The resulting corner comes to nothing as West Ham use their aerial power to clear, however it is still Leicester on the front foot and knocking on the Hammers door."
18',action,"Gray does well very once again down the left flank after receiving the ball from Chilwell, he whips a good ball into the box which is slightly too high for Mahrez. However Albrighton picks the ball up on the right and wins a corner for the Foxes."
15',action,"Foxes left-back Ben Chilwell is getting forward at every opportunity here, linking up well with Demarai Gray on the wing and trying to exploit the Hammers right flank."
14',action,"Leicester are showing plenty of promise going forward, but it has been a frantic opening period!"
11',action,"CHANCE WEST HAM! The Hammers have finally got a foothold in this game, Aaron Cresswell put a inch-perfect ball into the box and Michail Antonio met it at the far post, but he fires it well over the crossbar. That was poor defending by Leicester and Antonio should have done better with that opportunity."
9',action,Leicester are unbeaten in their past three in the Premier League against West Ham (W2 D1) - they've never gone four without defeat against the Hammers in the Premier League. Not a bad omen!
6',action,West Ham are having to withstand plenty of pressure here early on as Leicester look very dangerous going forward in the early stages of this game.
4',action,"OFF THE POST! Leicester go close once again! Islam Slimani does well to lose his man in the box and meets Marc Albrighton's cross from the right, but his header crashes against the post and West Ham can clear. Albrighton broke down the right and put a terrific ball into the box, but the angle was very tight for Silmani, but he is very unlucky not to have given Leicester the lead."
3',action,"CHANCE MAHREZ! Very good start from Leicester, Riyad Mahrez latches onto Daniel Amartey's lofted pass, chests the ball and volleys a dipping effort towards goal which forces Darren Randolph into making an early save! Good opportunity for the hosts."
2',action,"What a spectacular 2016 it has been for Leicester City, however after a poor run of form they will be looking forward to 2017 and a victory here today would be the perfect end to the year."
1',action,West Ham get the game underway!
