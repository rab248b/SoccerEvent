,action,Full-time: Middlesbrough 1-3 West Ham United
90'+4',goal,"Goal Jonathan Calleri. GOOOOAAALLLLLL!!!!! West Ham seal all three points as Calleri’s effort deflects off Clayton and into the corner! The opportunity appeared to have gone for West Ham as Fernandes chose not to shoot but instead square the ball across goal towards Lanzini, but the winger kept the ball in play before laying it off to Calleri who slotted home off Clayton from 15 yards out."
90'+4',assist,Assist Manuel Lanzini. Assist Manuel Lanzini
90'+2',action,"We’re into five minutes of added time as West Ham break away and look to kill off the game, but Lanzini dwells on the ball too long with space inside the left-hand edge of the area and his shot is blocked out for a corner."
90',action,"CLOSE!! Negredo gets up really well to knock down Gibson’s long ball into the feet of Gestede, and the substitute takes on an ambitious first time shot from the edge of the box which flies just wide of Randolph’s left-hand upright."
89',action,"Chambers loops the ball in towards Bamford just outside the six yard box and the forward goes to ground, but there was very little contact and Bamford gets straight up to his feet without calling for a penalty."
86',action,Middlesbrough are seeing the majority of the ball here but West Ham look extremely well organised with what is essentially now a 5-4-1 formation and the home side are struggling to find any real way through.
83',substitution,Substitution sub-out Sofiane Feghouli sub-in James Collins . Slaven Bilic responds by making a defensive switch with Feghouli being replaced by sub-in James Collins.
83',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Adam Forshaw sub-in Rudy Gestede . Aitor Karanka is bringing another striker on now in an attempt to get back into this game, with new signing sub-in Rudy Gestede replacing Forshaw."
83',yellow-card,Yellow Card Bernardo José Espinosa Zúñiga. Things just starting to get a little bit scrappy now as Bernardo becomes the latest player to go into Martin Atkinson’s book
82',action,"Chance for Calleri!! Lanzini flicks the ball into the path of the striker who is unmarked just inside the box, but rushes his shot and can only drag it wide of the near post."

80',yellow-card,Yellow Card Ben Gibson. Gibson goes into the book for a cynical foul on Antonio.
79',action,"Nearly a disaster at the back for West Ham as Byram and Randolph fail to communicate with each other and the right-back chests the ball past his keeper who had come to collect de Roon’s cross, but fortunately for West Ham there were no Middlesbrough players in a position to take advantage and the ball rolls out for a corner."
77',action,"Once again the home crowd are furious with referee Atkinson as Byram pulls back Traore as the winger chases a ball in behind the West Ham defence, but the official waives play on."
74',action,The home crowd scream for a penalty as Cresswell appears to block Stuani’s cross with his hand. The left-back looks rather anxious but the Middlesbrough players don't appear to be complaining with the decision.
71',action,"Middlesbrough win a free-kick in a dangerous area on the left-hand edge of the box after Reid was adjudged to have blocked Traore’s cross with his arm, but Clayton’s resultant cross is well headed away by Calleri, who’s been heavily involved since his introduction."
69',action,Calleri’s first action is to concede a foul for leading with his arm as he jumped for a high ball with Gibson. It looks as though the substitute has been asked to put pressure on the Middlesbrough defence here.
67',substitution,Substitution sub-out Andy Carroll sub-in Jonathan Calleri . A second change of the afternoon now for West Ham as Carroll goes off to be replaced by sub-in Jonathan Calleri.
64',action,"OFF THE BAR!!!! Traore shows a wonderful bit of skill to skip away from two defenders before feeding Negredo who plays a lovely ball across the face of goal towards Stuani. The winger is behind Cresswell at the back post and the West Ham left-back tries to play the ball out for a corner, but can only drill the ball straight into Stuani’s chest and watch the ball bounce up onto the bar, before Reid chests the ball safely back into Randolph’s arms."
61',action,Middlesbrough are starting to increase the tempo here and the crowd are responding by increasing their noise levels as their side look to get back into this game.
58',action,"Chambers does superbly well to steal possession away from Obiang deep inside the West Ham half before driving towards the edge of the area and shooting with his left foot, but the effort is a poor one from the right-back and slices horribly wide of the goal."
56',action,"Wonderful save from Randolph!! Traore once again causes problems as he gets to the by-line and pulls back a cross towards de Roon, who arrives late into the area and directs a powerful header towards the left-hand corner, but Randolph springs to his right keep it out."
54',substitution,Substitution sub-out Mark Noble sub-in Edimilson Fernandes . Noble isn't going to be able to continue after that knock and is replaced by sub-in Edimilson Fernandes in what is West Ham's first change.
53',action,"Chambers plays a lovely diagonal ball in towards Stuani at the back post, but Reid does exceptionally well to backpedal and get his head to the ball first to clear the danger."
50',action,"Noble is back on the pitch but not moving too freely as Clayton concedes a free-kick for a foul on Feghouli close to halfway, but Gibson gets up well to head Byram’s long ball in clear."
49',action,Noble was involved in a collision with Bernardo in the build up to that chance and he’s hobbling off to receive some treatment now.
48',action,"HUGE CHANCE FOR LANZINI!! Carroll slips a simple ball into the path of Lanzini who’s clean through on goal with only Valdes to beat, but the winger tries to open up his body and take the shot with his right foot and only succeeds in hitting a tame effort straight into the arms of Valdes."
46',action,"Chance for Antonio! A really bright start to the second half for West Ham here as Byram swings in a dangerous cross towards Antonio in the middle of the box, but the Englishman can’t get high enough and heads the ball comfortably over the bar from eight yards out."
46',action,Kick-off! West Ham get the second half underway.
,action,"Karanka will though be pleased with the threat posed by Adama Traore down the right-hand side, and could well turn to his new signings Rudy Gestede and Patrick Bamford on the bench in the second half, while Bilic will be asking for more of the same from his side going forwards."
,action,"West Ham lead at the Riverside Stadium after two goals from Andy Carroll either side of Cristhian Stuani’s equaliser. Slaven Bilic’s side have been the more creative of the two sides and deservedly go into the break ahead, although Aitor Karanka will certainly be disappointed with his side’s defending of the two goals."
,action,Half-time: Middlesbrough 1-2 West Ham United
45'+1',action,"We’re into two minutes of stoppage time now as West Ham once again appeal for a penalty following a challenge on Feghouli from Friend, but just as he did earlier in the half, Martin Atkinson waives the calls away."
43',goal,"Goal Andy Carroll. GOOOOAAAALLLLLL!!!! Carroll puts West Ham back ahead! Antonio picks the ball up 30 yards out from goal and fires a fierce low shot towards the bottom corner. Valdes does well to get down to his right and keep the ball out but he can only palm the ball straight into the path of Carroll, who taps the ball underneath the keeper for his second of the afternoon."
42',action,Middlesbrough have certainly grown into the game as the half as gone on here and look far more comfortable in possession than they did for the first 15 minutes.
39',action,"Traore is causing all sorts of problems now for West Ham, once again getting in behind Ogbonna down the right-hand edge of the penalty box, but he just delays his cross fractionally and Reid gets back and does enough to put Negredo off as he looks to get a toe to it at the near post."
37',action,"CLOSE!! Middlesbrough put together a wonderful move with all ten outfield players except the two centre-halves involved, before Traore shows an extraordinary burst of pace to get behind the West Ham defence and fire a superb low cross across the face of goal, but Negredo is too deep to get on the end of it and Byram clears at the back post."
35',action,Antonio once again looks to turn Bernardo but the defender brings him to ground conceding the foul. Antonio looks to be in some discomfort but he’s back on his feet and the physios haven’t been called for.
32',action,"What a tackle from Friend!! Antonio rolls Bernardo with ease and slips the ball into Carroll who is just about to shoot from 12 yards out, but the Middlesbrough captain slides in to make an outstanding tackle before Bernardo recovers to deny Antonio a chance at the follow-up."
30',action,"Noble looks to get West Ham back ahead straight away as he attempts an audacious chip towards the left-hand corner from the edge of the box, but Valdes watches the ball sail safely wide of his post."
27',assist,Assist Calum Chambers. Chambers has been as big a threat as anyone for Middlesbrough so far and he produced a wonderful ball across for Stuani to score there.
27',goal,"Goal Cristhian Ricardo Stuani Curbelo. GOOOOAAAALLLLLL!!! Stuani brings Middlesbrough level! Middlesbrough work the ball patiently forwards before Traore lays the ball into the path of the overlapping Chambers on the right-hand side, and the full-back rolls the ball across the face of goal towards Stuani, who is waiting unmarked at the back post to tap home."
25',action,"Byram is penalised for a push on Feghouli inside the Middlesbrough half giving the home side a chance to enjoy a good period of possession, something they’ve done much so far."
23',action,"Stuani picks out Negredo with an inswinging cross from the left but, the Spaniard has very little support in the middle and his chested touch forward is acrobatically cleared by Reid."
21',action,"Half-chance for Antonio. Sofiane Feghouli picks out Antonio with a lovely chipped through ball between the two Middlesbrough centre-backs, but the winger fails to bring the ball under control with Valdes stood in no-man’s land."
18',action,"The West Ham players appeal to referee Atkinson for a penalty as Noble goes down under a challenge from Bernardo inside the box, but the official isn’t interested although replays appear to show the defender making no contact with the ball."
16',action,"West Ham appear to be settling in to a 4-4-2 when they have the ball here, with Antonio looking to get up alongside Carroll as often as possible."
14',action,"The crowd are starting to find their voice now as Chambers once again finds space to cross towards Negredo, but the West Ham defence manage to scramble the ball clear for a corner, which is well headed away by Carroll."
12',action,"The first real venture forward for Middlesbrough now as Calum Chambers gets down the outside of Cresswell on the right and looks to cross towards Alvaro Negredo at the back post, but the ball is just too high for him."
9',assist,"Assist Manuel Lanzini. Victor Valdes may well feel he could have come to collect the corner there, but it was a superb ball in from Lanzini from the left nonetheless."
9',goal,Goal Andy Carroll. GOOOAAALLLLLLLL!!!! Carroll heads West Ham into the lead!! West Ham have started really well here and open the scoring as Carroll climbs above Bernardo to powerfully head home Lanzini’s corner from just six yards out.
6',yellow-card,Yellow Card Manuel Lanzini. Lanzini receives the first booking of the day for bringing down Adama Traore just inside the Middlesbrough half.
6',action,"West Ham have made really bright start here as Manuel Lanzini looks to get in behind the Middlesbrough defence down the left, but having picked out Cresswell, who’d made another good overlapping run, the left-back fails to get a cross in to the middle, much to the frustration of Andy Carroll."
3',action,"What a chance for West Ham!! Aaron Cresswell is picked out in space with a lovely cross-field pass from Winston Reid, and having played a neat one-two with Mark Noble the left-back fires a low cross into Michail Antonio at the near post, but the winger doesn’t get a decent connection from six yards out and the ball goes wide of the far post."
1',action,Kick-off! Referee Martin Atkinson blows his whistle and Middlesbrough get the game underway.
,action,"The two sides shared the points when they met at London Stadium earlier in the season, with Dimitri Payet’s outstanding individual goal cancelling out Cristhian Stuani’s opener in a 1-1 draw, however Payet will not feature for West Brom today as speculation over his future continues."
