,action,"Well, that was good fun! In the end, a draw is certainly a fair result, as both teams battled hard and would feel hard done by if they had to leave empty-handed. Liverpool were the better of the two in the first half before sitting slightly too deep after the break, allowing United to constantly hammer away at them before they finally broke their opponents down. The home side then pushed hard for a late winner, but by that point it was slightly too late."
,action,FULL-TIME: MANCHESTER UNITED 1-1 LIVERPOOL
90'+4',action,"It's all United as they push every available body forward in search of a late, late winning goal, but they're unable to break down a formidable Liverpool defence before Fellaini gives away a free-kick by dragging Klavan to the ground. That should be that."
90'+3',action,"What an opportunity for Wijnaldum! Can breaks towards the edge of the United penalty area before teeing up Wijnaldum with a great knock to his left, but the Dutchman's side-footed shot is far too weak and ends up rolling straight into the hands of De Gea in the middle of the goal."
90'+1',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Roberto Firmino Barbosa de Oliveira. Firmino reacts angrily and pushes Herrera to the floor in retaliation, and he too is booked."
90'+1',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ander Herrera Agüera. Another United attack fails to result in a chance on goal and Liverpool counter quickly, but Firmino is unable to get past the halfway line after being dragged back by Herrera, who receives a yellow card for his cynical challenge."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be four minutes of added time.
89',action,"It's all United at the moment as they desperately try to find a late winner, but Liverpool have plenty of bodies behind the ball and do well to bring another attempted attacking move to an end over on the left flank."
87',action,"The corner initially fails to result in a chance on goal for Liverpool before Lallana charges into the box on a lovely run. He beats one player before taking on Fellaini, but the midfielder comes out on top and does well to poke the ball back to De Gea."
86',action,"Can flies down the right flank before curling a cross into the middle of the United penalty area that is nodded on to Wijnaldum. The Dutchman takes a quick touch and then unleashes a shot, but it's closed down by Jones and deflects out for a corner."
84',assist,"Assist Luis Antonio Valencia Mosquera. Valencia did well to set up Ibrahimovic, but United deserve full credit for their fight-back this half. They've put Liverpool under an incredible amount of pressure and it was only a matter of time until they were going to crack."
84',goal,"Goal Zlatan Ibrahimović. GOAL! United have equalised! The home side throw everything they've got at Liverpool as ball after ball is flung into the box. Rooney does well to get away from Alexander-Arnold before chipping a cross over to the far post, where Valencia knocks the ball into the path of Ibrahimovic and sets up the Swedish striker to beat Mignolet with a header on the edge of the six-yard box."
82',action,"What a save by Mignolet! A looping cross from Herrera flies into the Liverpool box and finds Mata. The Spaniard rises high and nods the ball down to Rooney, who immediately unleashes a thumping strike that is pushed away by the feet of Mignolet at the near post."
80',action,"Coutinho picks up two free-kicks in quick succession after being clumsily tripped over inside the United half of the pitch. The second set-piece is curled into the penalty area in search of Lovren, but it fails to find the big Croatian and the home side do well to hold on."
78',action,"Herrera gets himself into a pocket of space just outside of the Liverpool penalty area and quickly tries to tee up Rooney with a chipped pass into the box, but it's totally mishit by the Spaniard and sails harmlessly out of play for a goal-kick. The United captain doesn't look at all happy with that!"
76',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Matteo Darmian sub-in Marouane Fellaini-Bakkioui . Mourinho has made his final roll of the dice, with Darmian making way for Marouane Fellaini. It looks as if Mkhitaryan is going to take the Italian's place at left-back."
75',action,"Great chance for Wijnaldum! Pogba is caught in possession inside the Liverpool half of the pitch and gifts the visitors with an opportunity to fly forward. Can flies down the right flank on a great run before setting up Wijnaldum, but the Dutchman's diving header ends up looping a few yards over the top of the crossbar."
74',action,"Liverpool continue to enjoy a good spell of possession inside the hosts' half of the pitch before Firmino is set up over on the left flank, but the Brazilian's dart down the wing is slightly mistimed and he's flagged offside just as he's about to cut towards the penalty area."
72',action,"Milner is able to get back to his feet after a couple of minutes and the game gets underway once again. Liverpool immediately push forward and wins themselves a throw-in, which is quickly sent over to Wijnaldum, but the Dutchman is unable to reach the ball inside the penalty area and loses out to Jones."
70',action,"Ouch! Rooney and Milner battle for the ball as they both try to latch on to a loose pass, but the challenge from the United captain is a high one and catches the latter on the ankle, leaving him in serious discomfort on the floor."
68',action,"United patiently pass the ball around inside the Liverpool half of the pitch as they desperately try to find a way through the sea of defenders camped in front of them, but they're unable to do so before a looping cross from Mata is easily collected by Mignolet."
66',action,"Lallana goes close! Coutinho wriggles his way through a sea of red shirts as he somehow makes it into the United penalty area. The Brazilian then spins and finds Lallana, but the midfielder's low shot fails to beat De Gea at the near post."
65',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Anthony Martial sub-in Juan Manuel Mata García . United have made their second alteration, with Martial making way for Juan Mata."
64',action,"Rooney peels away from his marker on the edge of the Liverpool penalty area before trying to test Mignolet with a 20-yard strike, but he's unable to make decent contact with the ball and ends up sending it bouncing well wide of the far post."
63',action,"Darmian cuts inside from the left wing and fires a dangerous cross into the middle of the Liverpool penalty area that Klavan does well to head away from Rooney. Ibrahimovic decides to keep the ball in play before fizzing it across the face of goal, but there's nobody there to get a touch on the pass."
62',action,"Chance for Firmino! Coutinho makes an immediate impact as Liverpool go on the offensive for one of the first times since the break, but Firmino's low shot towards the near post is well pushed away by De Gea."
61',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Georginio Wijnaldum. Wijnaldum is shown a yellow card, presumably for dissent after having a few words with the referee."
61',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Divock Okoth Origi sub-in Philippe Coutinho Correia . Liverpool have made their first change of the game, with Philippe Coutinho coming on to replace Origi."
60',action,"United keep pushing forward as they continue to put their visitors under plenty of pressure, but a promising attacking move comes to a disappointing end after Pogba fires an audacious long-range strike well wide of its intended target."
59',action,"Mkhitaryan spins round his marker on the right wing before flying towards the Liverpool penalty area. The Armenian then plays a quick one-two with Rooney before looking to shoot, but he's out-muscled by Lallana just as he's about to do so."
57',action,"Herrera picks up the ball in a good position over on the right flank and quickly fires a long pass down the wing and into the path of Rooney, but the captain is unable to pick out a team-mate after spinning on the edge of the penalty area and sends the ball straight to Mignolet at the near post."
55',action,"This time it's Mkhitaryan who curls the set-piece into the Liverpool box and towards a team-mate, but Mignolet rushes out to punch the ball away from danger and over to the left wing."
54',action,"What a chance for Mkhitaryan! Alexander-Arnold loses out over on the right wing and gifts United with a great chance to fly forward on a counter-attack. They do so brilliantly through Martial before Ibrahimovic spins and finds Mkhitaryan, but the Armenian's low cross-cum-shot fails to find the back of the net and is deflected out for another corner."
52',action,"The ball pinballs around the edge of the Liverpool penalty area before Rooney tries to poke a pass into the path of Ibrahimovic, but the Swedish striker is unable to muscle his way through a sea of defenders and loses out to Mignolet."

48',action,"Origi goes close! United lose the ball in the Liverpool half of the pitch and allow the visitors to break forward on a quick counter-attack. Firmino flies through the middle of the field before teeing up Origi to his left, but the Belgian's curling strike is deflected just wide of the far post and out for a corner."
46',action,"United have made one substitution during the half-time break, with Carrick making way for Wayne Rooney in an attack-minded alteration."
46',action,And we're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half.
,action,"So far, so good for Liverpool, who have done well to nullify a United side that haven't quite got going yet. The visitors haven't been presented with too many chances to test De Gea, but Milner was easily able to beat the Spaniard with a thumping strike from the spot that left him with no chance. At the other end, Liverpool have looked surprisingly solid, making life difficult for Ibrahimovic in front of goal."
,action,HALF-TIME: MANCHESTER UNITED 0-1 LIVERPOOL
45'+1',action,"Alexander-Arnold flies into Martial but completely misses the Frenchman, gifting him with an opportunity to set up Pogba. It's one he's unable to take, however, as his attempted through-ball into the penalty area is poor and easily cut out by Lovren."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be just one minute of added time.
44',action,"Milner sends another dangerous cross into the United box and towards a team-mate, but, luckily for the Frenchman, Pogba ends up winning his side a free-kick after being pushed over by Klavan as the two battled for the ball."
43',action,"Origi breaks down the left flank before cutting inside and being barged to the ground by Valencia, resulting in a free-kick for Liverpool in a dangerous position.

41',action,"Golden opportunity for Mkhitaryan! The Armenian flies through the Liverpool back line and into the visitors' penalty area before latching on to a wonderful pass forward from Herrera, but he's unable to beat Mignolet and instead fires his shot straight at the Belgian."
40',action,"Almost a chance for Origi! Rojo is caught out at the back and is unable to deal with Origi, who does wonderfully well to muscle his way past the defender. He then tries to break into the penalty area to take on De Gea, but Matteo Darmian darts across the box to deal with the striker at the vital moment."
38',action,"Milner barges into Mkhitaryan from behind and gives away a free-kick midway inside the Liverpool half of the pitch. It's taken quickly and worked over to Pogba, but the Frenchman loses out to Wijnaldum before conceding a free-kick himself."
37',action,"Martial sets up Valencia, who had flown down the right wing on a dangerous run, but Liverpool have enough bodies back to deal with the danger and concede a corner. Mkhitaryan's cross is fired towards Ibrahimovic, but Lovren rises high above the Swedish striker to beat him in the air."

32',action,"The resulting free-kick is flung into the middle of the Liverpool box but is easily nodded out of play for a corner by Can. It's whipped into the penalty area and cleared only as far as Herrera, who is then bundled over by a clumsy challenge from Origi just a yard or so outside of the box. Can Ibrahimovic fire his side back into the game?"
31',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Dejan Lovren. Alexander-Arnold carelessly concedes possession over on the right flank and allows Liverpool to fly forward on a quick counter-attack, but Lovren is there to stop Ibrahimovic in his tracks. The Croatian then tries to close down Martial to stop him from reaching the loose ball, but he's slightly late with his sliding challenge and is shown a yellow card as a result."
29',action,"Pogba tries to make amends for his mistake by thumping a chipped cross into the Liverpool box and towards Ibrahimovic, but it's slightly underhit by the Frenchman and fails to find the striker in front of goal, allowing the visitors to easily deal with the danger."

He then brings down a lofted Can pass with a wonderful first touch, but he's unable to beat Martial with his thumping strike that deflects away from danger."
23',action,"Milner takes his time with the set-piece before whipping a cross into the penalty area, where it finds Lovren. The defender does well to rise high above Pogba before nodding the ball down to Origi, but the striker is unable to make decent contact with the ball and sends it spinning into the hands of De Gea."
22',action,"A misplaced pass from Michael Carrick flies out of play and results in a throw-in for Liverpool. It's taken quickly and sent over to Origi, who bursts down the right flank before winning his side a free-kick after being bundled over by Pogba."
20',action,"What a chance for Pogba! The Frenchman darts through the middle of the Liverpool defence and links up brilliantly with Henrikh Mkhitaryan, but the Frenchman scuffs his shot from the edge of the box and ends up sending it bobbling just wide of the far post. He really should have buried that!"
19',action,"Almost a costly mistake by Lovren!

18',action,"Pogba is caught out in the middle of the pitch, allowing Liverpool to break forward quickly. Can darts towards the penalty area before teeing up Adam Lallana, but the midfielder is unable to beat Marcos Rojo before Trent Alexander-Arnold fires a looping cross several yards over the top of the crossbar."

13',action,"Martial goes down inside the penalty area, but nothing is given! The Frenchman showcases some great footwork on the edge of the Liverpool box before ploughing into the penalty area and going down after tangling with Lovren.

12',action,"United give away another free-kick, this time for a challenge on Firmino by Ander Herrera.

10',action,"Georginio Wijnaldum is tripped from behind and wins a free-kick for Liverpool just inside the United half of the pitch, but Roberto Firmino's run forward in an attempt to reach Milner's lofted pass is mistimed and he's quickly flagged offside as a result."
8',action,"Anthony Martial twists and turns as he weaves his way down the left wing, but he loses out to Lovren and concedes a throw-in. It's taken quickly and sent to Lovren, who then fires a strange cross-field pass straight out of play for a United throw-in over on the opposite flank."
6',action,"United patiently pass the ball around inside the Liverpool half of the pitch before Valencia swings a cross into the penalty area and over to Zlatan Ibrahimovic at the far post, but the Swedish striker loses out in the air and is unable to get the better of Dejan Lovren in the air."

,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"A usually free-flowing, attack-minded Liverpool side failed to find the back of the net in each of their previous two games, which was the first time they were unable to do so since last February. The absence of Sadio Mane, who is currently away at the Africa Cup of Nations, seemed to blunt their attack in Wednesday’s League Cup defeat against Southampton, and he could end up being missed again this afternoon as they try to break down the league’s third-best defence."
,action,"As for Liverpool, they were left frustrated by Sunderland in their last league outing, as the struggling side came from behind twice to hold Klopp’s men to a 2-2 draw at the Stadium of Light. The draw has resulted in them surrendering their second-place spot, but they will move back above both Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur if they’re victorious here today."
,action,"In the build-up to the game, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp insisted that United are a better team than when the two sides last met in an eventless stalemate at Anfield, and that certainly seems to be the case. All of their previous six Premier League games have ended in victories, with the Red Devils scoring nine times in their last four clashes. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has scored four of those, and the Swedish striker is back in the squad after missing the game against Hull during the week."
,action,"United’s early season struggles seem a thing of the past thanks to an excellent run of form that has seen them embark on a nine-game winning run across all competitions. Reading and Hull City were both easily dispatched in the FA Cup and League Cup, respectively, whilst the 2-0 win against West Ham United helped to move them to within five points of today’s opponents."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Premier League game between Manchester United and Liverpool at Old Trafford.
