,action,"What was a tough game in the first half became a relatively easy one for United after the break, as they continually caused problems for a Sunderland side that offered little going forward in response. Borini fired in a late consolation goal with an excellent volleyed effort late on, but it was one of the visitors' only attempts on goal throughout what was another difficult clash for the Black Cats, leaving them firmly inside the relegation zone for another week."
,action,FULL-TIME: MANCHESTER UNITED 3-1 SUNDERLAND
90'+3',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Lamine Koné. Ibrahimovic and Mkhitaryan link up well again before the latter is pulled to the ground by Kone, resulting in a free-kick for United right on the edge of the Sunderland box. Ibrahimovic steps up and unleashes a low strike with what will surely be the final chance of the game, but his thumping effort on goal is well saved by Pickford."
90'+1',goal,"Goal Fabio Borini. GOAL! Borini joins in on the fun! A curling cross from Denayer is only cleared as far as Borini, who chests the ball down before beating De Gea with an outrageous volleyed strike from 30 yards out. That was beautifully hit!"
88',action,"Pogba almost makes it 4-0! United keep pushing forward and win themselves a corner over on the right wing. It's fired into the penalty area and finds Pogba, but the Frenchman is unable to keep his headed effort down and fails to hit the target from close range."
86',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Didier Ndong Ibrahim sub-in Donald Love . Sunderland have made another late change, with Ndong making way for sub-in Donald Love."
86',assist,"Assist Zlatan Ibrahimović. Ibrahimovic did wonderfully well to pick out Mkhitaryan with a lovely cross into the heart of the Sunderland box, but it looked as if the Armenian may have been a yard or two offside."
86',goal,"Goal Henrikh Mkhitaryan. GOAL! What a strike by Mkhitaryan! Ibrahimovic drifts out to the right wing before curling a great cross into the middle of the box, where it finds Mkhitaryan. The ball is slightly behind the Armenian but he's somehow able to flick the ball over Pickford and into the back of the net with an outrageous back-heeled flick. That was sublime!"
84',substitution,Substitution sub-out Ander Herrera Agüera sub-in Marouane Fellaini-Bakkioui . Marouane Fellaini receives a mixed reception from the United fans as he comes on to replace Herrera.

82',assist,Assist Paul Pogba. Pogba did well to pounce on Ndong's mistake before picking out Ibrahimovic perfectly. The Frenchman has been excellent this afternoon and has caused Sunderland all sorts of problems for start to finish.
82',goal,"Goal Zlatan Ibrahimović. GOAL! It's 2-0 to United! Ndong gives away the ball cheaply in the middle of the pitch and allows United to break forward through Pogba. The Frenchman darts towards the penalty area before teeing up Ibrahimovic, who then finally gets the better of Pickford with a great side-footed strike."
81',action,"Defoe is dragged to the ground by Blind and wins Sunderland a free-kick in a good position midway inside the United half of the pitch. Larsson steps up and once again swings a good cross into the heart of the box, but the home side have enough bodies back to deal with the danger."
79',action,"Valencia finds himself in some space over on the right flank and darts down the wing before firing a cross towards the near post. It's sent slightly behind the Swedish striker but he's somehow able to send a poked back-heeled shot towards goal, but it lacks the power needed to trouble Pickford."
77',action,"Larsson is fouled over on the left wing by Valencia and wins Sunderland a free-kick in a dangerous position. It's fired into the penalty area and towards Anichebe at the back post, but Pogba is there to thump the ball away from the Nigerian."
75',action,"Martial almost makes an immediate impact after latching on to a lovely poked pass forward from Pogba, but the substitute's first touch is poor and he's eventually flagged offside before he can get a shot away."
74',substitution,Substitution sub-out Juan Manuel Mata García sub-in Anthony Martial . Mata has made way for sub-in Anthony Martial in United's second alteration of the afternoon.
72',action,Anichebe continues to cause problems for the United back line before doing well to win his side a corner. The set-piece is whipped into the box by Larsson but fails to find a white shirt and instead rolls harmlessly over to Valencia.
71',action,"Jones gets himself into a good position deep down the right wing before firing a dangerous cross into the penalty area. Anichebe rises high above his marker before nodding the ball down towards Defoe, but the ball fizzes just past the striker before the linesman's flag is eventually raised for offside."
69',action,"Defoe has seen little of the ball this afternoon, but he's finally given a chance to fly forward. He does well to muscle his way past Jones and into the United penalty area, but just as he's about to shoot, he has the ball poked away from him and into the hands of De Gea."
68',action,"Mkhitaryan, who has looked bright since coming on to the pitch, picks up the ball over on the left-hand side of the Sunderland box before swinging a cross towards Pogba at the far post, but Djilobodji rises high to beat the Frenchman to the ball with a well-timed header."
66',action,"Another great save by Pickford! Once again, Ibrahimovic charges into the right-hand side of the Sunderland penalty area before trying to beat Pickford, but the goalkeeper sticks out a foot to parry the ball away from danger. The Swedish striker just can't seem to score, no matter what he tries to do!"
64',action,"Chance for Mata! Pogba breaks into the right-hand side of the Sunderland box before chipping a cross-cum-shot towards the near post, and it's just about pushed away by Pickford. He can only clear the ball as far as Mata, however, but the Spaniard's close-range shot is quickly closed down by Jason Denayer."
63',action,"Mkhitaryan goes close! The Armenian makes an immediate impact after coming off the substitutes' bench as he tests Pickford from 25 yards out, but his curling shot ends up flying just past the fingertips of the goalkeeper and wide of the far post."

61',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Fabio Borini. Tackles have been flying in all over the place as things start to heat up slightly, and Borini becomes the latest player to receive a yellow card for a mistimed challenge of his own."
59',action,"Great tackle by Djilobodji! Lingard flies through the middle of the pitch on a wonderful run before teeing up Ibrahimovic, but just as the striker is about to penetrate the penalty area, he's dispossessed by a fantastic sliding tackle by Djilobodji that was timed to perfection."
58',action,"Ouch! Kone darts over to the right wing in an attempt to deal with a loose ball, but he ends up crashing into an unsuspecting ballboy after sliding off the pitch. The youngster seems to be okay, however, and receives a pat on the head from the Sunderland defender."

50',action,"Herrera is left all alone in far too much space over on the right wing, allowing him to lift a cross into the middle of the Sunderland box. Pogba does well to rise high above his marker before sending a headed effort towards goal, but it's slightly too powerful and fails to hit the target."
49',action,"Lingard spins well on the edge of the Sunderland penalty area before teeing up Herrera, but the Spaniard's first touch is slightly heavy and allows Djilobodji to poke the ball out for a corner over on the left flank that the visitors do well to deal with."
48',action,"Almost another chance for United! Ibrahimovic out-muscles Djilobodji far too easily over on the right flank before bursting towards the penalty area.

,action,"It's been a tough first half in which they've had to work hard, but United deservedly head into the break with a goal under their belts thanks to a great strike from Blind. Sunderland have performed well at the other end of the pitch, with Anichebe looking particularly dangerous with the ball at his feet, but the Nigerian switched off in the build-up to the home side's opener and was arguably at fault. Since then, United have been on the front foot, with Pogba and Mata both going close to increasing their lead."

45'+3',action,"And now Mata goes close!

45'+2',action,"Almost a great goal by Pogba! Ibrahimovic, who is now starting to get into the game far more than he was earlier in the afternoon, tees up Pogba with a poked pass from the edge of the box. The Frenchman chips up the ball, spins and fires a lovely volleyed strike towards goal, but Pickford does well to dive to his right to stop the effort from finding the back of the net."
45'+1',action,"A lofted pass forward finds Ibrahimovic, who does well to nod it down into the path of Valencia. The full-back then quickly sends the ball back to the Swedish striker before a cross is fired towards Lingard, but Kone is just about able to get a head on the ball."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be three minutes of added time.
43',action,"Blind darts down the left flank once again before swinging a low cross into the middle of the Sunderland penalty area, but it's sent slightly too near to Pickford and is easily cut out by the goalkeeper at the near post."

39',goal,"Goal Daley Blind. GOAL! United have taken the lead! Anichebe momentarily falls asleep and allows Blind to fly into the Sunderland penalty area and link up with Ibrahimovic, who held up the ball well before teeing up the Dutchman. The full-back then left Pickford with no chance with a thumping low strike that easily finds the bottom right-hand corner of the net."
38',action,"What a chance for Pogba! A floating cross from Blind is only half dealt with by Djilobodji, who sends his headed clearance straight to Pogba. The Frenchman quickly controls the ball with his chest before unleashing a volleyed strike, but his effort ends up looping a yard or so over the top of the crossbar."
36',action,"After dealing with the danger, United push forward on a quick counter-attack down the left wing. Pogba initially does well to get forward before being unable to tee up Ibrahimovic, and he's forced into unleashing an audacious strike from 30 yards out that is well saved by Pickford."

34',action,"Sunderland, who are enjoying a good spell of possession at the moment, come back again as they keep putting United under pressure. Borini finds himself in a pocket of space in the middle of the pitch and breaks forward quickly before shooting from the edge of the box, but his effort is well saved by De Gea in the centre of the goalmouth."
33',action,"Van Aanholt and Borini link up well deep down the left wing before the latter tries to swing a cross on to the head of Anichebe inside the penalty area, but he puts slightly too much power behind his attempted pass and ends up sending it flying out of play for a goal-kick."

29',action,"Sunderland go close to opening the scoring! A lovely chipped pass from Defoe isn't dealt with by Blind and falls to Anichebe, but the Nigerian completely scuffs his close-range shot before Borini's follow-up is parried away by the feet of De Gea."

21',action,"Mata goes down inside the penalty area, but nothing is given! United try to hit Sunderland on a counter-attack of their own with a thumping pass up towards Mata, but as soon as the Spaniard is about to reach the ball inside the box, he's barged to the ground by Kone. The home players and fans aren't at all happy with the defender's dealing with the midfielder, but the referee isn't at all interested and waves play on."
20',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Daley Blind. Fantastic stop by De Gea! Blind clumsily drags Anichebe to the ground just outside of the United box, resulting in a yellow card for the defender and a free-kick for Sunderland in a dangerous position.

13',action,"Jones sends a clever pass down the right flank and into the path of Fabio Borini, who takes on Daley Blind before settling for Sunderland's first corner of the afternoon.

,action,"Tottenham, Crystal Palace and, most recently, West Bromwich Albion have all tasted defeat against United in recent weeks, resulting in Jose Mourinho’s side picking up three consecutive league victories for only the second time under the Portuguese.

,action,"After suffering a frustrating draw away to Everton at the start of the month, United have won all of their previous three Premier League games and now have the opportunity to move equal on points with Tottenham Hotspur if they are victorious again here today. The omens certainly look good for the Red Devils, who have lost only one of their last 24 home games against Sunderland."
