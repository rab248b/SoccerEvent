,action,"The referee blows his whistle for the final time and Juventus leave with three well-earned and much-needed points. They looked far better than they did last weekend against Genoa, and they showed why they remain the favourites to win the title by making an in-form Atalanta side look extremely average. Gasperini's team just couldn't find any joy against the hosts, who kept them pegged back and constantly dominated on the break."
,action,FULL-TIME: JUVENTUS 3-1 ATALANTA

88',action,"Lemina hits the post! Cuadrado latches on to a lovely cross from Sandro before unleashing a thumping shot that is deflected towards goal. Sportiello is unable to deal with the bouncing effort and pushes it towards Lemina, but, under pressure from three Atalanta defenders, the midfielder is unable to find the back of the net and instead fires his scuffed effort into the ground and off the woodwork."
86',action,"Sandro cuts inside from the left flank and darts forward, but D'Alessandro is there to cynically bring him down from behind and give away a free-kick. Despite it being in a shooting position, Juventus unsurprisingly take their time with the set-piece before sending it short."
84',action,"Atalanta are enjoying the vast majority of possession at the moment as they try to make it a nervy final few minutes for Juventus with another goal, but the home side are now sitting deep inside their own half of the pitch as they attempt to keep the visitors at bay."

72',action,Lichtsteiner gets forward well over on the right wing and spots a good run into box from Pjanic. The Swiss full-back quickly tries to pick out the Bosnian but is unable to do so as his cross is overhit and sails harmlessly out for a goal-kick.

64',assist,"Assist Miralem Pjanić ; That was a lovely cross from Pjanic, but, once again, questions have to be asked of the Atalanta defence. They haven't done well enough when defending set-pieces and made life far too easily for Mandzukic this time."
63',action,"Great strike by Marchisio! A dangerous cross from Lichtsteiner fails to find a Juventus player but bounces out to Marchisio. The midfielder is in a good position just outside of the penalty area and quickly unleashes a rocket of a shot, but Sportiello is just about able to tip it round the near post with a one-handed diving save."

59',action,"Toloi tries to break into the Juventus penalty area but loses out to a sliding tackle from Mandzukic. However, the referee awards Atalanta a free-kick for handball, despite the replay showing that the ball hit the Croatian in the neck and not the arm. The striker isn't at all happy with the decision but the referee isn't interested in his protests."

Pjanic steps up and shoots from the set-piece, but there's far too much power behind his shot and it fails to trouble Sportiello."
49',action,"And now Petagna goes close! Atalanta hit Juventus on a determined counter-attack and finally get behind the hosts' back line, but Petagna is put off by Chiellini and is unable to test Buffon with his attempted close-range strike."

Their opponents started to come back into the game towards the end of the half, but Juventus have looked far more defensively solid than they did last week and did well to keep the visitors at bay."

That run could come to an end today, however, as both teams arguably start the day on near-equal footing. Juventus will be hoping that their impressive home form can help see them through, as they have won all of their last 23 Serie A home games, just two shy of the all-time record."
,action,"In stark contrast to their opponents, things couldn’t be going any better for Atalanta, who have arguably been the most impressive team so far this season and head to Turin unbeaten in their last 10 games. Nine of those have ended in victories, with their last failure to win coming against Fiorentina on October 16th. Their excellent run of form has seen them climb up to fifth place, just five points behind Juventus."
,action,"Juventus haven’t been helped by a swathe of injuries, leaving Massimiliano Allegri with several big choices to make at the back. The Bianconeri didn’t look at all comfortably defensively in the defeat against Genoa, with Mehdi Benatia, Leonardo Bonucci and Dani Alves all struggling before the latter two made way after picking up nasty injuries."
,action,"Whilst they aren’t quite embroiled in a crisis just yet, it certainly hasn’t been an ideal first third of the season for Juventus. The reigning Serie A champions lead the way at the top of the table but now sit just four points clear of both Roma and Milan after last weekend’s shocking 3-1 loss away to Genoa, their third defeat of the campaign."
,action,Good evening and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Serie A game between Juventus and Atalanta at the Juventus Stadium.
