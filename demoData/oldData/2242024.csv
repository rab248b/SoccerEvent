,action,"And that will do it! Llorente gets his second goal with one of the last kicks, or headers, of the game to give Swansea a deserved three points. Poor Burnley could not hold on until the end, but given the way that they were dominated throughout, and the poorly awarded penalty that led to their first goal, they can have few complaints. That's all from us, thanks for tuning in!"
90'+5',substitution,"; Carroll made that goal for Llorente, just as he did against Liverpool at Anfield. He's off now, with Jordi Amat coming on."
90'+4',action,"Ayew looks to settle it with one of the last kicks of the game, but it's saved by Robinson! Is there time for Burnley to get a late one here?"
90'+2',assist,Assist Tom Carroll ; Tremendous assist!
90'+2',goal,"Goal Fernando Llorente Torres ; SENSATIONAL FINISH! SWANSEA HAVE DONE IT! Carroll, for the umpteenth time, sends in a five-star cross that sees Llorente climbing all over Mee to thump a header into the back of the net for the win!"
90',action,"OFF THE LINE! Burnley don't deal with a corner, and it falls to Ayew on the edge of the area. Robinson saves with his legs, but he can only watch as Carroll's follow up is bundled around the post by Mee!"
89',substitution,"; Angel Rangel gets a late run out for Naughton, who needed to leave the game due to a knock to his hamstring."
87',action,"The home fans are on the edge of their seats, but Swansea are starting to labour a bit in their attempts to get the ball forward for a last flurry. This will feel like two points lost if it stays this way - particularly considering the penalty decision."
85',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Jack Cork ; Cork goes in late on Boyd, and is shown a yellow card."
85',action,"Four goals split between these two sides. Five minutes remaining. Is there time for a winner? This will be a great point for Burnley, who have not picked up many on their travels this season."
82',action,"OVER THE TOP OF THE BAR! From the resulting corner, it's cleared by Keane to the edge of the box, where Olsson swings his boot at it, sending a volley almost onto the roof of the net."
81',action,"Swansea come forward as Carroll plays a wonderful reverse ball into the path of Ayew, who beats one man and then two, but only wins a corner when he tries to evade the third."
80',substitution,; Ashley Westwood replaces Barton.
80',substitution,; James Tarkowski is on for Vokes.
79',action,"Sigurdsson pings in a dangerous cross almost onto the penalty spot that forces Mee into an unorthodox clearance on the swing. It arcs up to the far post, where Robinson has to punch clear."
77',action,"Another dreamy ball from the excellent Carroll finds Llorente at the far post, but the big striker mistimed his jump by a split second, which didn't get him on eye level with the ball, leading to a header that looped over."
75',action,"Good defending from Mee prevents a cross from Ayew from coming into the area, and from the resulting corner, Cork and Fernandez both have snap-shots blocked by the defence."
73',substitution,"; Jordan Ayew comes off the bench for the third time since arriving from Aston Villa, and he replaces another January signing in Narsingh."
71',action,"A huge cheer of relief went up from the stands after that goal, and now this game is truly up for grabs. You would fancy Swansea to score next, but we've been thinking that for over 70 minutes now and Burnley still have managed to surprise us twice."
69',assist,"Assist Gylfi Þór Sigurðsson ; He hasn't had his shooting boots on today, but he's still been decisive in the final third."
69',goal,"Goal Martin Olsson ; SWANSEA ARE LEVEL! Sigurdsson releases Olsson with a splendid heel flick, and the full-back keeps Boyd at arm's length before lashing the ball high into the back of the net! Wonderful!"
68',action,"I've got to hand it to Ward. The left-back looked to be fighting a losing battle on a yellow card against Narsingh, but he's kept his head to nullify the threat of the Swansea wide man in the second period."
66',substitution,; First substitution of the game for either side as Scott Arfield enters the fray for Brady.
66',action,"Mee covers a lot of ground striding forward with the ball out of defence, but then ruins his advance with a baffling pass right out of play."
64',action,"Olsson does well on the ball, driving down the left but then surprising the defence by cutting inside, before laying it off to Fer to strike from the edge of the D. The fans groan as that one flies wide."
61',assist,Assist Sam Vokes ; Superb target-man play!
61',goal,"Goal Andre Gray ; BURNLEY ARE AHEAD! Out of nowhere, the Clarets storm in front thanks to the boot of Gray. Vokes brought down a high ball well and flicked it into the path of his strike partner, who took it beautifully in stride to unleash a low finish."
60',action,"OFF TARGET AGAIN! Another excellent cross from the home side as Carroll delivers the ball on a plate for Sigurdsson, who surprisingly fails to execute on the volley, slicing it wide of the mark."
57',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Leroy Fer ; Barton and Fer go in for a 50-50 ball on the edge of the box, and the former scrambles it away just before he's clattered into by the latter. The challenge looked a lot worse than it actually was, which convinced the referee that it was worthy of a yellow card."
56',action,"It would be a surprise to see this match end in a draw, with Swansea splitting points in only three Premier League games this season, a division-low total. Burnley have registered just one more draw than that."
54',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ben Mee ; Mee has been a busy man in the second half, and he quite literally throws himself into the thick of things, flattening Fer with a sliding challenge. The referee didn't like that and books him."
52',action,"WIDE OF THE MARK! What do Swansea have to do to score again? Olsson puts in another peach of a cross that is glanced towards the far corner by Llorente ahead of Mee. However, it bounces the wrong side of the post."
50',action,"SWANSEA NEARLY TAKE THE LEAD! Sigurdsson tested Robinson with the last play of the first half and now, he's beaten the keeper, only for Mee to track back and scramble the ball off the line!"
48',action,"Gray gets the ball in a good position to feed Vokes, who tries an ambitious effort that nearly takes out a ball boy. Still, that will encourage the visiting side, who need more of that in the second half."
46',action,Off we go again.
,action,"Anthony Taylor and his officiating team are booed down the tunnel by the irate home fans, who have witnessed their team pegged back by Burnley despite playing the visitors off the park. Llorente gave Swansea the most deserved of leads, before an awful decision saw Gray level from the spot - with his teammate Vokes originally handling the ball to get the penalty. The woodwork was hit three times as the Welsh side just could not find that go-ahead goal. They've got 45 more minutes to do just that."
45'+3',action,"Sigurdsson stands over the last chance of the first half from a free-kick, and he goes for goal from a considerable distance. Robinson pushes it away and to Swansea's fury, Anthony Taylor doesn't allow the corner to be taken. Half time."
45'+1',action,"OFF THE WOODWORK AGAIN! Olsson gets down the line using that considerable pace of his, and he hangs a cross for Llorente to loop a header towards goal. Robinson is struggling as it bounces off the crossbar although to be fair, Burnley had a man covering on the line as well."
45',action,"Burnley will be relieved to hear the half-time whistle, which is now only moments away. They've been bombarded by the hosts, but look like they will head into the tunnel all square."
43',action,"Sigurdsson is left open on the edge of the area after a sweeping counter by Swansea led by Fer. He takes aim but can't find the target nor a teammate with the ball, which whistles wide of the post."
41',action,"Perhaps that inspiration will arrive from Gray. He buried a penalty and also had Burnley's best chance of the game. On his latest foray, he arrives at the near post to attack a cross, but can't keep it down."
39',action,"Burnley have struggled mightily to keep a hold of possession. Whenever they get a clearing head to a cross, Swansea are quickest onto the loose ball. The visitors need inspiration from somewhere."
36',action,"Swansea would be wise to keep giving Narsingh the ball. He has Ward on the ropes and with the full-back on a yellow card, he can be sure that there'll be more space than usual to operate."
34',action,"Strange strategy from Burnley here, who are standing off the wide players, allowing them enough space to keep sending crosses in. It's almost like they forgot that Swansea have a 6'5"", 90kg target to aim for."
32',action,"Ward has got to be careful. He's already on a yellow and as the game has progressed, he's started to lose a lot more of his duels with Narsingh. He fouls the attacker again and the referee gives him what is surely his final lecture."
30',action,"ROBINSON CALLED INTO ACTION! The former England international keeper makes his first real save of the contest, getting the better of Martin Olsson's testing drive from the left side."
27',action,"A long ball down the line for Vokes gives Burnley a moment to recover, but the forward is soon isolated and robbed of possession. That gives the Swans the chance to force the visitors back again."
25',action,"Swansea keep the visitors penned inside their own box as they pepper the penalty area with a series of crosses and corners. However, Burnley manage to get to those deliveries first and quell the danger."
23',action,"Swansea are still smarting from that decision and the crowd have a fire lit under them now. For those conspiracy theorists out there, the Swans have never won with Anthony Taylor as the lead official."
20',penalty-goal,"Penalty Goal Andre Gray ; GRAY MAKES NO MISTAKE! The striker sends the spot kick that never should have been right down the middle, with Fabianski diving out of the way."
19',action,PENALTY TO BURNLEY! The ball arrived into the Swansea penalty area with a crowd of players going for it. Vokes got his hand to it and the referee signals...only to award a spot kick to the visitors! The Swans appeal furiously but the decision has been made.
17',action,"TREMENDOUS SAVE! That was a speculative effort from Gray that nearly ended up in the back of the net. He lifted it for the far corner, but Fabianski scrambled across just in time to claw it away!"
14',action,"Burnley look to respond down at the other end, with Brady taking aim from just over 25 yards, but it's no trouble for Fabianski, who holds on well. Lovely tempo to this game now as the visitors have to respond."
12',assist,Assist Leroy Fer ; One of the crosses of the season right there.
12',goal,Goal Fernando Llorente Torres ; LLORENTE MAKES THE BREAKTHROUGH! Swansea waste no time in pressing home their momentum as Fer sends in a diamond of a cross that the Spanish striker plants his forehead onto for the lead!
11',action,"TWICE UNLUCKY! Insane misfortune for Swansea as Sigurdsson's free-kick is headed onto the crossbar by Leroy Fer. The home side keep it alive thanks to Jack Cork's hustle, and Narsing prods another effort onto the woodwork!"
10',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Stephen Ward ; Undaunted by that recent snuff by Ward, Narsing goes at him once again, this time drawing a foul which also leads to the first booking of the contest against the defender."
8',action,"Narsing tries to do it all on his own down the right-hand side, but after getting away from one Irishman in Robbie Brady, Stephen Ward, the second, is there to cut him off with a great tackle."
5',action,"Kyle Naughton is asking a little too much of Llorente with a ball into the box. He's got Ben Mee and Michael Keane for company, and that's going to be an interesting battle to watch in this game."
3',action,Swansea are trying to stretch this game out to open up space and get the ball into crossing positions where they can utilise Fernando Llorente's height against the Burnley defence.
1',action,Off we go!
,action,"Veteran keeper Paul Robinson has come in for the injured Tom Heaton, while Ashley Barnes' suspension gives Sam Vokes a start next to Andre Gray in attack. Steven Defour misses out with a hamstring problem."
,action,Luciano Narsingh is promoted to the starting lineup by Clement after some positive performances off the bench since joining from PSV in January. He's the only change from the 3-1 defeat at Chelsea last time out.
,action,"Burnley subs: Flanagan, Westwood, Tarkowski, Darikwa, Pope, Agyei, Arfield."
,action,"Burnley (4-4-2): Robinson; Lowton, Keane, Mee, Ward; Boyd, Hendrick, Barton, Brady; Vokes, Gray."
,action,"Swansea subs: Amat, Ayew, Britton, Borja Baston, Nordfeldt, Routledge, Angel Rangel."
,action,"Swansea (4-3-3): Fabianski; Naughton, Fernandez, Mawson, Olsson; Fer, Cork, Carroll; Narsingh, Llorente, Sigurdsson."
,action,"Burnley have lurched from the commendable to the confounding in recent weeks. A 1-1 draw against Chelsea in the league was followed by an unceremonious exit from the FA Cup at the hands of Lincoln City at Turf Moor. Currently in 11th place, they can go as high as ninth with a win today."
,action,"Swansea have shipped 57 goals this season, a league high. However, since Paul Clement came aboard, the Swans have doubled their points tally, putting a two-point cushion between themselves and the bottom three."
,action,Hello and welcome to our live commentary of the EPL match between Swansea City and Burnley in Wales. The home side are fresh out of the relegation zone and aim to keep it that way against opponents eyeing the top half of the table.
