,action,"Bremen will likely feel hard done by following that defeat as their losing streak against Dortmund continues. Nouri's side did very well to get the equaliser when on the back foot and despite Dronby's sending off, they took the game to BVB in parts. The hosts kept going to the very end but just couldn't find that all important second goal."
,action,The final whistle goes and it's very hard fought three points for BVB as they players embrace in a huddle. Tuchel's men opened the scoring and dominated the game for huge parts. Their man advantage proved huge but it's arguable that the score line could have been a far bigger margin  as the visitors were very wasteful this afternoon.
90'+3',action,Bremen are almost through but the offside prevents them from finding that precious equaliser and their unbeaten streak looks to be over...
90'+2',action,Sane is offside and you can't blame Weidenfeller for taking his time with the goal-kick as he looks to run down the clock. Tuchel is a nervous man on the touchline as he checks his watch. Can Bremen equalise at the death?
90',action,"The fourth official indicates that there will be an additional three minutes played. It's been a long game this afternoon and one that has been played at a fast pace, there will be some aching legs for sure tomorrow. Bremen aren't giving up just yet and the supporters are screaming their team on."
88',action,"Delaney, who has had a lively afternoon, wins another corner. Kruse's delivery is poor again as he chooses to hit low and is straight to a yellow shirt. Dortmund race forward at lightning speed on the counter but Dembele is sluggish and gives the ball away."
87',action,Pulisic makes up for Ginter's carelessness but possession is only retained by the visitors for a short time and Bartels forces a corner. Kruse whips the delivery in as green and white shirts flood the box. It's a poor corner and hits the first man.
86',action,"Schurrle goes for glory and looks to grab his second goal of the afternoon and second in the Bundesliga. The former Premier League star had plenty of options but went for goal. Though his attempt was hard, it was straight at Wiedwald."
84',yellow-card,Yellow Card Santiago García ; Santiago García receives his fourth yellow card of the season following a foul on Piszczek. The defender protests the referee's decision but the official just isn't interested.
82',action,"Durm races down the win with the ball but it's given away in the middle of the park and the hosts are roared forward by their fans. Their efforts are short lived, however, as BVB soon win the ball back and attempt another surge forward."
80',substitution,; The veteran Clemens Fritz is repalced by Florian Kainz in Bremen's final change of the game.
78',action,Demeble fails to control Schurrle's cross and another chance escapes the visitors. Tuchel won't be amused with his men's wastefulness this afternoon and you'd expect this BVB side to be a lot more clinical.
77',action,The visitors use the free-kick as opportunity to calm the tempo and pass the ball around. Schurrle forces Wiedwald into a terrible mistake but his bouncing header can't exploit it and Dembele arrives a little too late. Bremen are living life very dangerously.
76',yellow-card,Yellow Card Thomas Delaney ; Delaney is placed in the referee's book for a needless foul.
74',action,"Two minutes after going in front, Dortmund nearly add to their lead! It's a perfect cross from Durm and you'd expect a bullet header from Pulisic but instead he opts to head it across the face of goal for a teammate to head in but that is not the case. Wasteful from Dortmund again and a let off for the hosts."
71',goal,Goal Łukasz Piszczek ; Dembele wins a corner for BVB with his touch for the afternoon and his delivery is cleared but not for long as Łukasz Piszczek receives the ball and all he has to do its poke it past Wiedwald. He won't get an easier chance that all season. 2-1 Dortmund as Bremen trail again.
70',substitution,; A simple substitution for BVB as Gonzalo Castro makes way for Raphael Guerreiro.
70',substitution,; Marco Reus makes way for Ousmane Dembélé. Reus has had a good afternoon but it's likely he'll feel disappointed having failed to add to the scoresheet.
69',action,"CLOSE! It's a brilliant run from Reus but his timing fails to do that run justice. He gets his head to Ginter's cross but it's across the face of goal and wide. If Reus realised he had more time than he thought, it's very much possible that Bremen would be a goal down again."
66',action,It's a brilliant cross by Kagawa but Durm hits it straight at Bauer who happened to be in the right place at the right time. The visitors need to stop being so wasteful if they are going to take three points today.
65',action,Ginter gives to Schurrle who gives it back to Ginter as Dortmund take a moment to pass the ball around and regain their composure following that equaliser. Ginter attempts a cross but can't time it right for Reus and a following cross into the box ends in a Bremen free-kick after Wiedwald is fouled and drops the ball.
62',action,The Bremen fans have certainly been livened up by that equaliser and making all of the noise. And they're nearly silenced by Kagawa who looks to nip through the host's backline but Sane is able to put it for a corner before the striker has a chance to hit it. The corner is cleared and Bremen can breathe a huge sigh of relief...for now.
59',assist,Assist Clemens Fritz ; Clemens Fritz grabs the header to help Bartels score the equaliser.
59',goal,Goal Fin Bartels ; What a turn around! Bartels latches onto the cross and escapes Ginter and Sokratis with some immense pace and places it well. You can't say Bremen haven't showed any determination and they will feel deserving to be back on level terms. It's a huge blow for Dortmund who have failed to make the most of their chances against a resilient Bremen defence. The visitors have only kept three clean sheets this season and will not add to that tally this afternoon.
59',action,CLOSE! Kagawa exploits Delaney and Kruse's miscommunication and feeds to Reus but he fails to take it round the keeper. You'd expect Reus to do better but he fails to add to his impressive tally of eight goals in 12 games.
58',action,Bremen finally have the ball in the attacking third but Kruse sloppily gives away possession. He attempts to play it through to Bartels but there's no-where near enough power on it and the Dortmund defence will intercept them all day.
55',action,Delaney concedes a free-kick against Pulisic and Moisander immediately complains to the referee. It's a dangerous delivery and one that almost paid dividends but Schurrle failed to get a final touch to it to poke it over the line. It certainly looks like it's going to be a long half for the hosts.
53',action,"It's another free-kick to Dortmund after Fritz gets a foot in on Reus. Rather than going for goal he attempts a cross but Sane heads it clear and moments later the ball is out for a goal-kick. Bremen are struggling to get the ball out of their own half at the minute but fast feet from Kruse seems to do the job, for a second or two at least."
51',action,Kagawa with two successive attempts sees his shot well saved by Wiedwald. Durm races down the wing but Veljkovic cuts him out and concedes a free-kick. The defender escapes with a warning from the referee. Castro's resulting free-kick goes close but just doesn't have enough dip on it.
49',action,"And there it is! It's an excellent spot from Reus as he punts it forward but Schurrle just can't get under in time. If the first few minutes of the second-half are anything to go by, the ball is going to be spending a lot of time in the Bremen half."
47',action,Kagawa plays it to Reus but the attacking midfielder scuffs on the turn and Wiedwald is able to collect. You'd expect much better from the BVB star man and it's likely we'll see better from him this afterroon.
46',action,The second-half is underway. Can Dortmund exploit their man advantage or will Bremen find a way through?
46',substitution,; Marcel Schmelzer makes way Erik Durm at the break.
,action,"Dronby will kicking himself after his moment of madness. His side were looking more and more likely to grabbing that equaliser but having had a man sent off, their task has become a whole lot harder That said, Fritz went agonisingly close to striking his side level, Nouri will be telling his players he wants to see more of that during the second-half."
,action,"BVB head into the first half with a goal advantage and a man advantage. The visitors dominated the opening 20 or so minutes of the game but Bremen began to edge their way back into it with Delaney causing a number of problems for Tuchel's side. Dortmund, however, have stood resilient and Reus has certainly showed his class through the half, linking well with Schurrle."
45'+1',action,"At the other end of the pitch Reus goes close from the right side of the box after collecting the ball from Piszczek. The ball is blocked and Bremen race forward on the counter and it's huge effort from Fritz! If that went in it would undoubtedly be a contender for the goal of the season, it ricochets off the bar and inches in front of the goal line!"
45',action,Not to be deterred by their man and goal disavdtange Delaney tries to take the forward but is out-muscled by two Dortmund defenders and is forced to concede a throw. Elsewhere Kruse is not happy after he adjudges Sokratis to have handled it on the edge of the box. Weidenfeller races in two the separate the pair of Kruse shoves the BVB man.
43',yellow-card,"Yellow Card André Schürrle ; Moments after his free-kick, André Schürrle is placed into the referee's book. It's certainly turning out to be an eventful first-half."
43',action,"Schurrle attempts to work his free-kick into the right corner and curls the ball around the wall but puts a little much too curl on it and it sails narrowly wide. Dortmund fans will be happy Reus is able to continue following Dronby's foul, particularly with the absence of Aubameyang."
42',substitution,; Claudio Pizarro is forced to make way for replacement keeper Felix Wiedwald.
39',red-card,"Red Card Jaroslav Drobný ; RED! Bremen are now a man down as well as a goal down after absolute madness from Jaroslav Drobný. Marcos Reus races onto a cross and looks to take it one-on-one with Dronby but the keeper races out of his box and makes contact with the BVB man, undeniably denying him a goalscoring opportunity."
37',action,"Clemen Fritz is very lucky to escape a yellow card then after leading with his arm challenging for a header with Schurrle, the veteran catching the BVB man's face. The free-kick is aimed goalwards and after a huge scramble in the box Bremen can finally breathe! I've got no idea how that didn't go in. Kagawa delivers a through ball and Pulisic manages to escape Dronby but the offside flag saves the hosts."
36',action,It's Delaney again! He brings down the free-kick with great control and shoots instinctively but it's another great save by Weidenfeller and Moisander haplessly skies the rebound. Nouri is throwing his weight around on the touchline as his side desperately search for an equaliser.
35',action,"Delaney is the man at the centre of everything for Bremen at the minute, he's making some very touches in the attacking half. His efforts were very nearly rewarded from a long range effort but Weidenfeller is able to get his body in front of it. A slow start by Bremen but they're certainly in the game now."
32',action,Ginter is pulled up for a foul on Delaney and the BVB not happy but the referee's decision appeared to the correct on. The resulting free-kick was a great delivery but sailed ever so narrowly wide. Promising stuff from the hosts.
29',action,Thomas Delaney attempts through ball but this time it's Pizarro who is caught offside. The Bremen need to be more alert to the flag because it's caught them on numerous occasions and need to show more energy in the final third if they are to get back into the game.
27',substitution,; It's a huge early blow for Bremen after an early knock forces Serge Gnabry with Milos Veljkovic replacing Bremen's top man.
25',action,It's great defending from Pulisic who cuts out the Bremen attack before it's even started. He was alert to the danger and takes the ball before it reaches Gnabry. The visitors are started to be pegged back a little more by Bremen but they're coping well under any pressure. A throw into the BVB box is reaches Delaney but after heavy pressure from the Dortmund defence the ball is forced all the way back to Dronby.
22',action,Reus is back to his feet following treatment and is able to carry on. Bremen rush forward again as Claudio Pizarro attempts a through ball to Max Kruse but the forward is caught offside. The hosts are edging back into the game now and don't look as sloppy.
19',yellow-card,Yellow Card Robert Bauer ; Robert Bauer is the first player of the afternoon to be carded after a rash foul on Marco Reus.
17',action,Bremen have their first real attempt of the game but it's well saved by Weidenfeller. Better from Bremen. Bartels picked up the ball from Kruse and shot from the right hand side of the box. Nouri will want to see more of that from his men.
16',action,Only Hoffenheim have a longer unbeaten run than Bremen with a total of 16 under their belt compared to the host's five. If Nouri’s men don't book their ideas up this afternoon they're in danger of losing that. It was always going to be a tough game for the hosts but the first half of the first-half has not made for pleasant showing for Bremen fans who look sloppy.
14',action,Poor from Dronby as he clears Piszcek's attempt but only as Piszcek himself who feeds the ball to Kagawa. The forward crosses it in but Schurrle's header from the centre of the box is well held by Dronby. It's looking more and more likely that BVB will grab a second goal.
11',action,CLOSE! Shinji Kagawa feeds the ball through to Maxel Schmelzer who shoots from the centre of the box but Dronby does well to get a hand to it and tips it round the post. The resulting Reus corner is headed narrowly over by Piszcek. Bremen seem to be struggling with BVB's pace of the game.
9',action,The ball is played to Gnabry who feeds it to Kruse under pressure but the resulting cross is well spotted by the visitors and any impending danger is cleared. BVB look to take the ball forward again and are certainly in control of the game now. Reus' return is making a huge difference.
7',action,Dortmund search for a second as they win a corner. The Bremen defence manage to clear the danger but that is short-lived as Pulisic continues to cause the hosts problems. Bremen are finally able to retain possession with a goal kick and use it as an opportunity to compose themselves following that early opener.
5',goal,Goal André Schürrle ; GOAL! It's not so quiet any more as Andre Schurrle grabs the opener. The striker received the ball from Reus and made no mistake in rounding the keeper leaving a helpless Bremen defence able to do nothing but watch.
4',action,The ball is played to Piszczek but the Dortmund man just cannot reach it in time and Drobny collects it. It's been a quiet opening few minutes here as both sides look to find their tempo.
2',action,"It's an early half-chance for Bremen but the Dortmund defence are alert and Serge Gnabry cannot reach it time. The Bremen top scorer has seven goals to his season but his side have won any of the games in which one those goals have come in. That said, the Dortmund defence will note him as the host's danger man."
1',action,Borussia Dortmund get us underway this afternoon...
,action,"Tuchel has opted to make five changes from his side’s last league outing in their 1-1 draw at home to Ausburg. Marco Reus, Andre Schurrle, Gonzalo Castro, Sokratis and Łukasz Piszczek all returning to the fold with Reus and Sokratis having shaken their knocks picked up in the club’s friendly win over Standard Liege. Meanwhile Marc Bartra, Mikel Merino, Christian Pulisic, Mario Gotze and Ousmane Dembele are omitted from the starting 11. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is not in the squad and will be a huge miss for Dortmund."
,action,"There are number of changes to the Werder Bremen side who drew 1-1 with Hoffenheim during their last league run out. Fin Bartels, Thomas Delaney and Clemens Fritz all return to the side with Milos Veljkovic, Zlatko Junuzovic and Philppe Bargfrede missing out."
,action,"SUBS: Bonmann, Bartra, Dembélé, Götze, Guerreiro, Passlack, Durm."
,action,"BVB: Weidenfeller, Piszczek, Sokratis, Ginter, Schmelzer, Weigl, Castro, Pulisic, Kagawa, Reus, Schürrle"
,action,"SUBS: Wiedwald, U. Garcia, Selassie, Veljkovic, Eggestein, Kainz, Manneh."
,action,"Bremen: Drobny, Garcia, Bauer, Delaney, Fritz, Kruse, Pizarro, Moisander, Bartels, Sané, Gnabry."
,action,TEAM NEWS
,action,"BVB have drawn their last four games and be aiming for three points this afternoon. Thomas Tuchel’s men certainly have the firepower to punish the hosts having scored the second most goals in the league with a total of 35. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is the club’s, and league, top scorer currently with a tally of 16 goals. A win could take BVB as high as third today, a spot that Tuchel will certainly have his eyes on."
,action,"Werder Bremen head into the match in good form and are without a defeat in five. Alexander Nouri’s men are 13th in the Bundesliga and a win could take them up to 11th place. However, three points it’s going to be a difficult task as Dortmund will undoubtedly look to get back to winning ways. Die Werderaner have lost their lost three games against BVB and will want to bring that run to an end."
