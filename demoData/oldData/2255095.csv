,action,"As for Bayern, they were absolutely excellent from start to finish. Right from the first whistle, they continuously punished Hamburg with a plethora of fantastic attacking moves, with each and every one of their players putting in brilliant performances. Muller looked to be back to his best, despite not getting on the scoresheet, whilst Lewandowski leaves with the match ball thanks to a spectacular hat-trick that moves him to the top of the Bundesliga top goalscorers chart."
,action,"Hamburg's miserable record at the Allianz Arena continues. Today's defeat was the third time in five encounters that they've conceded at least eight goals in Bavaria, leaving them miserable and lacking confidence at the wrong end of the table. This afternoon was always going to be tough for them, but losing in such a way is unlikely to set them up well for a tough run of upcoming fixtures."
,action,FULL-TIME: BAYERN MUNICH 8-0 HAMBURG
90',action,"Bayern patiently pass the ball around as they try to wind down the clock, and, in an attempt to avoid any further misery being handed to Hamburg, the referee blows his whistle for the final time as soon as the 90th minute arrives."
89',action,"Some Bayern fans have decided to leave the game slightly early, despite their still being a chance of further goals. Hamburg look totally demoralised and are continuously leaving acres of space available at the back."
87',goal,"Goal Arjen Robben ; GOAL! Bayern aren't done yet! A lovely chipped pass from Costa flies over two players before finding Robben, who brings the ball down well and beats Mavraj before slotting a low shot into the bottom left-hand corner of the net. The Dutchman has been great today and fully deserves a goal!"
87',assist,"Assist Douglas Costa de Souza ; That was a fine pass from Costa, who has really impressed today, but once again Hamburg were all over the place at the back, whilst Mavraj was far too weak in trying to stop Robben."
86',action,"After Bayern lose the ball in the middle of the pitch, Hamburg once again try to carve out a late chance on goal, but the home side are able to get plenty of red shirts back to easily deal with the danger."
84',action,"Two crosses are fired into the Hamburg penalty area as Bayern try to increase their lead even further, but they're just about dealt with by the visitors before they attempt to counter-attack through Holtby. The midfielder is unable to do so, however, and loses out to Martinez."
82',action,"Hamburg momentarily get excited after thinking that they've won themselves a late penalty for a foul on Jung, but the linesman's flag is raised and, once again, Bayern are able to deny the visitors a rare chance on goal."
80',action,"Vidal spins round his marker in the middle of the pitch before trying to tee up Robben, but he's fouled just as he pokes the ball towards the Dutchman. The resulting free-kick is sent short and worked over to Costa, and the Brazilian then fails to get the better of Santos on the right-hand side of the penalty area."
78',action,"Bayern are toying with Hamburg as they continue to hold on to possession deep inside the visitors' half of the pitch. The club from the north are struggling to get anywhere near the ball, and they look thoroughly, and understandably, fed up."
76',action,"A half-hearted attempt at an attack from Hamburg quickly comes to an end and allows Bayern to break forward on a swift counter-attack, but Costa is unable to pick out a team-mate and instead sees his cross easily dealt with by Mavraj."
74',action,"Alaba twists and turns over on the left flank before cutting inside and teeing up Coman, but the youngster is unable to control the ball on the edge of the Hamburg penalty area and is dispossessed before he can spin and shoot."

71',action,"The visitors quickly win back possession before Holtby pokes a through-ball into the Bayern penalty area and towards Jung at the near post, but the midfielder loses out to Neuer before catching him on the back of the head with a stray boot."
70',action,"Hamburg desperately break forward from the restart as they try to find a consolation goal - or at least a chance on goal. They're unable to do so, however, as Santos has his run into the box stopped by a well-timed tackle from Rafinha."
69',goal,"Goal Kingsley Coman ; GOAL! Another for Coman! Hummels bursts into the Hamburg half of the pitch before teeing up Muller, who then flicks the ball over to Robben. It bounces off both the Dutchman and Djourou and back to Coman, who then doubles his tally with a lovely volley that leaves Adler rooted to the spot."
67',substitution,; Lahm receives a rousing round of applause from the Bayern fans as he's replaced by Rafinha.
65',goal,"Goal Kingsley Coman ; GOAL! Coman makes it 6-0! A mistake by Djourou allows a lofted pass forward from Hummels find Coman inside the Hamburg box, and the youngster then comfortably beats Adler with a side-footed shot into the bottom right-hand corner of the net."
64',action,"Hunt gets himself into a good position in a pocket of space over on the right flank before trying to thread a pass into the path of Holtby inside the penalty area, but Neuer is there to easily deal with the danger by pouncing on the ball."
62',substitution,"; Hamburg have made a further change, with Aaron Hunt taking the place of Nicolai Muller."
61',action,"Sanches is immediately presented with a chance to test Adler, but his strike from just outside of the penalty area is deflected out for a corner. The set-piece then fails to result in a chance on goal, as it's well dealt with by Hamburg at the near post."
60',substitution,"; Meanwhile, Gregoritsch has made way for Ekdal."
60',substitution,"; Bayern have made their second alteration, with Kingsley Coman coming on to replace Thiago."
59',action,It'll be interesting to see what Bayern do now that they've established such an unassailable lead. They've thoroughly enjoyed themselves against Hamburg in recent years and could go on to beat the 8-0 win they achieved two years ago.
57',substitution,"; Now that he has his hat-trick, Lewandowski will play no further part in the game. He makes way for Renato Sanches in Bayern's first substitution."
56',assist,"Assist Thomas MÃ¼ller ; That was really selfless play by Thomas Muller, who hasn't had the best of seasons but has really impressed this afternoon. He deserved to have a goal of his own, but instead he decided to hand one to Alaba with a clever pass."
56',goal,"Goal David Olatukunbo Alaba ; GOAL! Now it's 5-0! Lewandowski causes problems for the Hamburg defence just outside of the box before teeing up Thomas Muller. The forward darts through the disjointed back line and looks set to take on Adler, but he instead taps the ball over to Alaba and allows the full-back to poke a shot into the back of an empty net."
54',assist,"Assist Arjen Robben ; Robben did really well to set up Lewandowski with his clever pass, but it was a poor mistake by Sakai that allowed him to do so. The Japanese full-back has really struggled this afternoon, and it showed there."
54',goal,"Goal Robert Lewandowski ; GOAL! Hat-trick for Lewandowski! Robben picks up the ball just outside of the Hamburg penalty area before teeing up Lewandowski with a lovely back-heeled flick, and the striker is then able to wrap up his hat-trick with a lovely side-footed strike into the bottom right-hand corner of the net."
53',action,"Gregoritsch goes down inside the penalty area, but nothing is given! Slightly sloppy play by Bayern allows Hamburg to work the ball forward quickly and into the feet of the striker, but he goes down under a challenge from Hummels before he can shoot. The referee isn't at all interested in his pleas for a penalty, however, and waves play on."
51',action,"Great save by Adler! Costa spins round Jung in the middle of the pitch before working the ball out to Robben. The Dutchman is completely unmarked and bombs into the penalty area before rounding Mavraj and shooting, but Adler dives low to his right to tip the ball away from goal."
49',action,"Gregoritsch does well to out-muscle Martinez just outside of the Bayern penalty area before being clattered to the ground by the Spaniard, resulting in a free-kick for the visitors just outside of the box. Gregoritsch steps up and curls a shot towards the top right-hand corner of the net, but Neuer is there to stop the effort from finding the back of the net."
47',action,"Hamburg show positive signs as they burst forward on a quick attacking move. Sakai does well to get himself into a promising position after linking up with Nicolai Muller, but his low shot is poor and trickles wide of the far post."
46',action,We're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"It's safe to say that Bayern will be leaving with all three points after running riot throughout the opening 45 minutes. The home side have completely dominated possession so far, leaving Hamburg looking tired and frustrated as they try, and fail, to deal with the onslaught from the reigning champions. Their back line has crumbled under immense pressure, with each and every Bayern player thoroughly enjoying themselves whenever they push forward."
,action,HALF-TIME: BAYERN MUNICH 3-0 HAMBURG
45',action,"Hamburg lose the ball once again and allow Bayern to break forward quickly, but Sakai is just about able to control a curling cross before the referee brings an end to what has been a miserable first half for the visitors."

42',goal,"Goal Robert Lewandowski ; GOAL! It's another for Bayern! Thomas Muller skips past Santos far too easily as he darts his way into the Hamburg penalty area. He then cuts a pass back to Costa, who sees his first-time strike well saved by Adler. The goalkeeper is only able to push the ball out to Lewandowski, however, and the Polish striker does well to out-muscle Jung before firing a rocket of a volley into the back of the net."
41',action,"A looping cross from Robben finds Thomas Muller, who brings the ball down well before poking it over to Lahm. The full-back is in a pocket of space and easily able to whip a cross over to Vidal at the back post, but the Chilean is penalised for pushing Sakai as the two battle for the ball."
39',action,"After a rare spell of possession for Hamburg, it's all Bayern once again as they patiently pass the ball around and search for an opening in front of them. Thomas Muller darts down the right wing and tries to latch on to a chipped pass forward, but Santos is just about able to cut out the danger with a high boot."
36',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Douglas dos Santos Justino de Melo ; Lahm picks up the ball on the halfway line and tries to spin past Santos before being brought crashing to the ground by a hefty challenge from the Brazilian, who receives the first yellow card of the game as a result."
36',action,"Hamburg are able to push forward on a rare attack as they try to keep the ball as far away from the home side as possible.

34',action,"Thomas Muller dances his way into the right-hand side of the Hamburg penalty area as he easily skips past two defenders. He then takes a quick look up before poking the ball back to Robben, and the Dutchman's quick shot is closed down just as it looks set to cause problems for Adler."
33',action,"Another free header for Lewandowski! Costa gets himself into a good position deep down the left wing and curls a great cross right on to the head of Lewandowski at the back post. The striker is completely unmarked in front of goal, but he doesn't make decent contact with the ball and sends his effort wide of the target."
31',action,"The resulting corner is curled into the penalty area and once again picks out a red shirt in front of goal. This time it's Hummels who manages to get a head to the ball, but his downward header ends up bouncing just wide of the near post."
30',action,"Robben almost makes it 3-0! A mistake by Gotoku Sakai allows Alaba to dart forward unopposed as he flies down the left flank. The Austrian then cuts inside and picks out Robben with a beautiful cross into the box, but Adler does well to tip the Dutchman's bouncing volley over the top of the crossbar."
28',action,"Bayern keep bursting forward and win themselves a free-kick over on the right wing. It's fired into the heart of the penalty area by Robben and finds Lewandowski in front of goal, but he's unable to keep his headed effort down and sends it looping over the top of the crossbar."
26',action,"It's all Bayern as they continue to absolutely dominate the game. Hamburg have barely managed to break out of their own half of the pitch over the past 10 minutes, with the home side easily holding on to possession in dangerous areas."

22',action,"Alaba, who is thoroughly enjoying himself going forward, links up nicely with Vidal in the middle of the pitch as Bayern run rings around their opponents. The Chilean then spins and tees up Lewandowski, but the striker's first touch is poor and knocks the ball away from his feet."

19',action,"After just about managing to deal with the danger, Hamburg try to hit Bayern on a quick counter-attack. They initially do well to break forward before Nicolai Muller takes on Hummels, but he's too slow in trying to pass the centre-back and is easily dispossessed."
18',action,"What a miss by Lewandowski! Bayern immediately win the ball back from the restart and work it into the penalty area, where Lewandowski is waiting at the back post, but, after doing so well to beat his marker, the striker fires a fierce shot off the woodwork from close range."
17',goal,"Goal Arturo Erasmo Vidal Pardo ; GOAL! Bayern have taken the lead! Costa and David Alaba link up well over on the left flank before the Austrian tees up Thomas Muller. He spins on the edge of the penalty area and pokes the ball back to Vidal, who immediately unleashes a low strike that Rene Adler is unable to stop."
17',assist,"Assist Thomas MÃ¼ller ; Thomas Muller showed great vision to set up Vidal with his clever flick, but the Chilean was left in far too much space in a dangerous position just outside of the penalty area."
15',action,"Chance for Bayern! A looping cross flies into the Hamburg box and finds Arturo Vidal, who rises high above his marker before nodding the ball down to Thomas Muller.

5',action,"Arjen Robben darts down the right wing before teeing up Philipp Lahm, who then swings a cross into the middle of the box.

,action,"Thereâs just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so letâs have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoonâ¦"
,action,"After last weekendâs struggles away to Hertha, Bayern will be aiming for a more free-flowing, attack-minded performance against a side that have won only twice of the road so far this season. They will certainly feel confident about their chances of leaving with three points, as the Allianz Arena has proven to be a miserable ground for Hamburg in recent years. Bayern have scored 37 goals in the last seven meetings in Munich, memorably winning 9-2 and 8-0 in 2013 and 2015, respectively."
,action,"Nonetheless, they remain top of the Bundesliga thanks to a difficult period for nearest challengers RB Leipzig, and they certainly find themselves in a better situation thanÂ Hamburg. The Red Shorts currently sit in the relegation play-off spot, just two points clear of the dreaded drop zone, although they have enjoyed an impressive few weeks, with Bayer Leverkusen and Leipzig both losing to Markus Gisdolâs men."
,action,"Despite that, itâs been a slightly underwhelming few weeks for Bayern domestically. The reigning champions also put in a lacklustre display against Schalke at the start of the month, meaning that two of their previous three league games have ended in draws, a sharp contrast to the seven-game winning streak that they embarked on either side of the new year."
,action,"For the second time this season, Robert Lewandowski saved his side at the last possible moment with an injury-time equaliser in last weekendâs clash away to Hertha Berlin. The Polish striker, who now has 16 Bundesliga goals to his name this campaign, made sure that Bayern enjoy a five-pointÂ a lead at the top of the table, stopping Hertha from handing the Bavarians their first league defeat since November."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of todayâs Bundesliga game between Bayern Munich and Hamburg at the Allianz Arena.
