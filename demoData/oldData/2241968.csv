,action,"That's all for our live coverage, thanks for following along. Goodbye!"
,action,"It was a tale of two halves at the London Stadium, as Slaven Bilic's side snatched the initiative following the interval, embarrassing Sam Allardyce's Palace side on the manager's return to east London."
,action,"Second-half goals from Sofiane Feghouli, Andy Carroll - arguably the best of his career - and Manuel Lanzini, and a trio of Michail Antonio assists, ends the Hammers' losing run, while adding to the Eagles' misery."
90'+4',action,FULL-TIME: WEST HAM 3-0 CRYSTAL PALACE.
90'+3',action,"Benteke wins a free-kick on the very edge of the box, a fraction away from being a penalty. Where was that work ethic through the first 90 minutes?"
90'+1',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Joel Ward ; Ward and Byram get into it here, and the former is booked - and luckily enough for Byram, who was already on a yellow."
90',action,There will be three minutes added on at the end of this match.
89',substitution,; West Ham's final change sees Ashley Fletcher replace Antonio.
87',substitution,; And now Lanzini gives way for Edimilson Fernandes. He knew he was coming off and managed to score with his last kick of the match!
87',yellow-card,Yellow Card Manuel Lanzini ; Lanzini is booked for showing joy after scoring.
86',assist,"Assist Michail Antonio ; Three assists for Antonio, who has been unstoppable in this second half since being moved higher up the pitch."
86',goal,"Goal Manuel Lanzini ; GAME, SET, MATCH! Textbook counter-attacking football from the Hammers, who deal with a set-piece and break forward in a flash. Antonio springs Lanzini behind the defence, who produces a sublimely delicate chip to beat Hennessey before sprinting off in celebration!"
84',action,STAT: West Ham had won 32 points after 20 Premier League games this season; 10 more than they have after 20 matches this season (22).
83',action,"This is turning into a dream afternoon for Slaven Bilic, at a time when they so desperately needed something positive. They have just the two shots on target, but they are thoroughly deserving of the victory based on their domination in this second half."
81',substitution,"; A final change here for Palace and it's a debut for Jeffrey Schlupp, who replaces Ledley."
79',assist,Assist Michail Antonio ; Antonio picks up his second assist of the afternoon.
79',goal,"Goal Andy Carroll ; OH MY WORD THAT IS SENSATIONAL! Andy Carroll, take a bow! The striker produces the most incredible overhead scissoring bicycle kick, sending a thumping finish into the ceiling of the goal! You'll be hard-pressed to find a better finish all season!"
76',action,STAT: Crystal Palace have been victorious in just one of their last five league contests against the Hammers (D1 L3).
74',action,"Palace are starting to show a bit more urgency, but they need a lot more than that to provide reason to believe they can turn this around. They still have just the one shot on target, a bit of a surprise as scoring hasn't typically been an issue for the Eagles this season, but Benteke has a partner up top now for these last 15 minutes."
72',action,"Well it's no less than West Ham deserve for the way they've taken control in this second half. They really were uninspiring and unimaginative through 45 minutes, but Slaven Bilic's adjustments have paid dividends for them."
70',substitution,"; Lee Chung-Yong also enters the fray, with McArthur giving way."
70',substitution,"; Palace with a double change here in an attempt to get back into this game, the first of which sees Loic Remy replace Townsend."
70',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Sam Byram ; Byram picks up his usual yellow card, no stranger to a bit of discipline from the referee, this for a shirt tug."
68',assist,"Assist Michail Antonio ; Great run from an impressively calm Antonio, and an unselfish pass, to pick up the assist."
68',goal,"Goal Sofiane Feghouli ; PERSEVERANCE PAYS OFF! WEST HAM BREAK THROUGH! A delicious ball over the top from Noble springs Antonio, with Hennessey inexplicably flying off his line. It's a dreadful decision from the keeper. Antonio rounds him with ease, before unselfishly squaring for Feghouli who beats his man to knock it into the empty net - his first Premier League goal."
66',action,STAT: West Ham's only win in a London derby this season came at Selhurst Park (L3) while Palace have lost all four of their London derbies this season.
64',action,"Lanzini stands over the free-kick after much deliberation, but his end result is poor. It's hardly worth the building anticipation in the end, as his strike, which was too central anyhow, lacks the desired height as it sails over the bar."
62',action,"Carroll's work rate has been absolutely exceptional in this second half. He's chasing down every loose ball and fighting for every inch of space. A great show of determination here sees him arrive at a loose ball a split-second before Tomkins, winning a free-kick on the edge of the box as a result."
60',action,"West Ham have really shown great initiative in this second half. They are taking the game to Palace in a big way now, with Big Sam's side looking a bit vulnerable at the back - a lingering issue for the club this season."
58',action,"BLOCKED! An excellent, looping cross from Feghouli is scrambled clear by Palace, but only as far as Carroll, who hammers a first-time effort at goal from 20 yards, but it doesn't get through the crowd of bodies! The real question is, why was Carroll so deep there, and not in the area trying to get on the end of Feghouli's cross?"
56',action,"STAT: West Ham haven't won any of their last four home league games against the Eagles, last beating them in October 2003 at home (D2 L2)."
54',action,"HIGH AND WIDE! With opportunities so limited, Carroll can't afford to keep missing these chances. A Lanzini cross is poorly defended by Palace (stop me if you've heard that before), who allow it to run through for Carroll at the far post. He quickly switches onto his left, but somehow misses the top corner by more than a few feet!"
52',action,"BETTER! That's more like it from West Ham on the front foot, as Feghouli navigates his way into space before whipping in a terrific cross for Carroll, but Tomkins does just enough to put it behind for a corner."
50',action,"It's all unraveling for both sides when they get into the final third. Chances to break through midfield haven't been plentiful, either, but when they do manage to negotiate a bit of an opening, it's rare to see something come of it."
48',action,"Tomkins puts unnecessary stress on his keeper, selling the backpass a bit short. Carroll was slow to read it, however, and Hennessey is able to charge off his line to clear the threat. Back the other way come Palace and Cabaye squanders a decent shooting opportunity."
46',action,Here we go again...
46',substitution,"; Looks like a switch to a 4-4-2 for West Ham in this second half, as Sam Byram replaces Angelo Ogbonna."
,action,"Through 45 minutes at the London Stadium in a match that has been largely bereft of any attacking quality. Andy Carroll went closest for West Ham, their only scoring chance of the half, and James Tomkins for Palace, but these teams are desperately missing the exploits of their absentee playmakers, Dimitri Payet and Wilfried Zaha."
45'+1',action,HALF-TIME: WEST HAM 0-0 CRYSTAL PALACE.
45',action,"The four official indicates there will be one added minute, as Palace win the game's first corner."
44',action,"Into the final minute of the first half, which is destined to end scoreless. Neither side are deserving of a goal, in fairness. There doesn't figure to be much time added on either, as there have been few stoppages outside of the three bookings."
42',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Andy Carroll ; Carroll puts in a naughty challenge on Ward up against the touchline, a really needless intervention from the striker who has grown increasingly frustrated as this first half has progressed. It's a yellow card, and it could have been worse had Ward not pulled up at the last second to avoid the brunt of the contact."
40',action,STAT: Manuel Lanzini has scored in all three of his Premier League games against the Eagles. Six of his nine Premier League goals have come in London derbies (six goals in 10 apps).
38',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Joe Ledley ; Lanzini has the beating of Ledley, who knew exactly what he was doing there in tugging the winger down to prevent a break, picking up a yellow card in the process."
37',action,"MAD SCRAMBLE! Desperate tracking on this occasion from Antonio, who denies Benteke from getting on the end of Townsend's superb delivery, but in turn knocks the ball away from Randolph and back towards goal. Three Hammers players scramble across, before the danger is finally cleared."
35',action,"SOMEHOW IT STAYS OUT! Inexplicable defending from Antonio, who completely lets Tomkins go at the far post. The centre-half gets on the end of the ensuing free-kick from two yards, but his redirection rolls across the face of goal and just wide at the far post!"
34',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Mark Noble ; And it's a booking for Noble, as well."
33',action,"Noble has been in the face of Swarbrick throughout the first half, pleading the referee to take action on a number of occasions, to no avail. Well, Swarbrick has his say here as Noble slides into a challenge on Townsend, with the referee pausing for a moment before awarding a free-kick to Palace on the edge of the box."
31',action,"Desperate appeals for handball from Carroll, who latches onto the end of a Noble free-kick at the far post, but penalty shout is nothing if not a longshot, as the striker's header struck the back of Dann, who knew little about it anyhow. Frustration gets the better of Carroll, who is penalised for a foul of his own seconds later."
29',action,STAT: Crystal Palace had won 15 points more at this stage last season (31) than they currently have after 20 games in 2016-17 (16).
27',action,"FIRST CHANCE! Easily the best opportunity of the afternoon thus far, and it nearly results in the opening goal! Lanzini makes strides down the right and quickly picks out a cross for Carroll, who lifts a first-time volley just an inch or two over the bar!"
25',action,"These West Ham supporters have once again found their voice, recognising their side may be in need of a lift yet again. The Hammers are far too contemplative in possession, lacking quality and ingenuity in the final third."
23',action,"The midfield battle is tight and congested, with players being made to fight for every inch. Palace have the greater width about them going forward, through the likes of Puncheon and Townsend, but Cresswell and Antonio are doing a masterful job of tracking back to negate the threat."
21',action,"This match has a real combative feel to it, with both sides unable to afford another defeat. Through 20 minutes now and we haven't had so much as an opening in attack, let alone a shot on target."
19',action,"STAT: Since he arrived in the Premier League, Dimitri Payet has created the most goalscoring chances (193) - a category he also leads in 2016-17 alone (74). In his three Premier League appearances against Crystal Palace, Payet has scored two goals, had 10 shots and created 13 goalscoring chances."
17',action,"There's been plenty of pedestrian spells in possession thus far at the London Stadium,. There hasn't been much cohesion on the ball and both sides seem to be lacking that link between midfield and attack."
15',action,"Palace are in the ascendency here, with West Ham's intensity really dropping off a bit over the last five minutes. The visitors are keen to get and stay on the front foot, though they've been unable to pick out that decisive final ball in attack."
13',action,"SUPERB RUN! Excellent initiative from Puncheon, who runs east-west across the Hammers defence, before turning up the pitch as Dann plays a ball over the top to pick him out. He ambitiously tries to take it first time on the volley, but ends up skying his effort."
11',action,"Ledley commits himself to a rash challenge, sliding through the back of Feghouli, but play on says referee Neil Swarbrick, who has let a lot of stuff go through the first 10 minutes. That was a dangerous slide from the Palace midfielder, who will count himself lucky to escape without a booking."
9',action,"STAT: Sam Allardyce has been beaten just once in his last 10 Premier League games against former side West Ham, though this was with Sunderland in February 2016 (W5 D4 L1)."
7',action,"Two sound pieces of defending from Collins and Reid, who show great strength to beat Benteke in the air. The Belgian striker has a pair of deliveries to feast on, but he lacks the compete and desire necessary to get on the end of them."
5',action,"There's a real intensity about West Ham in the opening stages here, moving well on the ball and working hard off it. It will be interesting to see how they cope in the final third without the playmaking expertise of Dimitri Payet - so far Hennessey has yet to be tested."
3',action,"The heaviest home FA Cup defeat in club history and a transfer request from their best player has not put a damper on the atmosphere this afternoon. These fans, known as some of the Premier League's best, are showing excellent support for their Hammers, who have responded with a positive start."
1',action,"AND THEY'RE OFF! Palae in their changed yellow strip today, attacking right to left as they get us underway, with West Ham in claret and blue."
,action,"Sam Allardyce makes eight changes from their FA Cup tie at Bolton, with just Joel Ward, Damien Delaney and Joe Ledley keeping their place in the team. Christian Benteke has recovered from a shoulder problem to lead the line, supported by Andros Townsend, Yohan Cabaye and Jason Puncheon. Wilfried Zaha and Bacary Sako are away at the Africa Cup of Nations."
,action,"Slaven Bilic makes three changes to his side following the lopsided FA Cup defeat to Manchester City. Darren Randolph starts in goal ahead of Adrian, James Collins returns from injury at the expense of Havard Nordtveit, and Mark Noble is restored, with Edimilson Fernandes dropping to the bench. Michail Antonio starts despite originally being considered a doubt with an illness."
,action,"SUBS: Speroni, Flamini, Remy, Chung-Yong, Fryers, Schlupp, Kelly."
,action,"CRYSTAL PALACE (4-2-3-1): Hennessey; Ward, Tomkins, Dann, Delaney; McArthur, Ledley; Townsend, Cabaye, Puncheon; Benteke."
,action,"SUBS: Adrian, Byram, Calleri, Oxford, Quina, Fernandes."
,action,"WEST HAM (3-4-3): Randolph; Collins, Reid, Ogbonna; Antonio, Noble, Obiang, Cresswell; Lanzini, Feghouli, Carroll."
,action,CONFIRMED TEAM NEWS:
,action,"But opportunity strikes for the Eagles today, and Sam Allardyce should have his side extra motivated as he faces his former club. Big Sam had some great memories in east London, but he would love nothing more than to add to their misery this afternoon."
,action,"Crystal Palace are still looking for their first win under Sam Allardyce, as they hover just a point above the bottom three. You have to go all the way back to December 3 to find their last victory, and September 24 before that - an ominous sign for a club aiming to avoid relegation."
,action,"A pitiful 5-0 defeat at home to Manchester City in the FA Cup last weekend made it three losses in a row for West Ham, and now they will have to make do without their unsettled playmaker, who has been left out of the squad as he nears an east London departure."
,action,"West Ham are marred in a transfer saga, and the timing couldn't be much worse. Dimitri Payet's request to leave has cast a dark cloud over the Hammers' campaign, though Slaven Bilic has been admirably professional in dealing with it."
,action,Hello and welcome to live coverage from the London Stadium for the return of Sam Allardyce to east London as West Ham play host to Crystal Palace.
