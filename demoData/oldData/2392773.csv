,action,"In the end, it was a very comfortable afternoon for City, who, after finally managing to break down Palace, never looked like losing. Sam Allardyce's tough start to life in South London goes on, and his side didn't look any better today than they have in recent weeks. They've got a lot of work to do if they're to avoid dropping back down to the Championship."

90',yellow-card,Yellow Card Joe Ledley ; Yellow card Joe Ledley
88',action,"What an opportunity for Gabriel Jesus! Toure pushes forward before slotting a lovely pass through the Palace defence and into the feet of the Brazilian. He rounds quickly Hennessey before trying to shoot, but he loses his footing at the vital moment and is unable to make it 3-0 with his first ever City goal."
86',action,"City remain in complete control as we enter the final few minutes of the game. Palace now look content to sit deep and try to limit the damage, as they've barely troubled the visitors' back line all half."
84',substitution,"; City have made a late change, with Sane making way for Nolito."
82',action,"Palace push forward on a rare foray into the City half of the pitch and win themselves a free-kick in an advantageous position. It's poorly executed by the home side, however, allowing the visitors to easily deal with the danger before breaking forward once again."
80',action,It's all City at the moment as they comfortably pass the ball around inside the Palace half of the pitch. They don't look in any danger of losing their two-goal lead as we enter the final 10 minutes of the game.
79',substitution,; Silva receives a rousing round of applause from the City fans as he's replaced by Fernando.
77',action,"With two goals under their belts, City don't look to be in too much of a rush to push forward. Palace, clearly dejected and bereft of confidence, also aren't pushing hard for a way back into the game, and it seems as if they believe the contest is as good as over."
76',substitution,"; Palace have made their third and final change, with Schlupp making way for Zeki Fryers."
75',action,"Silva gets himself into a good position and decides to try and test Hennessey with a 30-yard strike, but it isn't hit cleanly enough by the Spaniard and the Palace goalkeeper is able to watch the shot fly well wide of the goal."
73',action,"City continue to dominate possession as they push forward in search of a third goal to wrap up the win. With little over 15 minutes left to play, it certainly looks as if they're going to leave Selhurst Park with a well-deserved victory."

70',action,"City are dominating the game at the moment and look close to scoring a second goal. You feel that one more would seal the win for them, as Palace have created very little inside the final third this afternoon."
68',action,"Townsend darts down the right wing as he tries to get Palace back into the game, but he's unable to direct his cross past Gael Clichy and the Frenchman is easily able to deal with the danger on the edge of the City box."
66',substitution,"; Meanwhile, Jesus Navas has come on to replace Sterling for City."
65',substitution,"; Palace have made their second alteration of the afternoon, with Mutch making way for James McArthur."
64',action,"Palace are starting to get into the game a little bit more after suffering a slow start to the second half, but they're still finding it tough to find a way through the City back line, which has barely been tested this afternoon."
62',action,"Chance for Ledley! The midfielder gets himself into a pocket of space 25 yards away from the City goal and tries to test Caballero with a long-range strike, but his thumping effort ends up flying just wide of its intended target."
60',action,"It's been raining heavily since half-time, which has made life very tough for both sides. Passes along the ground have been affected by the sodden nature of the pitch, disrupting the game's flow."
58',action,"City push forward through Silva, who takes on Schlupp before being fouled by the defender, resulting in a free-kick for City in an advantageous position. The visitors are unable to make it count, however, and the hosts calmly deal with the danger."
57',yellow-card,Yellow Card Bacary Sagna ; Yellow card Bacary Sagna
54',yellow-card,Yellow Card Martin Kelly ; Yellow card Martin Kelly
53',action,"Chance for Sagna! The defender does well to get a head on the corner after darting towards the ball, but he's unable to hit the target and Palace are just about able to hold on."
52',action,"City come back once again as they continue putting pressure on the hosts. This time it's Delph who tests Hennessey, but the midfielder's low strike is parried out for yet another corner."
51',action,"And now City go close! After dealing with the danger, Sterling picks up the ball in a great position in front of goal, but he tries to back-heel a strike towards goal instead of teeing up Silva and has to settle for a corner."
50',action,"What an opportunity for Remy! City aren't able to deal with a curling cross from Ward, allowing Match to tee up Remy. The substitute is all alone in front of goal, but he sometimes fires his shot over the top of the crossbar."
48',action,"Silva gets himself into a dangerous position and chips a delightful cross over to Gabriel Jesus, who is in a good position in front of goal, but the Brazilian's headed effort is deflected away and out for a corner."
47',action,"The game gets going but is then quickly brought to a halt after the referee realises that Remy's studs weren't checked before he came on to the pitch. Everything seems to be in order though, and play resumes once again!"
46',substitution,"; Palace have made one substitution during half-time, with Benteke making way for Loic Remy."
46',action,And we're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half.
,action,"Despite not being at their best for most of the first half, City were certainly the better of the two sides during the opening 45 minutes and head down the tunnel with a well-deserved one-goal lead under their belts. They did well to carve open the Palace defence, which had largely performed well, with a quick break through the middle of the pitch, with Gabriel Jesus' lovely pass to Sterling being matched by a great finish from the winger."
,action,HALF-TIME: CRYSTAL PALACE 0-1 MANCHESTER CITY
45'+2',action,"City push forward once again as they aim to end the first half with a second goal, but Delph is unable to test Hennessey with his long-range effort and it's instead deflected well wide of the Palace goal."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be two minutes of added time.
44',action,"City almost make it 2-0! Another impressive passing move sees the visitors penetrate the penalty area before Gabriel Jesus unleashes a shot, but Hennessey does well to dive in front of the strike to stop it from finding the back of the net."
43',assist,Assist Gabriel Fernando de Jesus ; Assist Gabriel Fernando de Jesus
43',goal,Goal Raheem Shaquille Sterling ; Goal Raheem Shaquille Sterling
42',action,"City have looked dangerous when pushing forward with intent, but too often they've sat back when in possession and haven't tried to open up the Palace defence. As a result, Sam Allardyce will certainly be the happier of the two managers at the moment."
40',action,"Kolarov gets himself into a good position 30 yards away from goal and tries to whip a cross into the middle of the penalty area, but it's completely mishit by the Serbian and what ends up being more a shot flies comfortably over the top of the crossbar."
38',action,"It hasn't been a great 10-minute period for City, who seem to have lost the intensity that characterised their early forays forward. Palace have comfortably matched their opponents in the middle of the pitch, where they're winning plenty of battles."
36',yellow-card,Yellow Card Raheem Shaquille Sterling ; Yellow card Raheem Shaquille Sterling
34',action,"Tomkins goes close! Palace push forward on another impressive attacking move before winning themselves a second free-kick in quick succession, this time over on the left flank. It's fired in by Chung-Yong Lee and pinballs around the box before falling to Tomkins, but the defender's thumping strike is well saved by Caballero."
32',action,"Chance for Benteke! The cross from the free-kick is a good one and finds Benteke in front of goal, but the big Belgian is unable to hit the target with his effort and instead sends it looping over the top of the crossbar."
31',action,"Big call by the referee! Palace hit City on another great counter-attack and fly down the right wing, but Toure is there to stop it with a hefty challenge. The home players and fans all scream for a second yellow card, but the referee isn't interested and just awards a free-kick."

28',yellow-card,Yellow Card Gnégnéri Yaya Touré ; Yellow card Gnégnéri Yaya Touré
26',action,"The corner is whipped in towards the near post and almost finds a Palace player in front of goal, but the City defence just about do enough to clear the ball before the referee awards them a free-kick for pushing inside the box."
25',action,"A half-hearted City attack comes to an end, allowing Palace to counter quickly. They do well through Christian Benteke, who then quickly sets up Townsend, but the winger's cross is blocked and he has to settle for a corner."
23',action,"The pace of the game has slowed down somewhat, with Palace now managing to get back into things. City are still seeing most of the ball but the home side look far more defensively solid than they have in recent weeks."
21',action,"Palace are able to push forward on a rare foray into the City half of the pitch and do well to win themselves a free-kick in a dangerous position on the right wing. It's whipped into the middle of the box and finds Martin Kelly, but the defender's looping header is easy caught by Willy Caballero."
19',action,"After spending what feels like an age on the ball, Silva is eventually able to cut inside from the right wing before curling a cross right on to the head of Sane. The German can't direct his effort towards goal, however, and sends it bouncing wide of the near post."
17',action,"City continue patiently working the ball around inside the Palace half of the pitch as they try to find a way through the hosts once again, but they're unable to do so and, due to good defending, have to work the ball back towards the halfway line."
15',action,"Fabian Delph goes close! Sterling gets himself into a good position over on the right wing before curling a cross right on to the head of Delph, but the midfielder's connection isn't the best and he ends up scuffing the ball comfortably wide of the near post."
13',action,"Palace, who have barely been able to break out of their own half of the pitch so far, are finally able to do so through Andros Townsend. The winger is initially beaten to the ball by Sagna but does well to put the Frenchman under pressure, resulting in a throw-in for the home side deep down the left flank."
11',action,"Chance for Silva! Yaya Toure fires a wonderful pass over the top of the Palace back line and into the path of Silva, who then diverts a shot goalwards. It's well hit by the Spaniard but Hennessey does well to parry it away with a smart save."
9',action,"City win themselves a corner over on the right wing, and it's fired into a dangeorous position inside the Palace box. It bounces around near to the penalty spot as three different City players try to get it under control, but the home side are just about able to clear the danger before a shot can be taken."
7',action,"City continue to put plenty of early pressure on Palace as they try to find a breakthrough. Silva has been particularly impressive thus far, with Sterling also look up for the challenge."
5',action,"It's been a great start to the game for City, who are dominating proceedings inside the Palace half of the pitch. Once again, Silva plays an important role in an attacking move before winning his side a corner, which is well gathered by Hennessey."
3',action,"Great opportunity for Leroy Sane! David Silva shows some wonderful footwork before teeing up Raheem Sterling, who then curls a cross right on to the head of Sane, but the German is unable to test Wayne Hennessey and loses out in front of goal."
2',action,"City start the game brightly as they try to put Palace under some early pressure, but, after doing well to get down the right wing, Bacary Sagna is unable to swing a cross into the box and it's cut out by James Tomkins."
1',action,And we're off!
,action,"The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."
,action,"Meanwhile, City boss Pep Guardiola has made five alterations to the team that featured in their last outing, with the most notable inclusion being Vincent Kompany, who is set to make his first appearance since November 19th. He takes the place of Nicolas Otamendi, whilst Claudio Bravo, Pablo Zabaleta, Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Aguero also make way for Willy Caballero, Bacary Sagna, Fabian Delph and Gabriel Jesus, the latter of whom will make his first ever start for his new club."
,action,"Sam Allardyce has decided to make six changes to the Palace side that started the defeat against Everton last weekend, with Martin Kelly, Mathieu Flamini, Joe Ledley, Jordon Mutch, Chung-Yong Lee and Andros Townsend coming into the starting line-up to replace Scott Dann, Damien Delaney, Yohan Cabaye, Jason Puncheon, James McArthur and Loic Remy, respectively."

,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"Despite their recent struggles in the league, City have enjoyed an easy time in the FA Cup this season. West Ham United, their only opponents so far, were easily thrashed 5-0 in the last round, and Pep Guardiola will be hoping that his side can pull off a similar result this afternoon as they aim to get their campaign back on track with a much-needed win."
,action,"There have been plenty of grumbles ringing around the Etihad in recent weeks, with many City fans not happy with the fifth-place position their team currently occupies. An embarrassing 4-0 defeat against Everton two weeks ago was followed by a frustrating 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur, leaving them desperate for a positive result here today."
,action,"Despite managing to hold on for 87 minutes, Saturday saw Palace suffer their fourth consecutive league defeat, with Everton becoming the latest side to leave Selhurst Park with all three points. As a result, they currently sit inside the relegation zone and must face a City side that, whilst not at their best, nonetheless boast the necessary firepower to inflict more misery on their struggling opponents."
,action,"Life in South London is proving to be tough for Sam Allardyce, who has failed to win a single Premier League game since taking charge at Palace. Just one of the seven games he’s overseen has ended in a victory, with a replay against Bolton Wanderers in the last round just about finishing 2-1 to the Eagles thanks a second-half Christian Benteke double."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s FA Cup fourth round clash between Crystal Palace and Manchester City at Selhurst Park.
