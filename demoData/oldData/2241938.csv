,action,"Full-time at Vicarage Road. Sam Allardyce gains a point in his first game in charge of Crystal Palace as the Eagles draw 1-1 away to Watford in this Boxing Day clash. The goalscorers on the day were Cabaye and Deeney, but the visitors probably should have got at least one more if not for a poorly missed penalty from Benteke. Thanks for joining us!"
90'+2',action,"FOUR minutes of added time have been allocated by the referee here and that may not be enough for both sides as everyone looks to be going all-out for the victory in these latter stages! A cracking tempo to proceedings currently, but time is running out for a winning goal!"
90'+1',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Miguel Ángel Britos Cabrera ; There has been an ongoing battle between Britos and Benteke this afternoon, and the former eventually sees yellow after needlessly coming through the back of the Palace striker, whish results in a free-kick for the visitors."
89',action,"Capoue passes into the feet of Amrabat and the former Malaga man displays some dazzling footwork to evade as many as three challenges just outside the centre circle. Sinclair eventually sees posssession down the left wing, but the subsequent clearance from the cross is made by Dann."
87',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Wilfried Zaha ; Now, Zaha does have a reputation of going down far too easily when some tackles are made on him, and the referee shares this view here as he brandishes the yellow card for a dive to the Palace winger after a tackle from Holebas. SLIGHTLY harsh as there was a tiny bit of contact,"
85',substitution,"; Five minutes to go now and Walter Mazzarri makes his third and final change. Entering the action is the attack-minded Jerome Sinclair and he will replace Zuniga, who was introduced to the action very early on to replace the injured Janmaat."
83',action,"As probably expected, there has been plenty of aerial battles so far this afternoon as both sides have deployed extremely physical centre-forwards up top. There hasn't been anything too sinister in the collisions, but they are making for some very nasty, awkward falls to the floor, with Deeney the latest victim of the hard surface."
81',substitution,; Another change from Allardyce and this one actually comes with a certain amount of attacking ambition. A defensive midfielder is replaced by a striker on this occasion as Flamini makes way for Fraizer Campbell.
79',action,"The Watford fans are, rather half-heartedly, looking for Benteke to be given a second yellow card here after the Belgian collides with Gomes inside the penalty box of the home side. There was nothing in the altercation, though, and the referee correctly waves away the protests to move the play along."
77',action,"Delaney isn't having a great time at the moment at the back for Palace as his confidence has been completely shot from that conceded penalty. Indeed, whenever there is a delivery being sent into the area of the Eagles, the defender is looking much more apprehensive about putting a meaningful challenge in!"
75',action,"Fifteen minutes to go in this enthralling Premier League encounter and the game is perfectly balanced at 1-1 with the closing stages creeping up quickly. The ascendancy is definitely with Watford after that goal from Deeney, with Palace really needing to sort themselves out to prove to be a threat again."
73',substitution,"; First change of the match from Allardyce and it sees Townsend replaced by Jordon Mutch. A slightly defensive move from Allardyce, perhaps, but Puncheon will likely be the man tasked with moving into a more advanced area from the right wing."
71',penalty-goal,"Penalty Goal Troy Deeney ; GOOOOAAAAAAAAALLLL FOR WATORD! We are all-square! Deeney steps up and smashes the penalty right down the middle for his 100th Hornets goal! And what a celebration, too! One-one!"
70',yellow-card,Yellow Card Damien Delaney ; PENALTY TO WATFORD! Delany is guilty of some pulling inside the box and the referee correctly spots the foul on Prodl!
68',action,"Watford are looking dangerous at the moment and currently have Palace camped inside their own penalty area. As mentioned in the first half, Amrabat looks the best bet for the home side to unlock the opposition defence, but again Hennessey hasn't beet tested to a high degree!"
66',action,Palace fail to clear with a succession of headers and attempted punts up the park and possession eventually falls to Zuniga. The substitute goes for the first-time attempt on goal from around 25 yards out but unfortunately for him and the Watford fans the attempt goes high into row Z.
64',action,"Allardyce will be worried that Palace have once again failed to capitalise on a decent period of dominance. Apart from Gomes' penalty save, the Watford goalkeeper hasn't had a great deal to do in between the sticks for the home side."
62',action,"Both sides definitely fancy their chances from set-pieces here today as it seems to be from corners and free-kicks that the biggest threat is being posed. We are indeed witnessing two squads who have been terrible at defending from these situations this campaign, so perhaps the goals will start flowing soon!"
60',action,"Gomes, who gave away that penalty in the first half, almost sells the jerseys again with a clearance from inside the box which goes straight to the foot of a Palace player in midfield. Luckily for the former Spurs goalkeeper, his team-mates bail him out on this occasion."
58',action,It has been a fairly tepid opening to the start of the second period at Vicarage Road as both sides continue to probe to try and find their next goal. Not a lot of quality on display in the middle of the pitch as both sides are surrenderng possession too frequently.
56',action,"Ighalo, who has been quiet so far, manages for one of the first times in the match to get in behnd this Palace deence. Watford's top goalscorer of last season gets the strike away on this occasion, but the lack of confidence is evident as the attempt is weakly lashed the wrong side the post."
54',action,Amrabat dances his way through a few challenges near the right touchline before moving inside to clip a cross to the back post. Deeney is lurking unmarked just a yard into play and manages to recycle back into the danger area but there are no taker s for Palace!
52',yellow-card,Yellow Card José Holebas ; The first Watford booking of the match goes to Holebas for leaving something on Puncheon after the Palace man had cleared up the park.
50',action,"Zaha goes on another marauding run coming in from the left wing but like Benteke previously in the first half, takes too long to eventually get the shot away. Towsend takes matters into his own hands and pulls the trigger, but the attempt goes high and wide over the crossbar."
48',action,"Guedioura takes the ball in to feet down the left wing and displays an impressive turn of pace to shake off the challenge fom Dann. Eventually, the Palace captain commits the needless foul near the byline and Watford now have the opportunity to get a decent ball into the box from a tight angle."
46',action,We are back under way in this Boxing Day clash!
,action,"Half-time at Vicarage Road. Crystal Palace look on course to get back to winning ways in Allardyce's first game in charge as they head into the break 1-0 up over Watford thanks to a nice finish from Cabaye. The visitors had the chance to double the lead, but a poor penalty from Benteke was saved by Gomes so this match is still very much in the balance!"
45'+3',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Jason Puncheon ; Another booking for Palace, with this time Puncheon being the guilty party."
45'+2',action,FIVE minutes of added time have been allocated by the referee and the announcement of this catalyses an encouraging cheer from the Vicarage Road faithful. They want that equaliser in the opening half!
45',yellow-card,Yellow Card Christian Benteke Liolo ; First booking of the match goes to Benteke and the offence is pushing and pulling away at Holebas right in front of the linesman. That missed penalty is certainly proving to be a source of frustration.
43',action,"Watford will be hoping to bag an equaliser before the half-time oranges and, due to the injuries to both Janmaat and Behrami, we will probably see a healthy amount of stoppage time before the end of the half."
41',action,"The game is all a bit scrappy at the moment which will suit Palace more as they will be happy for the remaining moments of the first half to fade away without incident. Allardyce will be furious at that missed penalty, though, as it came via another one of those in-vogue stuttered run-ups!"
39',action,"Things could have been fairly miserable for Watford if that penalty went in and they would be going into the break 2-0 down. However, the excellent stop from Gomes has injected some life into this Hornets performance and they look good value to claim an equaliser sooner rather than later."
37',missed-penalty,"Missed Penalty Christian Benteke Liolo ; Penalty MISSED by Benteke! That stuttered run-up fails to come off for the big Belgian on this occasion as Gomes saves,"
37',penalty-save,Penalty save Heurelho da Silva Gomes ; SAAAAAAAAAAVE BY GOMES! The Brazilian makes up for his error by getting down to his left-hand side to block the penalty from Benteke!
36',action,"PENALTY TO CRYSTAL PALACE! An awful back pass from Prodl sees Gomes forced out of his goal to confront Benteke, but the goalkeeper only succeeds in completely taking out the former Liverpool striker. As clear a penalty as you will see this Boxing Day!"
34',action,"Zaha breaks free down the left wing for the first time in the match and looks to take on the Watford defence with a twisting and turning run. He eventually cuts inside on his right foot before pulling the trigger from 20 yards, but a block from Prodl sees the ball filter comfortably through to Gomes between the sticks."
32',action,"Amrabat is the man pulling the strings for Watford at the moment and looks the best bet to unlock this currently sturdy Palace defence. The former Malaga man is seeing quite a bit of the ball down this right-hand channel, but Zaha has been vigilant in his tracking back so no joy as of yet for the hosts."
30',action,"Watford were poor in the early stages of play and deserve to be losing, but their response to going a goal behind can be a source of encouragement for Mazzarri in the dugout. A good period of sustained pressure from the hosts at the minute, but they need to convert this into goalscoring chances as Hennessey hasn't had a save to make."
28',action,"Puncheon concedes the cheap foul on Guedioura and Watford get the free-kick just outside the centre circle. All three central defenders for the hosts move up for the set-piece and it is Holebas who is eventually tasked with the delivery, but a good piece of defending from Dann at the back post sees Palace clear."
26',assist,Assist Andros Townsend ; Neat assist for Townsend.
26',goal,Goal Yohan Cabaye ; GOOOOOAAAAAAALLLLL FOR CRYSTAL PALACE! The Eagles open the scoring! A poor offside trap from Watford allows Cabaye to break in behind and latch on to a pass from Townsend before lashing a finish into the bottom left corner! One-nil.
24',action,"JUST WIDE FROM CABAYE! Benteke picks up the ball in the middle of the pitch before driving forward with pace, looking to gain a yard of space to get the shot away. The Belgian waits too long for a clear opportunity which allows Prodl to clear, but the former PSG midfielder still manages to get the shot away from the loose bit of possession, even if it does eventually go wide."
22',action,"Sam Allardyce will be slightly concerned that Palace haven't managed to take the lead during their early period of dominance. Watford looked on the ropes after having to make two very early substitutions, but the Eagles have barely tested the resolve of the hosts with any goalscoring chances."
20',action,"A nice move from Palace now as Cabaye links up well with Puncheon before threading a pass down the right for the onrushing Kelly. The subsequent cross from the right-back is swung ominously into the penalty area, but Prodl displays a cool head to chest the ball down before clearing up the park. Good defending in the end."
18',action,"Watford are the walking wounded at the moment as Kaboul now goes down after a very nasty fall on to the solid pitch after an aerial altercation with Benteke. Thankfully, the former Tottenham defender manages to shake off the cobwebs to continue the fight."
16',action,"This season, Deeney and indeed Ighalo have came nowhere near matching the same form which lit up the Premier League at points last season. Their indifferent performances have meant that they actually haven't featured together up top too many times this campaign, but Mazzarri will be hoping for a return to form sooner rather than later from his striking duo."
14',substitution,"; After a delay, Troy Deeney eventually gets stripped to enter the action and replace Behrami."
12',action,"Some more injury woe for Watford here as it looks like Behrami has now picked up an injury after clutching at his hamstring, A very strange state of affairs among the Hornets' players. Did they warm up correctly, or does this go down as simple bad luck?"
10',action,"A lovely tempo to the opening proceedings in this Boxing Day clash, with Palace clearly playing with a spring in their step on impress the new manager, Allardyce. Watford, meanwhile, haven't managed to recover from that injury to Janmaat as of yet."
8',action,"Townsend picks up the ball deep down the right wing and typically cuts inside on his left foot before whipping a cracking cross into the box, with Benteke the target at the back post. However, Gomes takes the pressure off his defence by proactively coming off his line to claim possession out of the air,"
6',action,"A good period of early pressure from Palace here as they camp Watford inside their own penalty area with a succession of set-pieces. A Cabaye free-kick and two corner-kicks from Puncheon are whipped dangerously into the box, but the hosts are eventually relieved of pressure after a cheap foul from Dann."
4',substitution,; Confirmation that Zuniga has came on to replace Janmaat at right wing-back.
3',action,"Unfortunately for Watford, they are going to have to make a change at this very early stage as Janmaat appears to have picked up a groin injury. The Dutchman has had quite a few injury problems so far this season so that is not nice to see, and it looks like Zuniga is the man getting ready to come on for the hosts."
1',action,We are under way at Vicarage Road!
,action,"The last clash between Watford and Crystal Palace was actually the semi-final of the FA Cup back in April. On that occasion at Wembley, goals from Yannick Bolasie and Connor Wickham were enough for the Eagles to progress to the final with a 2-1 victory over the Hornets. Alan Pardew's outfit at the time would go on to lose the final against Manchester United."
,action,"Palace subs: Speroni, Fryers, Mutch, Husin, Lee, Wan-Bissaka, Campbell."
,action,"Crystal Palace (4-3-3): Hennessey; Ward, Dann, Delaney, Kelly; Flamini, Cabaye, Puncheon, Townsend, Zaha, Benteke."
,action,"Watford subs: Pantilimon, Deeney, Cathcart, Doucouré, Zúñiga, Sinclair, Kabasele."
,action,"Watford (3-5-2): Gomes; Kaboul, Prodl, Britos; Janmaat, Capoue, Behrami, Guedioura, Holebas; Ighalo, Amrabat."
,action,TEAM NEWS...
,action,"Both sides featuring this afternoon are currently in the bottom half of the table in the Premier League. Watford are positioned fairly comfortably in 12th but have lost four out of their last five so will be looking to improve before being dragged towards the dropzone. Palace, meanwhile, are embroiled in a relegation battle and are just one point above the bottom three."
,action,"The Eagles got a fairly sizeable Christmas present over the festive period and it came in the form of Sam Allardyce who was appointed manager a few days ago after the departure of Alan Pardew. In 2016, Palace had one of the worst records in the whole of English football with defensive frailties continually shining through, but now they have a manager who can certainly add solidity to any backline."
,action,Good afternoon football fans! Welcome to LIVE coverage of the Premier League Boxing Day clash between Watford and Crystal Palace from Vicarage Road!
