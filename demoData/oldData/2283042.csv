Modric shoots from a tight angle on the right, but Mascherano blocks."

,action,"HALF-TIME! El Clasico is goalless at the break, with Real Madrid having the better of few first-half chances at Camp Nou.

34',action,"Marcelo is found scampering into the penalty area for Real Madrid, but Pique steps out to make a timely tackle that deflects off the Brazilian.

32',action,"Wide from Marcelo! Ronaldo is picked out by a cross from right-hand side, which the Portuguese can't meet with an acrobatic volley.

A lot of players are struggling in terms of losing their footing on this pitch so far."
25',action,"Marcelo breaks to the left byline and clips a wonderful ball into the box! It sails over Ter Stegen, who was caught in no man's land, but Alba is there to head clear with Ronaldo and Vazquez lurking. Not the most confident of starts from the German goalkeeper.

23',action,"Benzema is picked out at the back post, but sees a volley well-blocked, before a second delivery from the left by Marcelo is inaccurate due to the Brazilian slipping over.

18',action,"Messi manages to earn a free-kick from Modric on the edge of the penalty area, which the Argentine gets up to take himself.

16',action,"Ronaldo is found in the penalty area by a delivery in from the right, but the Portuguese forward can only flick a glancing effort straight down Ter Stegen's throat. Barcelona respond with an attack down the left-hand side, but Neymar slips over - for the second time this afternoon. He might need to change his boots."
15',action,"Benzema goes down under pressure from Pique, but the referee waves play on. Modric, as a result, dives into a very late tackle on Messi. He touches the ball, but clatters through the Argentine's ankle. The official chooses to keep his cards in his pocket.

The away side win a corner, which sees Kovacic shoot from the edge of the box, but Mascherano directs the ball away from danger."
9',action,"Barcelona are dominating possession, but the hosts aren't playing the ball across the pitch quickly enough to really stretch Real Madrid.

Isco is scuttling around, trying to close space in between the lines, with Zidane's men pressing as a team to try and force the hosts into non-threatening areas of the pitch."
3',action,"No penalty! Lucas Vazquez is fed into the box and scampers forward, with Mascherano coming across to muscle the ex-Espanyol man off the ball. The Spaniard tumbles to the turf and asks for a spot-kick, but the referee isn't interested. Nervy moments for the Argentine centre-back already today!"
