,action,"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted a brace and Marco Reus provided three assists as Thomas Tuchel's side extend their Bundesliga home unbeaten run to 28 matches, coming from behind at the Signal Iduna Park to add to Gladbach's misery."
90',action,FULL-TIME: DORTMUND 4-1 GLADBACH.
89',substitution,"; Dortmund make their final change here, with Emre Mor replacing Dembele."
88',action,"INCREDIBLE RUNNING! Well nothing is surprising anymore coming from the feet of Pulisic at this point! The teenager has had an exquisite first half of the season and he's at it again here, weaving his way through the entirety of the Gladbach defence before forcing Sommer into a smart save at the near post."
86',action,"STAT: Gladbach have taken one away point this term – only Darmstadt are worse off (0). They have won one of their last 16 on the road spanning multiple seasons (2-0 in Darmstadt in May 2016, otherwise D4, L11)."
84',action,"Gladbach will be left to ponder what could have been tonight, after taking the lead after just six minutes through Raffael. The early goal seemed to spark something inside of Dortmund, however, as it's been overwhelmingly one-way traffic since. The battle between the two managers has clearly been won by Tuchel."
82',substitution,; Gladbach make their final change as Andre Hahn replaces Raffael.
80',action,"Dortmund are knocking it around assuredly as we enter the final 10 minutes. Gladbach have given up the fight as the three-goal hole proves too insurmountable in such a daunting venue. Reality has set in here for the visitors, whose traveling fans have become incredibly quiet."
78',substitution,; For Gladbach it's Fabian Johnson who comes on for Hazard.
78',substitution,"; A pair of USA internationals come into the match here for the two sides. Christian Pulisic enters for Gladbach, replacing Reus."
77',action,"STAT: Marco Reus (97 Bundesliga appearances + 36 goals for Gladbach) has had a hand in nine goals (4 goals, 5 assists) in seven top-flight games against his former club since joining Dortmund in summer 2012 (including today)."
75',action,"The tempo has fizzled out a bit with the match essentially out of reach now. Gladbach have to peel themselves off the ground and piece themselves back together in a hurry, as they travel to Barcelona in the Champions League on Tuesday. Dortmund play Wednesday away to Real Madrid."
73',substitution,"; A really interesting change here from Gladbach, who wait until they're 4-1 down to bring on an extra centre-half? Jannik Vestergaard enters the fray, making it a five-man back line, replacing Dahoud."
70',action,"It's become a matter of not if, but how many, for Dortmund, who have put in one of their best showings of the season when they needed it most, relieving the pressure that was rumoured to have been mounting on Thomas Tuchel."
68',assist,Assist Marco Reus ; Reus picks up his third assist of the afternoon - this one his best of the lot.
68',goal,"Goal Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ; ABSOLUTELY STUNNING! Dortmund running riot now! Reus makes a delightfully probing run through into the area to draw to him the attention of the defence, before serving it up on a platter for Aubameyang with a wonderfully improvised back-heel, teeing up the striker from close range for his second of the afternoon!"
66',action,"STAT: Gladbach are on a seven-game winless run for the first time under Andre Schubert (D3, L4). This is their longest wait for a victory in the top-flight since a nine-match streak under Lucien Favre (December 2013-March 2014)."
64',assist,Assist Marco Reus ; Reus picks up his second assist of the afternoon.
64',goal,"Goal Ousmane Dembélé ; EXQUISITE STRIKE AND DORTMUND DOUBLE THEIR LEAD! Dembele continues to impress this season and the teenager has his third league goal of the campaign here, this one perhaps the best of the bunch! He takes a pass from Reus before twisting and turning atop the area to open up space for a shot, and then drills one low into the bottom corner!"
63',action,"NOT QUITE! A bit of pinball on the break, albeit controlled pinball, as Reus and Aubameyang somehow combine to play the striker through into the area. He has a bit of difficulty controlling the bouncing ball, however, and Strobl in able to break it up with a wonderful recovery challenge!"
62',action,"SUPERB COVER! Elvedi denied Reus a clean shot at goal in the first half, and now it's Christensen who does his part, sliding in from behind with a perfectly timed challenge - and it had to be - to deny Reus from in close after it appeared as though the forward was through on goal!"
60',action,There's a terrific noise around the ground as the fast-paced tempo continues in this match. It's been a terrific watch through the first hour of the match and remains wonderfully poised for the final 30 minutes.
58',action,"STAT: Dortmund have lost just one home game against Gladbach in the last 18 years (2-1 in March 2014, otherwise W12, D2)."
56',action,"SOMMER SAVES! Big shouts at one end as Hazard goes down on the edge of the box, which Sokratis takes exception to as he thinks it was a dive, and the referee would agree as he waves play on. Back the other way come Dortmund and Aubameyang produces a clean strike to sting the palms of Sommer."
54',action,"INCHES WIDE! So nearly an own goal for Sokratis who comes sliding a bit recklessly into the area to get on the end of Raffael's cross, but there was no real need for him to intervene as there was no one poised to get on the end of it! But what a horrific back pass that was from Reus to gift Gladbach the chance."
52',action,"Gladbach have plenty of firepower in attack so that's not their issue, it's just the whole shape of the team that's hurt them this afternoon. There's no outlet when they win the ball back and, because of it, they've spent far too much time hemmed in defence. These midfielders and wide men need to do a better job of making themselves available."
50',action,"IT WON'T COUNT! Dortmund off in celebration as Reus gets on the end of Piszczek's cross and sends an exceptional back-heel finish in at the far post, but the offside flag is raised! He tried to reset himself but just failed to do so. What a return to the XI that would have been for Marco Reus."
48',action,"Another strong start to a half from Dortmund, who are comfortably keeping the bulk of possession as they park themselves in the attacking half. Schubert has to be pondering some changes. He likely sent the same team out on a short leash, with some ideas for substitutions in mind should it not get any better for them inside the first 10-15 minutes."
46',action,Here we go again...
,action,"Raffael gave Gladbach an early lead, but Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Lukasz Piszczek saw Dortmund produce an immediate response, coming from behind to take the lead all inside 15 minutes, and that's where we stand at the end of a wonderfully entertaining first half at the Signal Iduna Park."
45',action,HALF-TIME: DORTMUND 2-1 GLADBACH.
44',action,"HANDBALL! Unlucky for Stindl as the ball ricochets off his shin and onto his hand, forcing the referee into awarding Dortmund a free-kick. Wendt was through on the left had Stindl been able to properly control first time there!"
42',action,"The tempo has fizzled out a bit as we enter the final few minutes of this first half. For all Dortmund's dominance, their back line has shown one or two vulnerabilities, allowing those secondary runs from the Gladbach players to get to the endline. It's certainly going to be something to keep an eye on moving forward."
40',action,STAT: BVB have picked up 19 more points from their 23 home league games under Tuchel (59) than their 23 on the road (40). He is the third boss not to lose any of his opening 23 home games in charge of a Bundesliga side (also Ernst Happel and Georg Keßler).
38',action,"Gladbach are getting more involved as half-time approaches. This is much more like it from the visitors, able to string some passes together here and keep the ball in the attacking half, as they up their pursuit of an equaliser before the interval."
36',substitution,; Nuri Sahin's injury woes continue as he can't make it through the first half here and has to be replaced by Julian Weigl.
36',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Łukasz Piszczek ; Good work from Wendt, who has been a bright spot in this first half for Gladbach. The full-back does well here to get goalside of Piszczek, who drags him to ground from behind to concede a free-kick in a dangerous area and pick up a yellow card."
34',action,"OVER! Kramer can't mark his man as Ginter eludes his watch to get on the end of a corner, but his headed effort drifts just over the bar!"
33',action,"CRUCIAL BLOCK! Stunning bit of defensive work from Elvedi! The centre-half covers a lot of ground as he comes across and slides in with a last-ditch challenge to block Reus' effort, when it looked as though the forward had a clear sight at goal following a perfectly weighted throughball from Dembele!"
31',action,"This is a better spell from Gladbach as they spend a brief stint in possession, providing some respite for their back line. Christensen slips, however, but as Aubameyang appears to be gifted passage through on goal, the referee blows play dead for a foul - and it was the right decision."
29',action,STAT: Dortmund did the double over Gladbach last term for the first time since 2009/10. Their 4-0 victory on matchday one was Tuchel’s first league game in charge of BVB.
27',action,"Andre Schubert has got his tactics all wrong in this first half. They're being outclassed all over the pitch by Dortmund, unable to get bodies around the ball. They need to make some adjustments mid-half here, or it could get away from them before it's too late."
25',action,"Gladbach continue to drop deeper and deeper in defence, setting a dangerous precedent for themselves here. Dortmund are being afforded all the time they need to really impose themselves in possession, and are inching closer to a third, which Gladbach simply cannot afford."
23',action,"LIGHTNING BREAK! When Dortmund counter with pace, it's a real sight for sore eyes. Aubameyang leads the latest charge, surging forward before finding Bartra on the edge of the box. The centre-half dinks in a cross towards the far post for Reus, but the forward can't direct an awkward half-volley on target."
21',action,Gladbach are coming off a bit shell-shocked here. They need to get the feet back under them and start putting up a better fight. It's all been a bit too comfortable for Dortmund thus far when in possession. The visitors have to change that.
19',action,"STAT: Dortmund are unbeaten in 27 Bundesliga home games (W22, D5) – an ongoing club record. Bayern were the last visitors to leave the city with all three points (April 2015)."
17',action,"A fiery opening to the match in Dortmund has been a joy to behold, with three goals already finding the back of the net. It's a deserved lead, it has to be said, for Dortmund, who have come flying out of the gate, looking wonderfully sharp in possession, adopting an excellent tempo in their approach."
15',assist,Assist Marc Bartra Aregall ; Clever flick from Bartra to serve that one up on a platter for Piszczek.
15',goal,"Goal Łukasz Piszczek ; FROM BEHIND, DORTMUND LEAD! Piszczek winds up getting the final touch, heading home from close range after getting on the end of Bartra's cleverly improvised flick, following a tidy delivery in from the right. What an unbelievable response this has been from Dortmund to falling behind early!"
14',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Tobias Strobl ; It is yellow. The referee gets over and produces the card for Strobl, who will be walking a very fine line now the rest of the way."
13',action,"The referee has a decision to make here! That's brutally late and cynical from Strobl who knew he had no chance of keeping pace with Aubameyang on the right, thus sliding into the back of the striker to take him to ground and prevent a very dangerous break. It should be yellow, anything more would be harsh."
11',action,"What an absolutely incredible start this has been from a neutral standpoint. End-to-end action at the Signal Iduna Park, with both teams already finding the back of the net in impressive fashion. Sommer really should have done better to keep out Aubameyang's effort, however, letting it dip under him rather embarrassingly at the near post."
9',action,STAT: Aubameyang has been directly involved in each of Dortmund’s last eight league goals (7 goals + 1 assist).
7',goal,"Goal Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ; IMMEDIATE RESPONSE! Dembele glides forward in attack and picks out Reus, who tees it up for Aubameyang, and Europe's leading scorer hammers a finish in at the near post! Questions will be asked of Sommer there, but this is an incredible response from the hosts!"
7',assist,"Assist Marco Reus ; Reus produced the touch to set Aubameyang up, and is credited with the assist."
6',goal,"Goal Raffael Caetano de Araújo ; GLADBACH SNATCH THE OPENER! Stunning stuff from the visitors in attack! Dahoud springs Wendt down the left, and his cross isn't dealt with, headed straight into the path of Raffael who produces an excellent finish from the edge of the box!"
5',action,"COULD HAVE BEEN COSTLY! Self-inflicted errors simply cannot be tolerated in a match of this pedigree, but Gladbach nearly gift Dortmund the opener inside of five minutes! Wendt gives the ball away to Aubameyang, who is able to round the keeper and lash a delivery across the face of goal from a tight angle, but Reus can't get goalside of Elvedi to knock it in."
3',action,"Dortmund have started confidently, working the ball around admirably in the attacking half, keen to force the issue and push the tempo in attack. It promises to be an open, fast-paced match at the Signal Iduna, and the opening few minutes seems to reinforce that."
1',action,"AND WE'RE OFF! The battle of the Borussia's is underway as Dortmund get us started, attacking left to right, in their classic yellow and black stripes, with Gladbach in white."
,action,"Andre Schubert makes just one change to the visitors, with Julian Korb coming in to play right-back. Nico Elvedi shifts over to his natural position at centre-half as a result, which sees Janik Vestergaard move to the bench to make room."
,action,"Marc Bartra comes into defence this afternoon, pushing Matthias Ginter into midfield and Julian Weigl to the bench. Nuri Sahin comes in at the expense of Mario Gotze, while Ousmane Dembele and Marco Reus are brought in to flank Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, with Adrian Ramos and Andre Schurrle dropped from the XI."
