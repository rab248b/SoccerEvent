,action,"Thanks for joining our commentary this evening. Until next time, goodbye."

,action,"Both sides earn a share of the spoils this evening at the Etihad Stadium, but Manchester City will feel hard done by as Raheem Sterling was denied a penalty mere seconds before Tottenham scored their equaliser."
,action,FULL-TIME: MANCHESTER CITY 2-2 TOTTENHAM
90'+4',action,The referee ends the contest.
90'+4',action,"Walker hits the deck with cramp, so we may have a little bit extra of time added on here."
90'+4',action,"Zabaleta makes a crucial hold on Rose to stop him breaking past the full-back on a counter. The England man responds by giving him a shove after the fact, handing the hosts a free-kick."
90'+3',action,"The crowd are urging City forward, but there's a lack of urgency from Guardiola's men."
90'+1',action,Wanyama makes an excellent block at the back for the visitors at the near post after De Bruyne's looked like finding Delph.
90',substitution,; Delph replaces Silva in the dying stages.
90',action,There will be four minutes of added time. Will either of these sides be able to force a winner?
88',action,"Son raids down the left flank for the visitors and has space to operate in, but Sane gets back well to cover ground and quell the opening for Spurs."

84',substitution,; Stones replaces Clichy for the home side.
84',action,OFFSIDE! Jesus is denied a dream start to his City career by the offside flag as he turns the ball home at the back post from De Bruyne's cross. Guardiola throws himself to the ground in frustration.
83',action,"CHANCE! Jesus almost makes an impact straight off the bench as he fires a low ball across the face of goal, but no-one can connect. De Bruyne gathers on the opposite flank and lifts the ball into the box for the Brazilian to attack, but he guides his effort over the bar."
82',substitution,; Jesus arrives for his City debut to replace Sterling.
81',action,"Slight hesitation from Bravo as he opts to come for the ball with Eriksen advancing. However, the ball skips off the pitch and lands safely in his grasp."

78',substitution,; Sissoko replaces Dembele for the visitors.
77',assist,Assist Harry Kane ; Kane slides the ball to Son in the box and the winger does the rest with a fine strike.
77',goal,"Goal Heung-Min Son ; GOAL!!!!!!! SPURS ARE LEVEL! Controversy at the Etihad Stadium as seconds after City are denied a penalty Tottenham go up the pitch and notch their equaliser. Kane finds Son in space in the box and the winger picks his spot, placing his strike into the bottom corner. A fine finish."
76',action,"PENALTY SHOUT! De Bruyne releases Sterling through the middle and he has time to put his effort past Lloris. However, Walker gives him a shove at the last second to put him off his strike as he fires straight at the Spurs keeper. That should have been a spot-kick and a red card."
74',action,"De Bruyne charges down Rose's clearance and races into the box. However, the Belgian is unable to pick out a team-mate and Spurs can breathe again."
73',action,"Spurs spread the ball from right to left as Winks finds Rose on the flank. The full-back has time to take the ball down and he attempts to fire it across the face of goal, only to scuff his effort out for a goal-kick."
71',action,Eriksen has not had one of his better games as he plays a potential throughball to Kane straight into the path of Kolarov.
68',action,"City work the ball well across the pitch to De Bruyne on the right flank. He has options to hit in the middle, but Wanyama clears his cross away at the near post."

65',substitution,; Winks gets the nod over Davies to replace Alderweireld - who has a hamstring injury. Wanyama drops back into the defence alongside Dier.
64',action,A worry for Spurs as Alderweireld is forced off with an injury. That will force a re-shuffle as Wimmer has already come off the pitch.
63',action,It's all go at the moment in the Etihad Stadium. End-to-end football and surely there are more goals left in this contest.
62',action,"PENALTY SHOUT! De Bruyne threads the ball through to Sterling in the box and he tries to break free of Rose and goes down in a heap with his international team-mate. He wants a penalty, but replays show that the defender made an excellent covering tackle."
60',action,"OFFSIDE! Alderweireld sends Son over the top and he takes the ball in stride, but the offside flag goes up against the winger. Zabaleta just moved up in time."
58',goal,"Goal Bamidele Alli ; GOAL!!!!!! ALLI NODS HOME! Spurs are back in the game as Walker latches on to a loose ball down the right and sends a peach of a cross into the box. Kolarov tries to clear at the near post, but cannot get enough on his header and Alli pounces at the back stick, heading into the net."
56',action,"Spurs raid down the left and Rose fires a low ball into the box, but Kolarov is there at the near post to clear ahead of Kane."
54',goal,"Goal Kevin De Bruyne ; GOALL!!!!! DE BRUYNE FINDS THE NET! City double their lead as Lloris makes another horrendous mistake, this time dropping Sterling's cross right at the feet of the Belgian, who accepts the gift and taps home from close range. A nightmare for the Spurs skipper."

49',goal,"Goal Leroy Sané ; GOALL!!!!!! SANE PUTS CITY AHEAD! De Bruyne sends a delightful ball over the top and Sane is unmarked as he surges towards the box. Lloris attempts to clear with his head, but fails to make sufficient contact and it allows the German to seize possession and slot into the empty net."
48',action,"Better start to the half from the visitors as they've displayed a more attacking intent, starting with Walker down the right"
46',substitution,; Wimmer struggled in the first half and has been replaced by Son at the break.
46',action,We're back underway at the Etihad Stadium.
,action,The players are back out for the second half.
,action,Tottenham have been below-par and have barely threatened the City goal. That may prompt Mauricio Pochettino into changes at the break.
,action,"It's all square the break, but Manchester City will wonder how they are not ahead in the contest. Pep Guardiola's men have dominated the match and have come close to opening the scoring on several occasions, but have not managed to breach Hugo Lloris' goal."

40',action,"CHANCES! Otamendi manages to get behind the Spurs backline and sees his deflected effort loop towards the target and bounce on the top of the net. From the resulting corner Sterling lines up a strike, but Lloris punches the ball away."

35',action,"Aguero raids into space down the left and has Sterling making a break inside the box, but his cross is gathered by Lloris."
34',action,"CHANCE! City catch Spurs on the break and with only two players back, but De Bruyne wastes the initial opening. The home side keep the attack alive and Silva sends the ball to the back post for Sane to head at goal, but he can only send his effort wide."

32',action,"Dembele sends Rose down the left flank with a neat pass, but a clearing tackle from Otamendi takes the ball away from Alli."

24',action,"Tottenham earn their first chance to threaten, but Eriksen opts to play the ball short from a corner to Dembele. The Belgian goes for the strike, but Sane makes the block and attempts to counter."
22',action,A heart-stopping moment for City fans as Bravo is forced to race off his line to gather ahead of Eriksen. The Chilean just reels the ball into his grasp just inside the line.
21',action,"WIDE! De Bruyne tees up Zabaleta for a strike on the edge of the box from the corner. He meets the ball on the half-volley with his left foot and his effort appears to be heading towards the bottom corner, only to spin away from the target at the last second."

15',action,City are turning the screw in the early stages and Tottenham are fortunate to clear their lines from another set-piece after Silva was fouled by Alli.

10',action,"Eriksen and Walker attempt to link up down the right, but the full-back just goes too early for the Dane's pass and is flagged offside."
