,action,"That's all from this one, where Barcelona were 6-0 winners and temporarily go back to the top of LaLiga. Goodbye!"
,action,"For Alaves, who will play Barca in the Copa del Rey final, this was a frustrating game. They were in the contest until the opener, and a rush of goals followed a few sloppy mistakes."
,action,"There will, though, be concerns about that injury for Vidal. It didn't look great, and the player was clearly in some discomfort."
,action,"A straight-forward win for Barca in the end, scoring through Suarez, twice, Neymar, Messi, an Alexis own goal and Rakitic."
90'+4',action,FULL-TIME: Alaves 0-6 Barcelona.
90'+3',yellow-card,Yellow Card Víctor Laguardia Cisneros ; Laguardia dives in on Digne and goes into the book.
90',action,"There are three minutes to be added here, but the contest has been over for some time."
90',action,"CHANCE! An opportunity for a consolation, but Santos drags wide from inside the area for Alaves."
87',substitution,"; Hernandez has been the star for Alaves, but he was involved in that incident with Vidal, and is replaced by Raul Garcia."
87',action,"Vidal has disappeared down the tunnel on a stretcher. Barca, having used all of their substitutes, are down to 10 men."
85',action,"OUCH! Vidal looks in real pain over in the corner! He slides in, but comes out worse, and his ankle appears to be at an awkward angle as physios rush on. They're immediately calling for a stretcher."
83',action,CLOSE! Suarez fancies a hat-trick! He goes for a delicate chip from outside the area and just misses over the top.
81',action,"Llorente has endured a frustrating 80 minutes. He's shown flashes, but often been disappointed by refereeing decisions. He is again, now, as the ball is taken off his toe."
79',action,"Still, Alaves come forward. Barca are pushed all the way back, but Ter Stegen's fine footwork gets him out of trouble. The hosts need to be careful not to leave further gaps at the back."
77',action,"SAVE! Hernandez has been the star for Alaves today. He twists and turns on the left, shooting hard and low towards the near post. Ter Stegen blocks behind, and the corner is cleared."
75',action,"There's a stoppage at the moment as Suarez receives treatment, having collided with Torres. Both players look to be alright."
74',action,"Are Barca happy with their tally? The game has slowed now. Suarez does try to launch an attack, but Neymar is caught offside."
72',action,"A rare Alaves attack and Hernandez does brilliantly to keep the ball on by the left-hand corner flag. He has space to deliver, but the ball curls behind."
72',substitution,"; Andre Gomes comes off, now, and Sergi Roberto is on."
71',action,"CLOSE! Messi curls over the wall, but his free-kick does not quite come down and strikes the top of the net."
70',action,"Four goals in less than 10 minutes. The Alaves side that looked so solid and resolute for long stretches of the first half are long gone. Barca have the freedom of the park, and have now won a free-kick around 25 yards from goal."
67',goal,"Goal Luis Alberto Suárez Díaz ; GOAL! Barca are rampant! Suarez plays a lovely pass onto Neymar's toe, and, although Pacheco saves the low shot, the ball loops up for Suarez to volley in. 0-6."
66',substitution,"; Umtiti was limping at half-time, and the scoreline allows him to be rested. Jordi Alba is on."
65',assist,"Assist Luis Alberto Suárez Díaz ; After receiving the ball back from Messi, Suarez's unintentional backheel teed up Rakitic."
65',goal,"Goal Ivan Rakitić ; GOAL! Rakitic gets in on the act! Barca attack at speed, through Suarez and Messi, and Rakitic rams a stunning strike into the far top corner. This is becoming embarrassing for Alaves. 0-5."
65',action,SAVE! Alaves are still going and Ter Stegen has to be at his best to parry a firm strike.
64',substitution,; Andres Iniesta makes his entrance for the booked Busquets.
63',own-goal,"Own Goal Alexis Ruano Delgado ; GOAL! This is so unfortunate for Alaves. Suarez plays in Messi, Hernandez recovers, but plays his tackle into the retreating Alexis, with the ball rolling into the net. 0-4."
61',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ivan Rakitić ; Rakitic goes into the book, too, as he dives in on Hernandez. The free-kick, though, comes to nothing."
59',goal,"Goal Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini ; GOAL! Messi has his goal and it's game over! Vigaray's touch is loose, Messi pounces and rams a finish through Pacheco. Disappointing for both the defender and the goalkeeper. 0-3."
59',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Sergio Busquets i Burgos ; Busquets is booked for taking a free-kick too early, rather bizarrely."
57',substitution,; And that's Katai's last action. On comes Oscar Romero.
56',action,"CHALLENGE! Crucial block from Digne! Santos frees Femenia, who squares to Katai, but the recovering defender stops the shot."
55',action,"Not quite from Messi! Alaves push high and think they have Barca penned in, before Busquets shifts the ball on to Messi. His pass, though, is early and too close to the defender as Suarez runs in behind."
54',action,"And now Alaves win a corner! Sobrino and Hernandez are a threat on the left, but it's Katai across there to force a challenge from Vidal. Santos and Laguardia both fail to send the ball goalwards, though."
53',action,"Barca win consecutive corners. The first, poor again by Neymar, is bundled clear for Vidal to thump a deflected strike over. Taking the second short, Rakitic sends a cross way over the box and behind."
51',action,"Now Vigaray nudges Suarez out of it, leaving the Barca man unhappy, but Alaves' attack doesn't get very far anyway. Barca have the ball back."
50',action,"Llorente faded after a bright start, and he's not happy as Neymar shoulder-barges him off the ball. No foul and Barca have possession."
49',action,"Laguardia was impressive in the first half, despite Barca's two goals, and he makes a solid start to the second period with a challenge on Suarez. The Uruguay international gets his head on the subsequent corner, but misses the target."
47',action,"CHANCE! And what a chance! Hernandez, now playing in a wing-back role, gets in on the left and delivers for Santos. Somehow, from the centre of goal, the forward fires over."
46',substitution,"; Nenad Krsticic was not in the game at all in the first half, and a change of formation sees Kiko Femenia come on."
46',action,KICK-OFF: Santos gets us back under way!
,action,The players are making their way back out onto the pitch at Mendizorroza...
,action,"Suarez grabbed the first goal, turning a low cross into the bottom corner, and he was then involved as Pacheco fumbled and Neymar swept in. Barca surely won't be caught now."
,action,"For the first half an hour, Alaves had matched Barca, defending well and having perhaps the best opportunity through Hernandez. It all went wrong for the home side in the final 10 minutes of the half, though."
45',action,HALF-TIME: Alaves 0-2 Barcelona.
45',action,"Frustration is growing for the hosts now. Llorente thinks he's got the better of Messi, but the referee awards a foul. Barca are dominant."
43',action,"Alaves need to be careful here. Obviously disappointed by the two quickfire goals, they are now pushing players forward as they seek a route back into the game. Neymar counters and looks to catch the home side out, but his pass doesn't reach Messi."
40',assist,"Assist Luis Alberto Suárez Díaz ; Suarez was blocked off by Pacheco, but the ball fell kindly for his fellow Barca forward."
40',goal,"Goal Neymar da Silva Santos Junior ; GOAL! Oh dear, Pacheco. Neymar makes it two! The goalkeeper fails to deal with the ball at his near post and it pops up for the Brazil international to slam into the net. 0-2."
37',assist,Assist Aleix Vidal Parreu ; It was Vidal who was open on the right and delivered low for Suarez to score.
37',goal,Goal Luis Alberto Suárez Díaz ; GOAL! Barca lead through Suarez! He gets free in the middle for the first time and rams a finish inside the near post. 0-1.
36',action,"Alaves' quicker players are keen for a counter at every opportunity. Sobrino tries to outrun Umtiti on the left, but cannot get over the halfway line before tangling with the defender."
35',action,"Once again, Neymar's corner is awful. Cleared at the near post, Barca need the winger to be much better than that."
35',action,"Corner! Vidal dashes forward on the right and lays off for Rakitic. A low cross-shot is blocked, but picks up pace and runs behind."
34',action,"Neymar is again on the move. He slips a pass inside, but Andre Gomes leaves it for Suarez, who had expected the Portugal international to take a touch. A miscommunication, and Alaves have the ball back."
32',action,"Suarez battles through on the left and Neymar's pass allows Andre Gomes to switch to Messi on the opposite side. A first time cross is into the danger zone, but Victor Laguardia, a rock so far, nods clear."
30',action,"There's really no way through for Barca when Alaves have numbers back. Vidal comes forward but runs out of options, Rakitic crosses, and Busquets finally shoots, but it's scuffed and blocked."
28',action,"It's Alaves who are playing the swift one-touch passing at the moment. Another attack ends with a cross from the left, but Umtiti chests down the centre and Ter Stegen clings on."
25',action,"SAVE AGAIN! And now Barca break! Andre Gomes is in on the left, opts against passing to a team-mate, and shoots at Pacheco. A good save, but a let-off for Alaves."
25',action,"AT THE OTHER END! Superb from Ter Stegen! What a chance! Suarez forces a corner, but another poor delivery allows Alaves to break. Theo Hernandez tears past Digne and he's in, but the goalkeeper blocks the finish brilliantly."
23',action,"SAVE! It's all going on in the middle! Sergio Busquets is being hassled, but, while fouled, pushes the ball forward. Andre Gomes lays off for Messi, who finds his shot blocked but creeping through for Suarez. Pacheco is quickly out, blocking with his defenders, and Suarez is bullied off the ball when Messi loops another cross in. Frantic."
22',action,"Neymar wins a corner on the left, but, again, his set-piece is poor and cleared."
21',action,"After an energetic start, Alaves appear happy to sit back and allow Barca to have the ball, perhaps waiting for a counter. They're still working hard, though, closing the player in possession."
19',action,"Llorente shows a lovely change of direction in the middle of midfield and frees Torres. The midfielder in turn looks to play a pass in behind the Barca defence, but it runs through for Ter Stegen."
18',action,"Digne wins a free-kick wide on the left, near the corner flag, and Neymar delivers. His cross is too low, though, and cleared, with further attempts to get a shot off coming to nothing."
17',action,"Having apparently shaken off that knock almost immediately, Neymar is back involved in the play again. His pass cannot find its target, but Rakitic does, eventually, cross from the right. The delivery, however, is far too deep."
16',action,"A worry for Barca! Neymar looked to be in on the left, but, as he checked back, appeared to twist his ankle. Alaves clear and Neymar is left clutching his leg."
15',action,"CHANCE! Barca finally enjoy some time on the ball. Mathieu lofts a cross towards Rakitic, and, while a defender nods away, Vidal pounces and controls on his chest before firing over the top from inside the area."
13',action,"Messi has taken up a central position behind Suarez, with Neymar out to the left, but none of Barca's front three can find space in the early stages. Lucas Digne's pass towards Neymar runs behind."
11',action,"Vidal's slack pass is cut out by Daniel Torres, and Alaves move forward through a number of neat one-twos. Aleksandar Katai and Christian Santos are both involved, but Mathieu is on hand to win the ball back for Barca."
9',action,"The set-piece is cleared, but back come Barca. Messi lays off for Rakitic, but his return, a lofted ball, is nodded clear. Neymar blasts a shot straight at an advancing defender."
9',action,"Corner to Barca! Neymar gets in on the left and tries to pick out Suarez in the middle. The delivery, though, does not reach the Uruguay international and is turned behind."
8',action,"Suarez makes his frustration known as he tries to play Rakitic in behind on the right, but the former Sevilla man did not follow the pass and the ball runs behind for Alaves."
6',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Samuel Umtiti ; A yellow for Samuel Umtiti. Vidal's block almost pays Neymar in, but the winger loses the ball and Ruben Sobrino attacks on the left. Pushing the ball past Umtiti, he's fouled."
5',action,"And now Ter Stegen watches Marcos Llorente shoot from distance, firing high and wide after cutting in from the left."
4',action,"SAVE! Lionel Messi gets his first sight of goal! An extended one-two with Neymar saw the Argentina international breaking into the box on the left, and his low, hard shot was smothered by Fernando Pacheco."
3',action,"A first Barca foray, and Ivan Rakitic takes the ball from Aleix Vidal on the right, crossing towards the back post. Suarez, though, the only man in the middle, is kept away from the delivery and Alaves clear."
2',action,"As you would expect, Barcelona are already looking to keep the ball and pass through the midfield, but, in the opening minute, Alaves have put the visitors under pressure. Marc-Andre ter Stegen escaped as he took his time to clear, and a home attack ended with Jeremy Mathieu clearing a low cross."
1',action,KICK-OFF: Luis Suarez gets us started!
,action,"The players are out on the pitch, and kick-off is just moments away!"
,action,"However, the visitors are winless and goalless in their last three Liga trips to Mendizorroza, and Alaves won the sides' meeting at Camp Nou in September. Don't rule the home side out..."
,action,"Barca have a big Champions League game against Paris Saint-Germain to come on Tuesday, but, trailing Real Madrid by a point having played two games more, Luis Enrique's side cannot afford to take their eyes off the ball in the league."
,action,"Subs: Cillessen, Denis Suarez, Iniesta, Paco Alcacer, Alba, Roberto, Alena."
,action,"Barcelona: Ter Stegen, Vidal, Umtiti, Mathieu, Digne, Rakitic, Busquets, Andre Gomes, Messi, Suarez, Neymar."
,action,"Subs: Ortola, Garcia, Camarasa, Romero, Manu Garcia, Deyverson, Kiko Femenia."
