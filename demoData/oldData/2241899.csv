The ball bounces back to him, however, and he then quickly sets up Bellerin, but the full-back's cross is just as poor and sails harmlessly out of play for a goal-kick."
31',action,"Arsenal push plenty of bodies forward from the restart as they desperately try to quickly get back into the game, but Stoke have enough bodies back to deal with the pressure being put on them deep down the right flank."
29',penalty-goal,"Penalty Goal Charlie Adam ; GOAL! Charlie Adam, who had to wait for quite a while whilst Allen received medical treatment, steps up and calmly beats Cech with a brilliant strike that buries into the bottom right-hand corner of the net."

23',action,"What an opportunity for Joe Allen! A wonderful lofted pass flies into the left-hand side of the Arsenal penalty area and finds Arnautovic. He brings the ball down beautifully before spinning and finding Allen, but he ends up firing his first-time strike a few yards wide of the far post. He really should have buried that!"
22',action,"Imbula is caught sleeping on the ball just outside of the Stoke penalty area, allowing Sanchez to steal the ball from under his nose. The Chilean then tries to skip into the box, but the Stoke midfielder does well to atone for his error with a tackle at the vital moment."
21',action,"Vital interception by Pieters! After dealing with the danger, Arsenal try to hit Stoke on a blisteringly quick counter-attack that ends with Gabriel over on the right wing, but the defender is unable to skip past Pieters and loses out to a wonderful tackle from the Dutchman."
20',action,"Shaqiri and Mame Biram Diouf link up well deep down the right wing before the latter fires a low cross into the Arsenal penalty area and towards Arnautovic, but Koscielny is easily able to stick out a foot to stop the ball from finding the Austrian."
18',action,"It's been a good start to the game from both sides, but Arsenal currently find themselves on the front foot as they continue to push forward. They're doing well to put Stoke's back line under plenty of pressure, with Walcott and Oxlade-Chamberlain looking particularly dangerous."

9',action,"Nervy moments for Lee Grant! A pass is played back to the Stoke goalkeeper, who takes his time with his clearance. Sanchez flies towards the shot-stopper and makes sure he puts him under plenty of pressure, giving Grant a few things to think about before his clearance eventually deflects out for a goal-kick."
7',action,"After doing well to deal with the danger, Stoke break forward on a swift counter-attack of their own. Giannelli Imbula bursts down the right flank on a great run before teeing up Arnautovic, who then picks out Shaqiri inside the box, but the latter is unable to get a shot away quickly and is eventually dispossessed."
6',action,"Chance for Alexis Sanchez! A poor pass from Charlie Adam is picked up by Sanchez, who immediately sprints forward. He breaks into the right-hand side of the Stoke penalty area before shooting, but the angle is too tight and he's unable to hit the target."

,action,"Sloppy defending was most to blame for their early season woes, but Stoke head to the Emirates searching for their third consecutive clean sheet, something that they haven’t achieved in the league for almost exactly a year. The last time they came to Arsenal’s home patch and left with anything was way back in 1981, but they certainly have a good chance to break that unwanted record this afternoon."
,action,"Stoke’s difficult start to the season now seems to be a distant memory, as they currently sit ninth in the table thanks to an impressive two month period. Only Bournemouth have beaten them since the start of October, with five of their previous seven clashes ending in victories to help them climb up the table and well away from the relegation zone that once housed them."
,action,"He wasn’t on the scoresheet in their 4-1 thumping of Basel on Tuesday, but Alexis Sanchez has been in magnificent form recently. The Chilean has thrived as his side's main striker, scoring seven goals in his last five league appearances, including a hat-trick at the London Stadium last weekend. As a result, he’s almost certain to play a big role in what should be a hard-fought contest between two in-form sides."
,action,"It continues to be a good season for Arsenal, who, thanks to a 13-game unbeaten streak, head into this afternoon’s clash in second place, just three points behind Chelsea. Draws against Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United were followed by comprehensive wins against Bournemouth and West Ham United, and they’ll be looking to do the same today as they try to keep the pressure firmly on the Premier League leaders."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Premier League game between Arsenal and Stoke City at the Emirates Stadium.
