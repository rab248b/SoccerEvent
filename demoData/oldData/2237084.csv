90'+1',action,CAVANI HITS THE BAR! A looping header by Cavani crashes against the crossbar and Matuidi who was hoping to convert the rebound is offside! So close for PSG! Was that the chance for PSG to equalise?
90',action,There will be a minimum of three added on here.
89',action,"Fantastic atmosphere here being created by the Guingamp supporters, they can sense victory here if they can just deny PSG for a few more minutes. As it stands Guingamp will move up to fourth in the Ligue 1 table, behind PSG in third."
86',action,"Despite all their possession in the last few minutes, PSG haven't created any chances at goal and Guingamp are remaining tight and compact which is frustrating the visitors."
83',action,"PSG are throwing everything at Guingamp now, they're currently camped inside the hosts half but at the moment they are managing to clear their lines."
80',goal,"Goal Edinson Roberto Cavani Gómez ; GOOOALLLL PSG! They have pulled a goal back! Cavani with the finish from close range, which is his 17th Ligue 1 goal of the season. It was a terrific ball into his path by Kurzawa and the striker finished well. This will set up an interesting final few minutes!"

75',action,The packed out crowd here are loving this performance from their team and rightly so! Guingamp have taken their chances when PSG have faltered.
72',substitution,"; Third and final PSG substitution as Nkunku is replaced by the striker, Jean-Kévin Augustin."

70',goal,"Goal Nill De Pauw ; GOOOALLLL! IT'S 2-0! Nill De Pauw has doubled Guingamp's lead! What a performance this is from the hosts.

69',action,"PSG have struggled today and Guingamp have punished them! The hosts have been superb throughout, coping with everything that the champions could throw at them."

63',action,"Di Maria struggled to make an impact during this second half, despite a decent showing in the first-half.

62',substitution,; Another PSG substitution as Ángel di María  comes off to be replaced by Lucas Moura.

55',action,Verratti looks very lively and creative for PSG and Guingamp need to keep an eye on him and he uses his skill to create an opportunity.
53',action,"BEST CHANCE OF THE GAME! A terrific save by Johnsson to deny Cavani a goal! It was a great one-two between Cavani and Di Maria, with the latter seemingly putting it on a plate for the league's top goal scorer. However the Guingamp keeper makes himself big and blocks Cavani shot at goal from close range. That should've been a goal!"
51',action,"More urgency is needed here by PSG if they are to break the deadlock here. Guingamp are dealing with everything that the visitors are throwing at them right now, along with looking dangerous going forward themselves."
49',action,"Nkunku has ventured forward and beats a couple of Guingamp defenders on the edge of the box, just as he is about to fire at goal Kerbrat pulls off a terrific tackle to win the ball back."
48',action,"Lively start to the second half already, both teams wanting to venture forward but struggling to produce the final ball. Will the introduction of Krychowiak make a difference for PSG?"

45',action,That's the half-time whistle!
43',action,We've had just one attempt on target here so far and that came through Di Maria on 16 minutes. Surely plenty more to come here at the Stade du Roudourou.
41',action,"A horrible misskick by Marcal has handed PSG a corner out of nothing. Di Maria whips the ball in but it is firmly headed clear Guingamp have been very good defensively so far today, marking Cavani well and easily dealing with any crosses that come into the box."

26',action,ANOTHER GUINGAMP CHANCE! This time it is Briand who races through on goal after a misplaced pass by Thiago Sliva. However Marquinhos does well to get back and block his shot at goal. The resulting corner comes to nothing. We have a very end-to-end and exciting game on our hands here!
24',action,"The crowd are well behind their team now, Guingamp are playing the ball about well and are causing PSG problems at the back. The visitors have dropped off the pace slightly in the last few minutes."
21',action,"CHANCE GUINGAMP! The best attempt at goal by either team so far today, despite having a limited amount of possession. Coco pulls off some terrific skill to beat Layvin Kurzawa down the right wing, he then plays a ball into the cross which is superbly met by Moustapha Diallo but he can't keep his powerful shot down and it goes over the bar."
19',action,"Guingamp have only let in more than two goals in one match this season, so they may be hopeful of at least limiting the League’s leading goal scorer Edinson Cavani and the rest of PSG’s attack here."
16',action,PSG dominating possession and certainly looking the more dangerous side and the more likely to open the scoring. Di Maria has just popped up on the left flank and fired a low powerful shot at Karl-Johan Johnsson but the goalkeeper is alert and gathers the ball.
15',action,STAT: PSG have already lost more games this season in Ligue 1 then they did last season when they were crowned champions.
12',action,First Guingamp attack of the game! Good movement from the attackers with Marcus Coco doing well to whip a ball into the box down the left flank and is met by Jimmy Briand but the striker is crowded out by the PSG defenders and his shot goes wide of the goal.
10',action,"Guingamp are putting PSG under plenty of pressure high up the pitch here, restricting the visitors to possession in their own half and the middle of the pitch. However Marco Verratti is pulling all the strings in the midfield and he looks dangerous here today."
9',action,It's all PSG here at the moment. Di Maria tries his luck from the edge of the box but his curling left footed shot goes high and wide of the goal.
7',action,Angel Di Maria almost picks Edison Cavani out with a superb chipped ball over the backline. However Christophe Kerbrat does well to get his head to the ball and direct it back to his goalkeeper. It was vital header to make as Cavani would've been through on goal otherwise.
5',action,"Two corners in a row for PSG here, putting the hosts under pressure early on. However neither set piece is good enough and Guingamp easily clear their lines. Although PSG immediately win the ball back and enjoy a spell of possession early on."
4',action,"There is a fantastic atmosphere here in Guingamp with a packed out stadium making plenty of noise. As the hosts sit sixth in Ligue 1 they will be optimistic that they can get something out of the game. However PSG as always, will only be satisfied with all three points."

,action,Today's opponents Guingamp are a respectable sixth in the table and therefore are a team that PSG will need to perform well against to come away with the three points. The hosts suffered a 1-0 defeat against Rennes in their last Ligue 1 game and then beat Olympique Lyonnais on penalties in the Coupe de la Ligue in midweek.
,action,"The current champions recovered from two goals down to rescue a point against Nice last time out in Ligue 1, which prevented them from slipping seven points behind the leaders, which could've proven terminal for PSG ahead of the winter break. However two late goals from Edison Cavani spared PSG's blushes at the Parc des Princes."
,action,"PSG could do with picking up three points today if they are to stand a chance of catching Ligue 1 leaders Nice, having failed to do so over the last three games after losing to Montpellier and then drawing against Nice and Ludogorets."
