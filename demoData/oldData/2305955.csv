,action,That's all from us at the Stadio Renzo Barbera. Thanks for joining us throughout this Serie A clash between Palermo and Inter Milan.
,action,"Inter Milan make it six wins in a row in the league and overtake their city rivals in the table. It took the visitors a while to break down the hosts, but the goal eventually came from Joao Mario in the second half."
90'+5',yellow-red,Yellow/Red Alessandro Gazzi ; A disappointing end for Palermo as Gazzi collects his second yellow and a red card.
90'+3',action,It looks as if 10-man Inter are going to be collecting all three points. Ever since the red card Palermo haven't looked like scoring and the visitors are cruising to victory after the early drama.
90'+1',yellow-card,Yellow Card Robin Quaison ; Quaison collects a late yellow card for a foul on Kondogbia.
89',action,"A cross is headed behind by Santon which presents Palermo with a chance to get players forward, but Quaison's delivery goes all the way through the penalty area and Inter are allowed to counter-attack."
87',action,Palermo are struggling to string a number of passes together. A long ball forward to Nestorovski is headed down to nobody as the home side fail to trouble Handanovic.
85',action,"Right, it looks as if we may get some football again in the last five minutes, rather than the referee blowing his whistle every 20 seconds."
83',yellow-card,Yellow Card Alessandro Diamanti ; Diamanti gets a yellow card for the quick free-kick.
83',action,"DRAMA! More drama at the Barbera as a quick free-kick from Diamanti is played to Quaison and he manages to fire past Handanovic, but the referee wasn't happy with the set-piece and disallows the goal."
82',substitution,; Defensive sub for Inter as Santon comes on for Candreva.
81',substitution,; Chochev comes on for Jajalo as Palermo chuck men forward.
81',action,"This match looked a certain victory for Inter, but the red card may cause problems for the visitors in the last 10 minutes. Ansaldi has had a strong game up to this point, but the away side must finish it without him."
79',yellow-red,"Yellow/Red Cristian Daniel Ansaldi ; RED CARD! Ansaldi collects a second yellow card and then a red for a 50/50 challenge but the referee views it differently. Pioli protests the decision, but he is also sent to the stands. Drama at the Renzo Barbera."
79',action,"A corner from Palermo is pushed away from Handanovic which launches a counter-attack for the away side, but Balogh brings a close to the attack by following Joao Mario in the midfield."
78',yellow-card,Yellow Card Norbert Balogh ; Balogh collects a yellow card for a foul on Joao Mario.
78',substitution,; Attacking sub for Palermo as Rispoli comes off for Diamanti.
77',substitution,; Defensive sub for Inter as Kondogbia comes on for Perisic.
77',action,Inter are starting to move into a defensive shape as this match advances with players starting to sit deeper and it appears as if they're moving into a 4-4-2 formation.
74',action,"Rispoli does his best to try and carry the ball up the right flank and dance through the Inter defence, but Ansaldi does well to battle with his counterpart and win possession back from the full-back."
72',substitution,; Balogh enters the field for Bruno Henrique.
72',action,"The tempo in this match has seemed to settle since the goal with neither side really pressing for an opportunity, but it's clear Palermo aren't sitting as deep any more in this fixture."
70',action,This could be an interesting final 20 minutes as Palermo are now forced to come out from sitting deep. They must be very careful not to allow Inter to counter-attack and ultimately kill of this game as a contest.
67',action,"With Inter firmly in control, it's vital they don't sit back and allow Palermo to apply pressure now. They're clearly a far superior side than the Eagles and they must make that show for the remainder of this match."
65',assist,Assist Antonio Candreva ; Fantastic work on the right flank from Candreva as the Italian wingers patiently waited for the right time to cross and managed to find Joao Mario in the middle with a great delivery.
65',goal,Goal João Mário Naval da Costa Eduardo ; GOAL! Stefano Pioli will be happy with his sub! Joao Mario pulls away from his marker in the box and volleys the ball home from close range past Posavec.
64',action,This could be very long 25 minutes for Palermo. The hosts have barely been out of their half in the last 10 minutes and it won't be long before Inter start making more attacking subs.
63',yellow-card,Yellow Card Alessandro Gazzi ; Gazzi collects a yellow card for a pull on Joao Mario.
62',action,"SAVE! A fantastic through ball from Brozovic is curled around the Palermo defence for Icardi who attemps to poke the ball past Posavec, but once again the goalkeeper is in the way and keeps the score level."
60',action,"CLOSE! A poor clearance from Goldaniga falls to Perisic on the edge of the box, the winger then decides to cut onto his right foot and whip a shot to the far post but it goes just wide of Posavec's goal."
58',action,"Inter really need to come up with some new ideas here is they want to break down Palermo. Whilst the away side a firmly on the front foot, they still don't quite look like scoring as they force long balls forward."
56',action,"CHANCE! A deep corner is headed back across goal to Gagliardini who attempts and acrobatic effort on goal, but despite connecting with the ball cleanly his shot is deflected behind."
55',substitution,; First sub of the match as Banega comes off for Joao Mario.
54',action,"Palermo are starting to drop deep and surrender territory to the visitors, which could be the start of a slippery slope as the home side clear danger but all that does it allow the away side a chance to refresh their attack."
52',action,"Considering Palermo have almost conceded on average two goals per game, their performance at the back so far has been fairly impressive. There has only been one notable clear chance for Inter so far in this match."
50',action,"First shot of the half comes from Inter Milan as the ball rolls through to Perisic and the winger comes inside to beat Cionek to the play, but the Croatian is unable to generate decent power on his effort and Posavec collects with ease."
48',action,"The second half has started at a very quick tempo, with Palermo shifting the ball around with pace around the pitch, but at the moment they're just unable to keep hold of possession."
46',action,The second half is underway!
,action,"Half time and it's 0-0 at the Stadio Renzo Barbera. Inter have certainly had the best chance of the match through Icardi, but Palermo have looked troublesome in parts."
45',action,"A free-kick on the edge of Palermo's box is presented to Inter as Icardi takes the duties, but despite getting good power and curl on the effort, he didn't manage to keep his shot under the crossbar."
44',yellow-card,Yellow Card Edoardo Goldaniga ; Goldaniga collects a yellow card for a foul on the edge of the box.
43',action,"A through ball from Ansaldi is met by Perisic on the wing as he attempts to whip a cross into Icardi, but Gonzalez does really well to slide and push the ball out for a corner kick which is clearer by the Palermo defence."
41',action,"A free-kick in a dangerous position is whipped into the box by Banega, which is only met by a pink shirt in the box. However, the clearance falls only as far as Brozovic who opts to shoot on goal, but his effort is charged down by the home side."
38',action,"CLOSE! An unintended back pass from Gazzi is almost turned into the bottom corner as the midfielder stumbled, but fortunately for Palermo, Posavec was awake to the danger and pounced on the play."
36',action,"The odds may be stacked against Palermo, but there is a lot of fight in The Eagles. The home side are trying everything to take the game to Inter Milan and are causing issues."
35',yellow-card,Yellow Card Danilo D'Ambrosio ; D'Ambrosio collects a yellow for a silly foul in midfield.
34',action,"Appeals for a penalty are turned down by the referee after pinball in the Inter box results in cries from the home side for a spot kick, but the replay showed the ball struck Gagliardini in the face rather than the arm."
32',action,"Jajalo manages to create a rare opportunity for Palermo as he brings down a drilled cross well, but Murillo does well to usher the midfielder out for a corner kick which is eventually punched away by Handanovic."
30',action,"SAVE! Brozovic unleases a rocket from range which was flying into the top corner, but Posavec dives to his left to get a strong hand on the shot and keep Inter at bay."
28',action,"Posavec is called into action again as a drilled cross from Candreva looks dangerous as Icardi looks to attack it, but the goalkeeper does well to dive across his six yard box to push the ball away to safety."
26',action,"This is starting to turn into a stop-start match as Quaison is fouled 30 yards away from goal after pinching the ball away from Inter, but Brozovic makes the decision to bring the forward to the ground."
24',action,"SAVE! A fantastic save from Posavec as this match comes alive. Inter pass the ball around the Palermo box with Icardi stabbing a pass through to Candreva, but the Italian's shot is pushed away from goal by the goalkeeper as the score remains level."
22',yellow-card,Yellow Card Cristian Daniel Ansaldi ; Ansaldi collects Inter's first yellow card of the match.
22',action,"CHANCE! Quaison pushes off Murillo and manages to escape the defender as a twists in from the left hand side, but the forward's effort on goal is poor as he drags his shot into the side netting."
20',action,"A slight stoppage in play as Gagliardini does down clutching his face following a battle with Nestorovski, with the replay showing the striker's elbow accidently hit him in the face."
19',yellow-card,Yellow Card Ilija Nestorovski ; Nestorovski collects a yellow for the elbow.
18',action,"Inter have managed to calm the Palermo storm now as momentum firmly switches in favour of the away side. Despite this, there hasn't been another opportunity to seriously test Posavec again."
15',action,It seems as is Inter are really looking to prey on Palermo's horrible defensive record. When the away side are attacking they're committing serious numbers forward in order to completely overrun the hosts.
13',action,"It looks like Inter may be starting to wake up as the away side get their first corner of the match, however the delivery into the middle is poor and Palermo manage to clear at the near post."
11',action,"CHANCE! It should be 1-0 to Inter. A fantastic pass from Brozovic is brought down extremely well by Icardi, but despite getting the best of Gonzalez the Argentinian striker fires straight at Posavec."
9',action,"Inter Milan have barely managed to get out of their half so far. Palermo have started the match brightly and look dangerous as they attack, but the high defensive line from the visitors is inviting pressure upon themselves."
7',action,"Jajalo plays a floated ball over the top to Quaison who races behind the Inter defence and cuts the ball back into the penalty area, but a fantastically timed tackle from Ansaldi pokes the play away from Nestorovski for a corner."
5',action,"Palermo are attacking early at the Renzo Barbera and it's Nestorovski who is causing all the issues. The striker drifts off to the left side and unleashes a shot across goal, but fortunately for the visitors his effort is just wide of the mark."
3',action,"Mistake at the back from Miranda almost presents a good opportunity for Nestorovski in the early stages, but the striker is unable to pace away from the defender to tracks back to recover from his error."
1',action,Inter get the match underway!
,action,"Meanwhile, Inter have gone for a host of changes from the side that progressed against Bologna in the Copa Italia. With a largely rotated side in that fixture, a magnitude of changes were to be expected."
,action,"Corini has decided to go with three changes from the side which started against Sassuollo last time out. The Eagles were on the wrong end of a 4-1 scoreline in their previous fixture, so it appears as if they’re lining up a bit more defensively this afternoon."
,action,"Subs: Andreolli, Joao Mario, Kondogbia, Palacio, Biabiany, Ranocchia, Medel, Santon, Martines, Carrizo, Nagatomo, Gabriel."
,action,"Inter Milan (4-2-3-1): Handanovic; Ansaldi, Miranda, Murillo, D’Ambrosio; Brozovic, Gagliardini; Perisic, Banega, Candreva; Icardi."
