,action,"Under the circumstances, the point will feel like a defeat for West Ham, who bossed the game for 87 minutes but could only find the back of the net once, despite how often they put Watford under pressure. The home side were forced on to the back foot for almost the entire evening, but they did well to deal with most of what the Hammers threw at them."
,action,FULL-TIME: WATFORD 1-1 WEST HAM UNITED
90'+4',action,"Goalmouth scramble! The set-piece pinballs around the West Ham penalty area as the visitors desperately try to clear the danger. They're unable to do so and the ball falls to Deeney, but the striker's downward header bounces just an inch or two past Success in front of goal. Any sort of contact from the Nigerian surely would have won the game for the home side!"
90'+3',action,"Success is caught by Cresswell as he bursts down the right wing, giving Watford once final chance to thump the ball into the penalty area. Cleverley does so as he tries to pick out Capoue, but it bounces off the back of Fonte and out for a corner over on the left flank."
90'+1',substitution,"; West Ham have made a late, defensive change as they aim to hold on to a point, with Lanzini making way for Edimilson Fernandes."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be three minutes of added time.
89',action,"Great interception by Holebas! Cresswell whips another wonderful cross into the Watford penalty area and over to Feghouli, but Holebas is just about able to get a head on the ball to send it away from the Algerian and out for a corner."
88',action,"Excellent opportunity for Britos! Watford smell blood as they immediately push forward on a determined attack, and they do well to win themselves a corner. It's whipped into the heart of the penalty area and finds Britos, but the striker is unable to guide his header on goal and sends it looping over the top of the crossbar."
86',yellow-red,"Yellow/Red Michail Antonio ; RED CARD! Antonio scoops the ball into his grasp after being brought down from behind, and he did so despite the referee's whistle was blown, leaving the man in charge no choice but to show him a second yellow card. Bilic looks incredibly irate in the dugout."
86',action,"West Ham clumsily lose possession in the middle of the pitch, and this time it's Watford who counter swiftly. Success darts down the left wing on a great run before trying to penetrate the penalty area, but he loses out to a great tackle from Fonte."
85',action,"Great tackle by Holebas! Success loses out in the middle of the pitch and West Ham counter-attack quickly, but Feghouli loses out to a wonderful interception from Holebas just inside the box."
84',action,"Cresswell is unable to make the set-piece count, however, as he fires a poor low cross straight into the wall camped on the edge of the penalty area."
83',yellow-card,"Yellow Card José Holebas ; Lanzini causes all sorts of problems for Holebas over on the right wing as he dances past the Greek defender, and he eventually wins West Ham a free-kick after being dragged down near to the byline."
82',substitution,"; Watford have made a late alteration, with Isaac Success coming on to replace Niang."
81',action,"A lofted pass is flung up towards the Watford penalty area and causes the home side a few problems as it bounces dangerously towards Antonio, but Gomes is just about able to deal with the danger before clattering into Kaboul. It looks as if the centre-back is going to be okay though."
79',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Abdoulaye Doucouré ; A half-hearted Watford attack breaks down and allows West Ham to counter quickly, but he's unable to make it into the hosts' half of the pitch after being cynically dragged back by Doucoure, who's shown a yellow card as a result."
77',action,"Ayew picks up the ball in a pocket of space in the middle of the pitch and quickly tees up Cresswell. The full-back charges down the left wing and then curls a bouncing cross towards the near post, but it receives a slight deflection that sends it into the hands of Gomes."
75',action,"Watford pile plenty of bodies forward as they try to find a way back in front once again. They initially work the ball around well over on the left wing before it's sent to Capoue, but the midfielder's poked pass finds Deeney in an offside position and the linesman's flag is quickly raised."
73',goal,"Goal André Ayew Pelé ; GOAL! There it is! West Ham have equalised! Antonio breaks down the left channel on an excellent run as he easily beats Kaboul. He then flies into the penalty area and unleashes a rocket of a shot that somehow hits both posts before rolling out to Ayew, who is easily able to poke the ball into the back of the net from close range."
71',action,"Lanzini, who has arguably been West Ham's best player since the break, weaves around on the edge of the Watford box once again before trying to test Gomes from 20 yards out, but there's slightly too much power behind the strike and it sails a few yards over the top of the crossbar."
70',action,"What a chance for Antonio! Cresswell picks up the ball in a pocket of space over on the left flank and quickly whips a beautiful bouncing cross into the penalty area. It flies past two defenders before reaching Antonio at the far post, but the forward's downward header somehow fails to hit the target."
68',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Tom Cleverley ; Lanzini twists and turns over on the right wing before being caught by an outstretched foot from Niang, and Cleverley is then shown a yellow card for kicking the ball away. West Ham are awarded a free-kick in a promising position but are unable to make it count after sending it short."
67',action,"West Ham are increasingly upping the tempo of their attacks as they desperately try to find an equaliser. They're absolutely dominating possession at the moment and look close to finally finding the back of the net. But, for the time being, Watford are just about managing to hold on."
65',substitution,"; West Ham have made an attacking change as they try to find a way into the game, with Andre Ayew coming on to replace Snodgrass, who has been disappointing this evening."
65',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Cheikhou Kouyaté ; Ouch! Kouyate flies into Niang and brings the Frenchman crashing to the ground with a hefty challenge, leaving the referee with no choice but to produce a yellow card."
64',action,"Kouyate rises high midway inside the West Ham half of the pitch and does well to bring an end to an attempted Watford attack. He nods the ball down to Feghouli and sets up the winger to counter-attack, but he loses out to Holebas and is unable to carve out a chance on goal."
62',action,"Another great stop by Gomes! The free-kick is curled into the heart of the penalty area and bounces over to Fonte, but the defender is unable to guide his headed effort into the top right-hand corner of the net and loses out to a wonderful save by Gomes."
61',action,"A cross-field pass from Noble finds Kouyate, who brings the ball down well before teeing up Feghouli on the edge of the penalty area. The Algerian tries to quickly spin round Cleverley but loses out to the midfielder, who gives away a free-kick in a very dangerous position."
59',action,"What a save by Gomes! Lanzini causes plenty of problems for the Watford back line once again before sending another dangerous cross into a great position, but this time it's Gomes who's able to get a hand on the ball to push it away from Antonio at the far post."
58',action,"Lovely play by West Ham! Lanzini dances his way into the Watford penalty area on a wonderful run before lifting a looping cross over to the far post. Snodgrass rises high as he tries to beat Cathcart in the air, but the defender comes out on top at the vital moment."
56',action,"Feghouli is caught from behind by Cathcart as he powers forward, resulting in a free-kick for West Ham in a dangerous position over on the right wing. Snodgrass steps up and curls a dangerous cross into the box, but Kaboul is there to meet it."
54',action,"A looping cross is chipped into the middle of the West Ham penalty area and finds Deeney, who does well to rise high above his marker. He then quickly sets up Cleverley with a downward header, but the midfielder's first touch is a heavy one and sends the ball bouncing into the hands of Randolph."
53',action,"Niang muscles his way into the left-hand side of the West Ham box and latches on to a downward header before doing well to win the hosts a corner. It's curled into the penalty area and towards the near post, but Obiang is there to clear the danger comfortably."
52',substitution,; Janmaat gingerly makes his way off the pitch to be replaced by Cathcart.
51',action,"It now looks as if Janmaat is struggling with what might be a slight injury, so Craig Cathcart is getting ready to come on and replace the Dutchman. It hasn't been the luckiest of days for Mazzarri!"
49',action,"Big call by the referee! Kouyate charges his way down the right flank and into the Watford penalty area before tangling with Niang. Both players go down before all of the West Ham players scream for a penalty, but the referee isn't at all interested with their pleas and instead awards a free-kick the other way."
47',action,"West Ham start brightly as they immediately put Watford under pressure. Feghouli gets himself into good positions on two occasions before whipping crosses into the penalty area, but the first is headed away by Janmaat before Kaboul gets a head to the second one."
46',action,We're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"After a lengthy delay, the referee finally brings an end to a first half that has seen Watford move a step closer to lifting themselves into the top half of the table. Zarate did well to win a very early penalty before Deeney converted it with aplomb, and since then West Ham have dominated possession without doing much with it. Antonio has looked bright in front of goal but has failed to properly test Gomes, whilst both Lanzini and Snodgrass have struggled to get into the game."
,action,HALF-TIME: WATFORD 1-0 WEST HAM UNITED
45'+10',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Michail Antonio ; The ball bounces around the Watford penalty aarea dangerously before finally falling to Behrami, who then blasts it away from danger. He's quickly clattered into by Antonio, however, and the West Ham forward becomes the latest player to be booked as a result."
45'+9',substitution,; It's Doucoure who comes on to the pitch to replace Zarate in a change that Mazzarri wouldn't have wanted to make at this stage of the game.
45'+8',action,Both sets of fans give Zarate a rousing round of applause as he's stretchered off the pitch and straight down the tunnel.
45'+6',action,"Zarate has been handed an oxygen mask, which is never a good sign when a player is down injured. His leg is also now encased in a large protective cast, and the medical staff are getting ready to take him off the pitch for further treatment."
45'+4',action,Zarate is still on the floor receiving medical treatment. It looks as if Abdoulaye Doucoure is going to come on for Zarate when the Argentine is able to be stretchered off the pitch.
45'+2',action,"Things don't look good for Zarate, who has gone down once again and seems to be in real pain. The medical staff are on the pitch with a stretcher and it looks as if his game has come to a premature end."
45'+1',action,"What a chance for Snodgrass! Cresswell flies past Niang on a wonderful run before firing an excellent pass across the face of goal. Gomes manages to get a hand on the ball but can only push it to Snodgrass, who tries to unleash a quick shot but lets himself down with a poor first touch."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be two minutes of added time.
44',action,"Poor play by Holebas! The full-back is left in acres of space over on the left flank as he flies forward on a marauding run, but he holds on to the ball for far too long and is dispossessed by Jose Fonte before he's able to tee up Deeney, who was in a great position in front of goal."
42',action,"Watford do well to deal with the danger once again before Cresswell tries to test Gomes from long range, but, like Snodgrass' similar effort earlier in the half, his audacious effort is watched by the Brazilian as it sails over the top of the crossbar."
41',action,"Antonio goes close! He lifts a lovely flick over the head of Britos and darts into the Watford penalty area before shooting, but he's put off by the Uruguayan centre-back at the vital moment and ends up firing his half-volley off Kaboul and out for a corner."
39',action,"Another clumsy challenge results in a free-kick for West Ham as the visitors continue to pile forward. Again it's sent short, and it fails to result in a chance on goal after Watford press well in the middle of the pitch."
37',action,"Lanzini decides to shoot from the free-kick, despite the angle being tight, and his effort ends up flying several yards over the top of the crossbar, much to the annoyance of his team-mates camped inside the penalty area."
36',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Daryl Janmaat ; Lanzini is caught from behind by Niang and West Ham are awarded a free-kick. It's sent short before being worked over to Antonio, who rounds Kaboul far too easily before being caught by an outstretched leg from Janmaat, resulting in another free-kick for the visitors and a yellow card for the Dutchman."
35',action,"After a lengthy period spent on the back foot, Watford are able to win themselves a throw-in deep down the left flank. It's sent long into the penalty area and picks out Holebas, but the full-back is unable to find a team-mate with his looping header."
33',action,"West Ham patiently pass the ball around inside their own half of the pitch before Reid sets up Antonio with a lofted pass forward, but the forward is too slow in getting back from an offside position and the linesman's flag is raised as soon as he makes contact with the ball."
31',action,"Antonio chases down Kaboul and forces the centre-back into firing the ball out for a corner. The set-piece is well defended by Watford before the ball bounces out to Snodgrass, but the midfielder is unable to hit the target with his long-range effort and sends his shot flying well wide of the goal."
29',action,"Another chance for West Ham! Once again, Antonio impresses over on the left flank before poking a pass into the path of Snodgrass. He darts into the penalty area and meets the ball before trying to fire it over to Feghouli, but Gomes is there to pounce on the pass at the vital moment."
27',action,"Holebas steps off Feghouli and allows the Algerian to swing a dangerous cross into the Watford penalty area and over to Antonio. The winger sticks out a foot as he battles with Daryl Janmaat, but he catches the Dutchman from behind as he does so and gives away a free-kick."
25',action,"A determined Watford attacking move comes to an end, and West Ham are quickly able to hit the home side on a swift counter-attack. Antonio flies down the left flank on a great run before trying to swing a cross into the penalty area, but Valon Behrami sticks to him like glue and stops the winger from teeing up Snodgrass."
23',action,"Zarate seems to have made a full recovery, and he's able to come back on to the pitch once again. Watford continue putting West Ham under pressure as they try to find a second goal, but a looping header into the box is well dealt with by Winston Reid at the near post."
21',action,"Zarate gingerly makes his way off the pitch to receive further medical treatment, and the game gets underway once again with a free-kick. It's fired over to Deeney, who then nods the ball down to Holebas, but the Greek defender loses out to Feghouli and is unable to swing a cross into the penalty area."
20',action,"There's a brief break in play and a few worrying moments for Watford after Zarate is caught from behind on the halfway line. He seemed to receive a boot to the top of the foot, leaving him in serious discomfort in a heap on the floor."
18',action,"What a block by Younes Kaboul! Holebas is beaten far too easily by Feghouli, who then skips into the box and tees up Snodgrass. The midfielder is all alone and immediately shoots, but he's closed down by Kaboul and loses out to the Frenchman."
16',action,"Antonio attempts to battle his way through a sea of yellow shirts before behind caught by Zarate, resulting in a free-kick for West Ham in a promising position. Snodgrass steps up and curls a cross into the heart of the box, but Britos is there to clear the danger."
14',action,"The set-piece fails to result in a chance on goal for the home side before the ball eventually bounces out to Etienne Capoue. The midfielder has a bit of space around him and decides to try and test Randolph with an audacious long-range effort, but his strike fails to hit the target and sails behind for a goal-kick."
13',action,"The ball bounces dangerously around the edge of the West Ham penalty area before Jose Holebas is finally able to find a bit of space for himself, but his low strike from 25 yards is deflected wide of the goal and out for a corner."
11',action,"Vital block by Miguel Britos! Antonio gets himself into a great position over on the left wing before swinging a dangerous cross into the heart of the penalty area, and Britos is just about able to get a foot on the ball to stop it from finding Robert Snodgrass in front of goal."
9',action,"Manuel Lanzini is able to pick up the ball just outside of the Watford penalty area, and he immediately unleashes a thumping strike. It deflects away from goal and over to Niang, who then kick-starts a quick counter-attack, but West Ham are able to get plenty of bodies back to deal with the danger."
7',action,"After a slow start to the game, West Ham are finally able to push forward on their first attack of the game. It fails to result in a chance on goal for Michail Antonio, however, as Sofiane Feghouli's header bounces into the hands of Heurelho Gomes."

1',action,"We're off! West Ham get us underway, attacking from left to right."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."

,action,"Walter Mazzarri has decided to make two changes to the Watford side that started the defeat against Manchester United, with Daryl Janmaat and Valon Behrami coming into the starting line-up to replace Craig Cathcart and Sebastian Prodl, both of whom drop to the substitutes’ bench."
,action,"West Ham United substitutes: Adrian, Masuaku, Byram, Collins, Fernandes, Calleri, Ayew."
,action,"West Ham United XI (4-2-3-1): Randolph; Kouyate, Fonte, Reid, Cresswell; Noble, Obiang; Feghouli, Lanzini, Snodgrass; Antonio."

,action,"McAuley’s last-minute goal resulted in Slaven Bilic angrily hurling a television microphone in protest, but the Croatian has only been handed a fine and won’t be suspended for today’s game. With a tough clash against Chelsea coming up in two weeks’ time, this is certainly an encounter that West Ham will be desperate to win to keep the momentum going heading into the final stretch of the season."
,action,"West Ham were thrashed 4-0 by Manchester City at the start of the month, but after suffering a miserable period towards the end of 2016, things are looking much better for the Hammers. Crystal Palace, Middlesbrough and Southampton have all fallen to the east London side in recent weeks, and West Bromwich Albion could have joined that list last weekend if it wasn’t for a Gareth McAuley equaliser in the 94th minute."
,action,"For Watford, their only disappointment in recent weeks came last weekend against Manchester United, who beat the Hornets 2-0 at Old Trafford. It brought to an end a four-game unbeaten run for Walter Mazzarri’s men, their joint-longest in the league since the Italian took charge. A win here today would move them into the top half of the table, a place they’d very much like to be ahead of three consecutive games against opponents from the bottom half."
,action,"Thanks to positive results in recent weeks, both Watford and West Ham have managed to open up a relatively comfortable amount of space between themselves and the relegation zone. Towards the end of last year, the two teams looked as if they were in danger of slipping perilously close to the bottom three, but just one defeat in five games for each means that they are temporarily free of trouble."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Premier League game between Watford and West Ham United at Vicarage Road.
