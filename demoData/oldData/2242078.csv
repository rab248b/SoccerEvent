,action,Thank you for joining us today - see you next time!!
,action,"West Ham travel next weekend to the Stadium of Light, where they face rock bottom Sunderland. Swansea face a tricky away tie against Watford."
,action,"Swansea remain in deep trouble. Hull City's defeat to Manchester City today means they are still only two points adrift of safety, but Paul Clement will need to find a means to pick his side up and start winning games before it is too late."
,action,It has been over two months since Slaven Bilic's side last won a Premier League game. But they have their victory today. Cheikhou Kouyaté's swerving strike into the bottom right turns out to be the decider and West Ham move six points clear of their opponents and away from the threat of relegation.
90'+6',action,Full-time.
90'+5',action,An ambitious pass to slide Sigurdsson into the box rolls harmlessly to Randolph. That should be that.
90'+4',yellow-card,Yellow Card Darren Randolph ; Darren Randolph goes into the referee's book for time wasting.
90'+4',action,Gylfi Sigurdsson is played into the box but he is unable to get the ball out of his feet and the ball drifts harmlessly out for a goal kick.
90'+4',action,West Ham fans are upping the noise here in the London Stadium as they cheer their team over the line.
90'+2',action,Heading into the final three minutes here and Swansea look toothless. They have not looked like scoring at all this game. The signs are worrying for the welsh club.
90'+1',action,Five minutes added on. It is now or never for the Swans.
90',action,What an opportunity that was to seal the points for West Ham. A brilliant piece of skill by Lanzini allows him to skip past two Swansea players before firing a powerful cross across the box. Calleri gets on the end of it but his strike hits the side netting.
89',action,Time is running out for Paul Clement's side as they search for an equaliser.
86',substitution,"; That attempt was Ayew's last contribution for West Ham, as he is replaced by Edimilson Fernandes."
86',action,"Another opportunity for West Ham to seal the three points goes begging. Calleri swings the ball in from the right and Ayew meets it with his head, but it is straight at Fabianski."
84',action,A good chance for West Ham falls to Ayew in the Swansea box. His driving effort is too close to Fabianski who tips it behind for a corner. Lanzini swings it in and it is comfortably collected by the Swansea keeper. Both sides now trying to get a decisive goal.
83',action,Swansea are starting to turn up the tempo now. West Ham hanging on.
81',yellow-card,Yellow Card André Ayew Pelé ; André Ayew is in the book for a foul in the build up to Narsingh's shot.
81',action,"Should have done better. Luciano Narsingh is played through into the right of the penalty area, his right foot curling effort flies over the bar at the near post. Randolph had it well covered."
80',action,"Sigurdsson swings in a wonderful cross from a corner but there was no white shirt to get on the end of it, Leeroy Fer coming closest."
78',action,Lanzini takes and it just flies narrowly wide of the left post. He is getting closer each time with these free-kicks.
77',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Federico Fernández ; A free-kick in a dangerous position for West Ham. Jordan Ayew attempts to skip around Federico Fernandez, who trips the Frenchman. Yellow Card for Fernandez."
75',action,15 minutes left to go. Swansea really need to find a way to get back into this but at the moment neither side look like scoring.
74',action,Lanzini's swings a cross into the box but it is headed away safely by Fernando Llorente.
73',action,"Mark Noble gets in behind the Swansea defence after a quick one two with Lanzini, but is stopped in his tracks on the edge of the left of the box. Free-kick West Ham."
71',substitution,; Snodgrass is off. He hasn't had much of an impact today although did provide the assist for the goal. On comes Sofiane Feghouli.
65',substitution,; Cork's day is up. He goes off injured to be replaced by Jefferson Montero. Paul Clement going for the equaliser here with a more attacking midfield setup. No Ki for now.
60',action,Jack Cork down injured for Swansea. He challenges for an aerial ball and it looks like he landed awkwardly. Ki Sung-yueng is told to warm up.
57',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Manuel Lanzini ; A good bit of pressure from West Ham as the ball falls to Lanzini on the edge of the box. He tries to find space and drive into the box where he goes down, hoping for a penalty. The referee gives it the other way and Lanzini is booked for simulation."
53',action,Swansea on the front foot at the moment. Those half time changes by Paul Clement have given the Swans a bit more of an attacking threat.
52',action,"A good chance for Swansea goes begging. Jordan Ayew's cross into the box finds Leeroy Fer, who decides to chest the ball down and pass instead of heading it."
49',action,Ayew's pass across the Swansea box bounces to Byram who's right footed drive hits the side netting. Swansea can breathe a sigh of relief. Missed opportunity for West Ham.
47',action,Early pressure from West Ham leads to a corner. Lanzini swings it in and Swansea get it clear.
46',substitution,; Luciano Narsingh replaces Wayne Routledge. Clement wants his side to go for this. They really can not afford defeat today.
46',substitution,; Fernando Llorente on for Tom Carroll.
45',action,Second half under way.
,action,Huge 45 minutes coming up for both sides. Neither can afford defeat today.
,action,"A timid first half until Kouyaté's goal, and what an important goal it was. As things stand Slaven Bilic's side will move eight points clear of Swansea in the relegation places. West Ham have been leaking goals as of late but they haven't looked in much danger of conceding against a Swansea side carry little threat."
45'+2',action,Half-time at the London Stadium. Kouyaté's strike separates the sides at the break.
45',yellow-card,Yellow Card Cheikhou Kouyaté ; Cheikhou Kouyaté is booked for going into the crowd to celebrate his goal with the Hammers fans.
44',assist,"Assist Robert Snodgrass ; A well-placed lay off from Robert Snodgrass to play Kouyaté into space on the edge of the Swansea box, allowing the Frenchman to drive forward and hammer the ball into the bottom right."
44',goal,Goal Cheikhou Kouyaté ; GOOOOOOOOOOAL! What a goal by Cheikhou Kouyaté! Snodgrass plays a lay off into the path of Kouyaté who runs into the space on the edge of the Swansea area. He unleashes a powerful swerving drive with his right foot which curls just beyond the finger tips and into the bottom right corner. 1-0 West Ham.
41',action,Sigurdsson's free-kick drops low to the left of the goal and Darren Randolph dives low to smother it.
40',substitution,; Michael Antonio is coming off injured for West Ham. He's been one of their better players today. Jonathan Calleri replaces him.
38',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Mark Noble ; Booking for Mark Noble for a foul on the edge of the West Ham box. That's his 10th of the season, meaning he will miss their next two games."
36',action,"Good run down the right by Ayew for Swansea, his cross just missing the feet of Gylfi Sigurdsson."
32',action,"Sigurdsson's corner is swung into Hernandez, whose header hits Routledge about two yards from goal, but the Swansea man is unable to find a white shirt."
31',action,The game is starting to liven up again. Swansea break forward and a cross into the box is cleared out for their first corner.
30',action,Andre Ayew at the other end! The West Ham man finds a bit of space in the box and curls a left footed shot towards the far post. Fabianski dives low and parries it safe.
27',action,First real sense of attacking threat from Swansea. Jordan Ayew gets to the byline and manages to turn Jose Fonte and run towards the six yard box. His pass across the box is intercepted and cleared out by James Collins
26',action,Swansea have been poor so far. They've offered nothing in attack and haven't really put the West Ham defence under any pressure.
24',action,Lanzini tries his luck from the edge of the box but it flies over the bar. He's been lively in this opening 25 minutes.
22',action,"A rare attacking opportunity for Swansea comes to nothing. A long throw into the box is comfortably cleared out, before a strong pass hits Martin Olsson on the hand. Free-kick West Ham."
20',action,"Close! A good cross from Byram finds Antonio at the edge of the box. The midfielder steps out and chips a cross to the back post which finds the head of Snodgrass. Fabianski smothers it on the line, good save from the Swansea keeper."
15',action,"Not a bad effort from Lanzini. His right-foot strike curves just over the bar, dipping a little later than he would have wanted."
14',action,"Manuel Lanzini fouled by Jordan Ayew about 30 yards from the box. Quite central this free-kick, could be a chance for West Ham. Lanzini stands over it."
12',action,"Snodgrass' delivery is poor, with the corner flying straight out for a goal kick."
11',action,Great strength and awareness by Antonio. He brings the ball down and turns into the box. He slightly overruns the ball and it is cleared out for the first corner of the game.
9',action,Strong run from Antonio into the box. He tumbles just outside the area and the referee blows away his claims for a foul. West Ham are looking up for this.
7',action,Jordan Ayew makes a good run down the right for Swansea but his cross is easily blocked out for a throw.
6',action,Noble's free kick into the Swansea area comfortably headed back out to the halfway line.
5',action,"Tense start to the first half in the London Stadium. A few free kicks already and neither team being able to make much headway. West Ham fans making a lot of noise, trying to spur their team on."
1',action,And we're under way!
,action,No changes for Swansea. Paul Clement sticks with the same side that lost to Tottenham. Fernando Llorrente makes the bench after missing the last two games through injury.
,action,Only the one change for the Hammers from their 3-0 defeat to Arsenal. The injured Andy Carroll being replaced by Robert Snodgrass.
,action,"Swansea substitutes: Amat, Ki Sung-yueng, Llorente, Nordfelt, Montero, Narsingh, Kingsley."
,action,"Swansea XI: Fabianski; Naughton, Fernandez, Mawson, Olsson; Fer, Cork, Carroll, Routledge, Sigurdsson; Ayew."
,action,"West Ham substitutes: Nordtveit, Feghouli, Carroll, Adrian, Sakho, Calleri, Fernandes."
,action,"West Ham XI: Randolph; Byram, Fonte, Collins, Masuaku; Kouyaté, Noble, Antonio, Lanzini, Snodgrass; Ayew."
,action,"Swansea collapsed to three late goals in their defeat to Tottenham on Wednesday, leaving them two points adrift of safety behind Hull. The Swans have only won once in their last five outings and a win today would be a huge boost to their survival hopes."
,action,West Ham head into this fixture having not won for over two months. Their last victory coming in a 3-1 win over Southampton in February. Slaven Bilic has been facing intense speculation over his future and a poor result today would do nothing to quash those rumours.
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to this live text commentary for the crucial relegation clash between West Ham United and Swansea City.
