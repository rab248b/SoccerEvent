,action,"FULL-TIME! Real Madrid find themselves in control heading into the second leg, courtesy of a 2-1 win over 10-man Bayern Munich at Allianz Arena. A Cristiano Ronaldo brace did the damage to Die Roten, after Vidal opened the scoring for the hosts and then missed a penalty on the stroke of half time. Ancelotti's men certainly have it all to do when they travel to Estadio Santiago Bernabeu next week. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+2',action,"OFFSIDE! Sergio Ramos heads home from a Kroos free-kick delivery, but the Real Madrid captain was caught just the wrong side of his man while doing so. Great decision."
90'+1',substitution,"; Kovacic freshens things up in midfield for Real Madrid, with Modric jogging off."
90',yellow-card,Yellow Card Arturo Erasmo Vidal Pardo ; Vidal gets a yellow card for kicking James and then reacting angrily to the referee's decision to award a free-kick.
89',action,"The hosts are tiring badly, with Ancelotti's men probably looking for the final whistle already. Real Madrid continue to move the ball and work a man over, with a cross from Marco Asensio flicked to safety this time. The visitors want another."
87',action,"Bayern are forced to sit deep to avoid further punishment, with the away fans cheering every completed pass at this stage of the game. Since gaining the extra man advantage, Real Madrid have been excellent. Marcelo curls a cross to the back post, but Ronaldo miscontrols!"
85',action,"Ancelotti isn't looking too impressed heading into the last five minutes, with Real Madrid having all of the ball and the pressure. Robben tries to release Coman in behind Marcelo, but Sergio Ramos steps out to make a good tackle. The visitors try to counter, but a speculative throughball towards Ronaldo is gathered by Neuer."
83',substitution,"; James is introduced in place of Benzema, with Zidane perhaps looking to the weekend already. The Frenchman's final contribution was to find the back of the net at the end of an offside move, with him looking up from the disappointment to see his number was up."
81',substitution,"; Coman is introduced for the final 10 minutes at Allianz Arena, with the quiet Muller replaced. Robben cuts in from the right and shoots, but Navas is there to make a simple save."
80',action,"Just wide from Marcelo! The Brazilian left-back is found in a pocket of space at the back post, with Lahm quickly racing forth to try and make a block. He shoots with his favoured left foot, but a powerful shot curls wickedly wide of the upright."
79',action,"Neuer is happy to run down the clock a little bit when he has the ball in his grasp, as Bayern have let this one get away from them. Real Madrid have been much-improved in the second half, with Martinez's dismissal handing them almost total control. Modric shoots from range but Neuer collects."
77',assist,Assist Marco Asensio Willemsen ; Marco Asensio curls in a very inviting cross from the left-hand side that Ronaldo meets graciously.
77',goal,"Goal Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro ; GOOOOOOOAL! RONALDO MAKES IT 2-1! That goal was minutes in the making, with Neuer eventually beaten. The Portugal international was picked out deep in the penalty area by Marco Asensio and guides a finish through Neuer's legs and into the back of the net."
75',action,"GREAT SAVE NEUER! Ronaldo belts a close-range effort within reach of the Bayern goalkeeper, and the Germany international uses an incredibly strong wrist to deny the Portuguese forward. He just won't be beaten again."
74',action,"Simple stop for Neuer this time! Marco Asensio checks infield and lets fly with his left foot, but the Germany international gets down to his right-hand side easily to make a save."
73',action,"This game is getting very stretched indeed, with Real Madrid having lots of time and space in the midfield third. Benzema is fed through on goal brilliantly by Carvajal, before Neuer makes a top save to deny the visiting forward at close range!"
71',action,"Boateng tries to play a long ball over the top to allow Bayern to get in behind their opposition, but his pass is far too heavy and it runs behind for a goal-kick. Real Madrid build another attack, with Marco Asensio trying to bend a cross in from the right, but Alaba intercepts. Moments later, Benzema heads high and wide from a delivery from the same flank."
69',action,"Bayern muster up an attack from the left-hand side, after good work from Bernat, but a cut-back from the substitute is intercepted by Sergio Ramos easily. Neuer pounces on a deflected cross from the right-hand side soon after, as Real Madrid continue to try and pose a threat on the break."
66',action,"Real Madrid now hold all of the control. Benzema is fed to the left byline and lifts a cross shy of the penalty area, with Ribery penalised for handball while trying to bring it down to clear. Sergio Ramos and Marco Asensio stand over it, with the captain eventually shaving the side netting with a shot."
65',substitution,"; Costa is introduced into the fray for Bayern with the job of getting something out of this game for his team, as Ribery takes his leave."
64',substitution,"; Bernat comes into the game for the last 25 minutes or so to shore things up, with Xabi Alonso taking his leave."
63',action,"Xabi Alonso is the man to fill in at centre-back for the home side for the moment, with Bayern suddenly looking in real trouble. Robben is the target of a pass out wide from Thiago, but Marcelo gets in ahead of his man to make a good tackle."
61',yellow-red,"Yellow/Red Javier Martínez Aginaga ; RED CARD! Martinez gets a second yellow card within just four minutes, which takes Bayern down to 10 men for the dying stages. Silliness from the Spanish centre-back."
61',action,"Only half an hour remains for Bayern to force their home advantage. Benzema is fed in behind Martinez and brings the ball down well, but the French striker is denied by the offside flag. From looking as though they were going to struggle to get back into this one, Real Madrid look confident."
59',substitution,"; Bale takes his leave after that missed chance, with Marco Asensio replacing him."
58',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Javier Martínez Aginaga ; Bayern need to try and edge their way back ahead in this game, as otherwise Real Madrid will be in a fantastic position heading into their home leg. Martinez gets a booking for tugging Ronaldo down."
56',action,"Close from Bale! Huge chance for the away side to make it 2-1, and Neuer looks furious with his defence. Modric curls in a great ball from the right, that is met in the air by the Welshman, but his powerful header is tipped over the bar by the Bayern goalkeeper. Another great stop."
55',action,"Bayern work the ball down the right-hand side nicely, but their final pass isn't quite right yet again. Real Madrid respond with a quick break lead by Benzema, but the Frenchman drifts in from the flank and runs into traffic. This contest continues to be rather scrappy."
53',action,"Die Roten try to calm things down after the equaliser with some patient possession, with Muller having no luck up top in terms of getting in behind Real Madrid without being called as offside. Ribery brings the ball down after some neat juggling and looks for Alaba on the overlap, but Carvajal is alive to the threat."
51',action,"Benzema releases Bale in behind Boateng nicely, but a cut back from the Welshman that was looking for Ronaldo in the area is cut out by Alaba. That was a vital intervention from the Austria international. Robben tries to do the same up the other end, stabbing a throughball into Muller's path, but the Bayern forward was caught offside."
49',action,"Real Madrid suddenly are right back in this game, with Vidal's missed penalty at the end of the first half looking ever more ominous. Bayern are immediately keen to get forward through Robben, with the Dutchman still causing a host of problems down the right wing."
47',goal,"Goal Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro ; GOOOOOOOOOAL! RONALDO MAKES IT 1-1! He has been fairly quiet, but he announces himself on the scene. Carvajal cuts back a good cross from the right-hand side, which the Portugal international latches onto and guides into the bottom corner with a neat finish."
47',yellow-card,Yellow Card Xabier Alonso Olano ; Alonso gets the first yellow card of the second half after tugging back Modric cynically.
47',assist,Assist Daniel Carvajal Ramos ; Carvajal picks out his man with a lovely cross from the right flank.
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half at Allianz Arena! Vidal missed the chance to make it 2-0 just before the break, with it now the turn of Real Madrid to make him rue his wasted opportunity from the spot."
,action,"HALF-TIME! Real Madrid go into the break counting their blessing that they are just one goal behind. Vidal opened the scoring with a thumping header, before the same man went on to miss a penalty just before the interval. Bayern have dominated the ball and kept Zidane's men in their own half, with Neuer making just one save of note. This is interestingly poised."
45'+1',missed-penalty,Missed Penalty Arturo Erasmo Vidal Pardo ; OVER THE BAR! Vidal blasts the penalty into orbit. Awful attempt from the Bayern midfielder at a vital point of the game.
45',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Daniel Carvajal Ramos ; PENALTY TO BAYERN! Ribery has a shot that Carvajal blocks, with the referee pointing for a spot-kick and handball."
44',yellow-card,Yellow Card Toni Kroos ; Kroos gets a yellow card for a late challenge on Muller.
43',action,"Good stop from Neuer! The Germany international quickly gets down low to his right-hand side to push a powerful strike from Ronaldo around the post! That's about as close as Real Madrid have gone so far. Kroos takes the resulting corner short and receives the ball back, before curling a speculative effort wide of the back post."
41',action,"Wide from Vidal! Robben streaks down the right and beats Kroos all ends up with a change of pace, but a clipped back-post cross from the Netherlands international is guided shy of the near post by Bayern's first goalscorer. He will be kicking himself that he didn't at least work the goalkeeper there."
40',action,"Good chance for Muller! Lahm manages to slide a neat ball into the penalty box for Bayern's lone striker, but the German forward is tackled while attempting to get it out of his feet. The visitors clear behind for a corner, which comes to absolutely nothing. Good idea from the hosts' right-back."
39',action,"Robben is found out on the right-hand side yet again, but a low cross that is flashed into the box from the ex-Real Madrid wide man is gobbled up easily by Navas. Bayern continue to dominate in terms of both possession and territory, with Zidane's men struggling to get a foothold in the midfield battle."
37',action,"Casemiro needs treatment once again, this time after colliding with Vidal, but the Real Madrid midfielder is quickly back to his feet once the stretcher comes on. He isn't endearing himself to the home fans, that's for sure. Ancelotti's men continue to see more of the ball, but Navas remains mostly a spectator."
35',action,"Die Roten move the ball patiently, before attempting to find Alaba with a long ball over the top of Carvajal, but the pass is far too heavy and runs behind for a goal-kick. Quality in the final third is certainly lacking. Thiago and then Ribery play successive searching balls into the opposition box, but Real Madrid clear their lines before Muller can get a sniff."
33',action,"There is a brief break in play, as Casemiro goes down heavily after a challenge with Thiago, but the Brazilian midfielder looks fine to continue. He trudges off the pitch, but just might have found himself a little winded. Bayern have managed this game well so far, with their fans sounding very confident indeed."
31',action,"Marcelo is found out on the left-hand side and whips a cross in, but Ribery does well to allow the delivery to sail over the danger zone and then shepherd it behind for a goal-kick under pressure from Dani Carvajal. The final ball hasn't quite been there for Los Blancos yet."
29',action,"Real Madrid look a little bit shaken by that goal, with Bayern brimming with confidence now. It might just be that Zidane's men look to get into the break without taking any more damaging blows. As long as they can head back to the Bernabeu with a narrow disadvantage, preferably with an away goal, they're have a chance of turning the tie around at home."
27',action,"The home fans are making plenty of noise now, with the deadlock broken. Suddenly, the ball is in Real Madrid's court, with Ancelotti's men managing to edge their way in front without taking any true risks."
25',assist,Assist Thiago Alcântara do Nascimento ; Thiago whips in a back-post corner and Vidal does the rest.
25',goal,"Goal Arturo Erasmo Vidal Pardo ; GOOOOOOOOAL! VIDAL MAKES IT 1-0! The Chilean steams in at the back post to thump home a header, after losing Nacho easily. He finishes from very close range and Navas has absolutely no chance of keeping that out."
25',action,"Good effort from Ribery! The ball falls very kindly to the Frenchman on the edge of the Real Madrid box, and he doesn't think twice about hitting it first-time on the volley. His effort is deflected behind for a corner by Bale, not that he knew much about it."
24',action,"Alaba tries his luck with a long-range strike off to the left of Navas' goal, but the Austria international's effort sails about five yards wide of the target. Neither goalkeeper has been truly worried in this contest. Robben has looked to be the danger man for Bayern with his direct dribbling runs, but they've not resulted in any clear-cut chances."
22',action,"Robben bursts down the right and cuts inside Sergio Ramos, but a covering challenge denies the flying Dutchman and concedes a corner in Bayern's favour. Xabi Alonso curls it in, but Bale does well to rise high to nod away from the immediate danger zone. Real Madrid fail to truly clear their lines, but Thiago loses the rebound very quickly indeed."
20',action,"There has been an ebb and flow to the early stages of this game, but Thiago and Xabi Alonso are yet to really dictate play for the hosts. Muller hasn't had much service into feet, with Die Roten lacking a true threat. Both teams are guilty of retaining possession and then giving the ball away as soon as they try and take a risk."
18',action,"Kroos wins a corner for the away side, as they continue to offer something on the break. The ex-Bayern midfielder's set-piece delivery, however, is terrible. Real Madrid maintain their pressure, with the same man whipping in a cross from the right, which Benzema rises well to meet! The French striker plants his header into the ground, before it bounces up and hits the woodwork! Neuer pounces on the rebound."
16',action,"Ronaldo stands over the dead ball, but blasts it into the stands behind Neuer's goal, much to the delight of the home fans. Real Madrid have grown into this game a little bit, but the Bayern goalkeeper has still had precisely nothing to do so far."
15',action,"Thiago tries to wriggle a pass into the penalty box for Ribery to collect, but the Frenchman is mobbed while in possession. Real Madrid counter up the other end, with Benzema felled by an untidy foul from Boateng around 20 yards out from goal. This looks to be within Ronaldo and Bale's range."
13',action,"Bale gives the ball away in midfield, with neither team in a particular rush to impose themselves on this contest. It appears that both sides are just feeling each other out at present. Robben tries to escape down the right-hand side and to the byline, but the Dutchman strays narrowly offside while trying to get a yard's head-start on Marcelo."
11',action,"Real Madrid calm things down with a patient spell of possession, where Marcelo and Ronaldo combine down the left. A one-two between the two is intercepted, however, allowing for Bayern to try and break. Robben picks the ball up in midfield, but he is promptly tackled. Scrappy start to proceedings in Germany."
9',action,"Lahm and Robben combine brilliantly down the right-hand side, with Kroos eventually forced into fouling the Dutch winger with a late tackle. The Germany international may well be asked to cover across in front of Marcelo. The resulting free-kick is whipped into the Real Madrid box, but easily cleared."
7',action,"Real Madrid break forward and try to move the ball out to the left-hand side quickly, but they are held up. Marcelo tries to drill in a low cross from the byline, but Neuer is beaten to the delivery by Martinez, who hammers clear at the near post. Very cagey opening to this contest, with both teams afraid to make the first error."
6',action,"Bayern manage to get themseves a corner again, after Nacho was forced to clear behind from an Alaba cross. Sergio Ramos is required to intervene at the near post from the resulting delivery, but an attempted flick-on from Javi Martinez sails behind for a goal-kick. No forays forward from Los Blancos quite yet."
4',action,"The hosts continue to push on and ask all of the early questions, with Real Madrid presumably happy to sit back and absorb pressure before racing forth on the counter. Alaba and Lahm are pushing on, with Ancelotti's side playing without fear. The home fans are making a real din."
2',action,"Thiago and Lahm manage to combine earn the home side an early corner on the right-hand side, but a back-post delivery is looped easily into Navas' grasp by a header from Vidal. Immediately, Die Roten are looking to dominate possession and put the pressure on Real Madrid."
1',action,"We are underway in the first half at Allianz Arena! Real Madrid will be looking to take an away goal home with them to Spain, but Bayern seem confident of their chances of dealing their opponents' confidence a considerable blow tonight."

,action,"TEAM NEWS: Raphael Varane and Pepe are both sidelined due to injury for Real Madrid, which puts a huge amount of pressure for Nacho to perform at centre-back for the away side. Casemiro anchors the midfield, with Toni Kroos and Luka Modric flanking him. Despite Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale struggling for form, the BBC stays together, with Karim Benzema having boasted his best goalscoring form this season in the Champions League. Zidane has plenty of quality on the bench to call upon."
,action,"TEAM NEWS: Manuel Neuer is back fit to start in goal for Bayern after an injury lay-off, with Javi Martinez and Jerome Boateng making up the central defensive partnership in Mats Hummels' injury absence. Robert Lewandowski misses out altogether with a shoulder problem, which sees Thomas Muller lead the line for the hosts. Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben provide the threat from out wide, with Arturo Vidal supporting the striker centrally after claiming that Die Roten want to win by at least a couple tonight."
,action,"Real Madrid arrive after switching off in the last five minutes of their league derby with Atletico on the weekend, where Antoine Griezmann slotted home a late equaliser to make it 1-1 at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu. Zidane's men have been getting the results they need, but the good performances don't necessarily come hand in hand. Cristiano Ronaldo last scored in this competition back in September against Borussia Dortmund."
,action,"Bayern last lost a competitive game at home back in March of last year, as Mainz scraped a 2-1 Bundesliga win, but since then it has been plain sailing since Ancelotti's summer arrival. From Real Madrid's demolition of the Bavarian giants back in April 2014, they've won their following 16 consecutive European home fixtures, needing extra time just once to beat Juventus by a 4-2 scoreline."
,action,"Hello and welcome to live coverage of Real Madrid's tough away leg against Bayern Munich in the quarter-final stages of the Champions League. Three years ago, Carlo Ancelotti inspired Los Blancos to a historic 4-0 win in Munich, but now the shoe is on the other foot. The Italian is in the dugout at the Allianz Arena as Die Roten boss, with his former right-hand man Zinedine Zidane managing the visitors. This should be a cracker!"
