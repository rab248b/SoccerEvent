78',action,"OVER! Kurzawa finds space again and hammers the ball across the face of goal, only for Pionnier to palm the ball away. Di Maria almost latches on to the rebound, but Marveaux intervenes. However, his tackle goes only as far as Aurier who strikes at goal, although his effort goes well over the bar."

,action,"Montpellier lead Paris Saint-Germain at the break through Paul Lasne's strike just before the interval. It was a tepid half from both teams, but the visitors paid the price for poor defending allowing the wing-back to coast in at the back post and lob his effort into the net."
