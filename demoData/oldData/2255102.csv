,action,Full time! Dortmund come away of the long trip south with a comfortable 3-0 win with Aubameyang ending his dry spell and the visitors improving their poor form on the road.
89',action,"This match is as good as over now, but it's not defused the atmosphere inside the stadium. The Freiburg fans are still in good voice despite being outplayed all afternoon."
87',action,CLOSE! It should be 4-0. A cross to the back post from Schurrle is met by Kagawa but the Japanese international turned his header just wide of the post.
85',substitution,; Ignjovski comes on for Freiburg in the last few minutes.
85',action,"Schurrle tries his luck from range as he spotted that Schwolow was slightly out of position, but there wasn't enough venom on the shot from the German international and the goalkeeper gathered."
83',action,The fresh legs going forward for Dortmund could cause a few issues for the home side as they start to tie and opt for damange limitation as this game dies out.
82',substitution,; Reus comes off for the last few minutes to give Pulisic some game time.
81',substitution,; Aubameyang is denied his hat-trick as Schurrle replaces him.
81',action,"Aubameyang is hungry for his third! The striker does brilliantly to bring down a clipped pass from Kagawa, but just as he manages to fashion an opportunity to shoot the Freiburg defence close him down."
79',action,"A fantastic one-two on the right side almost gives Kubler some room to cross into the Dortmund box, but Bartra does really well to spot the danger and come across to sweep up."
77',action,Dortmund are just looking at seeing this match out now as they calmly knock the ball around the Schwarzwald Stadion waiting for gaps to open up in the home side's defence.
76',substitution,"; Dembele, who certainly deserves his rest, is withdrawn for Kagawa."
75',action,"Frustration is starting to settle in the Freiburg side as Phillipp is allowed a bit of space on the edge of the box and just snaps an effort towards goal, but his long drive goes over the crossbar."
72',action,"CLOSE! Niederlechner continues to have an impact on this match since his introduction as Frantz does well to find the striker with a cross, but his acrobatic effort goes wide of Burki's post."
70',assist,Assist Erik Durm ; Fantastic awareness from Durm to cut the ball back to Aubameyang despite running through on goal after a pass from Castro.
70',goal,Goal Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ; But now they are! Aubameyang is given another goal on a plate as he backheels a shot into an attempt net and kills this match as a contest.
70',action,"Dembele once again twists and turns, this time inside the box, and drills a shot low at goal but into the side netting, which fools some Dortmund fans at the other end of the pitch who thought they'd gone 3-0 up."
69',action,"CLOSE! Dembele used his skill and pace to round two Freiburg defenders and hang a cross to the back post for Aubameyang to attack, but the Gabon international headers over the crossbar."
67',action,It seems as if Dortmund are starting to slow down the tempo since going two goals in front which has given the hosts a bit of belief to getting back into the fixture.
67',yellow-card,Yellow Card Maximilian Philipp ; First yellow card of the match goes to Philipp for a foul on Bartra.
65',action,Niederlechner didn't take long to make an impact on the match as the striker got between Bartra and Sokratis to collect a pass from Grifo and force Burki into a save.
64',substitution,; Petersen's leg isn't risked as he comes off for Niederlechner.
63',action,"A slight scare for Freiburg as Petersen fails to control a ball and proceeds to limp whilst holding his calf. The striker is continuing to play at the moment, though."
61',action,Freiburg are being forced to come out of their shape now as they chace this match and they're enjoying a better spell of possession than they have all match.
59',action,"STAT: Tuchel is currently looking for his 100th win as a Bundesliga coach, currently sitting on 99."
57',action,"Freiburg get the opportunity to push some men into the Dortmund box as they win a corner, but the delivery wasn't good enough and Burki was able to come off his line and catch the ball with ease."
55',assist,Assist Marco Reus ; Reus does fantastic to knock the ball between Soyuncu's legs and round the defender before crossing to the unmarked Aubameyang at the back post.
55',goal,Goal Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ; GOAL! Aubameyang ends his dry spell by stabbing home from close range after peeling off Terrejon and doubling Dortmund's lead.
55',action,"A corner for Dortmund is whipped into the box, but the delivery was poor and far too deep for anybody in a yellow shirt to meet at the back post."
53',action,"Soyuncu is having a fantastic match for Freiburg. In the first half he made some fantastic tackles to keep the score 1-0, now he's preventing Reus from galloping into the box with the ball."
50',action,High pressing from Freiburg caused a brief scare at the back for Dortmund as Burki was forced to drill an awkward pass towards Guerreiro and almost presented an opportunity to Petersen.
48',action,"CHANCE! Dortmund start the second half well as Aubameyang peels off his marker and clips a cross into Dembele, but the winger let the ball run underneath his boot as he was unable to control it."
46',action,Dortmund get the second half underway.
,action,"Dortmund have themselves in front in Freiburg, but in truth it could be two or three at the very least. Sokratis opened the scoring from a set-piece, but they could be punished in the second half if they don't score another."
45',action,"CLOSE! Aubameyang races away from the Freiburg defence again and crosses towards Reus in the middle, but despite sliding in an attempt to reach the cross the German just misses out on that touch."
43',action,"Petersen made a fantastic run into the box following a Freiburg counter-attack, but Grifo is unable to find the striker despite his best efforts with a pass using the outside of his foot."
41',action,"It seems as if Freiburg are starting to take the sting out of Dortmund as they knock the ball around the defence a bit more. They're still commanding this match, but Schwolow is currently enjoying an earned break."
39',action,Dembele is screaming in frustration as the ball breaks to the winger on the edge of the box and he opts to clip a chip towards the back post but placed too much power on it.
37',action,"It looks as if since the introduction of Kempf in this match Freiburg have switched to three at the back to try and counter the pressing that Dortmund are offering, but the home side aren't used to playing this system."
35',action,"Philipp and Grifo almost combine well to craft an opportunity for the hosts, but despite the Italian drilling a good pass into his teammate, he's unable to get a shot off on goal."
33',action,"CHANCE! A sea of chances from Dortmund, with Schwolow making an excellent double save and then Guerreiro missing an open goal at the back post. Madness."
31',action,"The pace, tempo and set-up from Dortmund is completely baffling the hosts at the moment. It appears as if they need the half time whistle soon so Streich can speak through with his players for an appoach in the second half."
29',action,"Freiburg are being awful in possession at the back! Aubameyang pinches the play from Gunter and almost clips the ball to Reus at the back post, but Soyuncu is able to rise high and head it away."
27',action,"Dembele cuts inside to his left foot and spots a run from Aubameyang well and almost puts him through on goal, but Schwolow does well again to rush off his line and punch the play away."
25',action,"SAVE! Somehow Freiburg survive another chance as Aubameyang gets behind the defence and shots on goal, but Scholow does well to push the ball away from danger."
24',substitution,; Kempf returns from injury as Streich makes a tacitcal change and brings off Bulut.
23',action,"Dortmund are awarded another free-kick in a similar position to where they scored from. However, this time they're able to deal with it better and Soyuncu was fouled in the area."
21',action,"Freiburg had their first opportunity of the match as a free-kick was a awarded to the hosts about 30 yards from goal, but Grifo's effort on goal from the set-piece was wide and was never going to trouble Burki."
19',action,"CHANCE! Should be 2-0. A fantastic from Castro to find Guerreiro who cuts back to Aubameyang unmarked in the box, but the striker scuffs his shot completely and Freiburg can breathe again."
17',action,Dortmund are finding so much space on the pitch. The away side are knocking the ball around with such ease as the hosts are being forced to chase shadows.
15',action,The goal isn't anything less than Dortmund deserve based on these opening 15 minutes. Streich's side just haven't got going in this match due to their lack of intensity.
13',assist,Assist Raphaël Adelino José Guerreiro ; Guerrerio is given the assist after weighting a ball to the back post brilliantly for Sokratis to attack.
13',goal,Goal Sokratis Papastathopoulos ; GOAL! Sokratis opens the scoring for Dortmund from a well-worked set-piece. The Greek defender escaped his marker and just cushioned a header into the far corner.
11',action,Dortmund are doing really well to press high and maintain a real intensity in this match which is unsettling to home side. If Freiburg want to get in this match they have to take this sting out of Tuchel's team.
9',action,"Freiburg were found caught in possession again as Durm pressed high to pinch the play off Grifo and clipped a cross to the back post, but unfortunately for the midfielder it's just over the head of the striker."
7',action,"It's been a frantic start to this Bundesliga clash, with neither side being able to grasp a firm hold of possession. Both teams are clearly heading into this fixture with an attacking mentality."

3',action,"Freiburg earn the first corner of the match and Grifo whipped the ball into the box towards Petersen, but the forward was unable to flick the cross on from the near post."
1',action,And we're off!
,action,"Just five minutes until kick off! The fans are in the stands, the atmosphere is building and the players are in the tunnel. Not long now."
,action,"Both managers have opted for changes ahead of this match from their respective previous fixtures, but the majority of both teams remain unchanged. Tuchel, who has opted for three has shuffled up the back by introducing Sokratis and Durm, whilst Streich has mixed up the midfield by bringing in Frantz and Bulut to start."
,action,"Subs: Weidenfeller, Schurrle, Pulisic, Kagawa, Merino, Ginter, Schmelzer."
