,action,"Michael Keane was at the centre of the action today as he had a hand (quite literally) in both goals. After a drab first half, Tom Huddlestone opened the scoring for Hull from the penalty spot after Keane deliberately handled in the box. The Burnley defender was to make immediate ammends however, as he netted with a well struck effort just minutes later to level the score. In truth the two teams were evenly matched and often cancelled each other out. The final moment of drama canme in the 92nd minute when Ashley Barnes was sent for an early bath after he was awarded a second yellow card for elbowing Andrea Ranocchia."

59',action,"CLOSE! - Probably Burnley's best chance of the game so far and Andre Gray's first real opportunity.

He's very lucky to escape without a red there. Huddlestone gets a yellow, but no punishment for Boyd!"

,action,The teams are back out on the pictch and we are a bout to get re-started...
,action,"A fairly uneventful first half ends goalless, with neither goalkeeper seriously tested at this juncture. Burnley looked strong in the opening exchanges, and but for a couple of wayward Robbie Brady strikes they may have had more to show for their efforts. Hull have grown back into the game, and Polish winger Kamil Grosicki produced their best effort with a well-taken free-kick that missed by a small margin. Both sides will be looking to be more clinical in the second 45 minutes,"

40',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ashley Westwood ; The first booking of the day goes to Ashley Westwood, who drags down Huddlestone cynically in a very dangerous area. A good chance from the free-kick here for Hull."
38',action,CHANCE - Barton wins a free-kick and delivers the ball deep. Ben Mee connects well but it is straight at Jakupovic. The Hull keeper makes a meal of the catch though and almost drops the ball on the head of Ashley Barnes. The Burnley man cannot direct the ball goalwards and the hosts escape with a warning.
36',action,Maguire heads off to receive further treatment. Hull carry on with ten men and it looks as though Tom Huddlestone will slide in to centre back.
34',action,"Hull City pick up a free-kick after Maloney is tripped by Ashley Westwood. Robertson delivers deep, and Harry Maguire gets a touch but is unable to keep the ball alive. The big defender looks to have twisted his knee as he landed and is down receiving treatment."

30',action,"Both sides have found openings so far, but have lacked a quality end product. You get the feeling there's goals in this game, as Hull's movement has been excellent, but Mbokani is cutting a fryustrated figure out there having had little to feed off yet."
28',action,A minute of applause now for local teacher and Hull CIty fan James Moorfoot who tragically died after he collapsed whilst playing in a match for his local team.
26',action,"Space opens up for Burnley, with Barnes driving his side forward. Huddlestone's challenge halts the progression briefly, but George Boyd collects and picks out Robbie Brady with an inch perfect pass. It's poor from the Irish international though, who loses his head and fires over."

22',action,"CHANCE - Huddlestone shows off his range of passing, as he picks out Elmohamady from distance. The Egyptian knocks the ball onto Mbokani who draws Tom Heaton from the burnley goal. Ben Mee blocks the COngolese striker’s effort and the ball rebounds to Kamil Grosicki who attempts a lob but over-hits his strike. The goal was unguarded!"
19',action,"Hull work the ball around the midfield, keeping Burnley chasing until the space opens up. A lofted pass from Alfred N’Diaye finds Elabdellaoui in space, but his cross is wayward and flies out for a goal-kick."
17',action,"A great bit of play from Boyd, who spins Robertson and delivers a splitting pass through to Gray. The Burnley striker is flagged offside though and the ball is pulled back for a free-kick."
15',action,CLOSE - A fine flowing move from Hull City. Ranocchia picks out Ahmed Elmohamady who races down the line before delivering his cross. Mbokani rises highest but heads narrowly over the crossbar.

7',action,"The history books are on Burnley's side for this clash, as they have not lost to Hull in the last five meetings between the teams. The visitors have set the tone early on, and have Hull pegged back in their own half."
5',action,"A clumsy foul from Andrea Ranocchia, who careers into the back of Barnes to give Burnley a free-kick in the Hull City half. The ball is once again launched forward and headed away by Tom Huddlestone."
3',action,"The ball is ping-ponging around in the early exchanges, with plenty of long balls being played. Joey Barton looks to set Ashley Barnes free on the left side with a lofted pass, but Harry Maguire is across quickly to snuff out the move."
