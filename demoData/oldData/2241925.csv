,action,"That's all from us here at the Stadium of Light, thanks for joining us and we hope you'll be able to join us again soon."
,action,Sunderland secure just their fourth league win of the season as Patrick van Aanholt’s second half goal seals all three points to lift them off the bottom of the Premier League table.
,action,Full-time: Sunderland 1-0 Watford
90'+5',substitution,; A final change for Sunderland to eat away a few more seconds as Fabio Borini is replaced by Wahbi Khazri.
90'+4',action,Watford push numbers forwards but fail to create anything substantial and the pressure is relieved as Deeney slides in recklessly on the edge of the Sunderland area and concedes a foul.
90'+1',action,We’re into five minutes of added time now as Pickford comes out of his six yard box to confidently claim a high Capoue cross. The young goalkeeper has been outstanding so far today!
90',action,Holebas goes for goal from the free-kick but blasts it high over the bar.
89',action,"Referee Madley has pulled play back for handball from Djilobodji just outside the Sunderland box and Watford have a free-kick in a dangerous area, although replays appear to show the ball bounced straight off Deeney’s shoulder."
88',substitution,; Another change for Sunderland as Donald Love is replaced by Sebastian Larsson. It looks as though Denayer will move across to right-back too.
86',action,"Watford just starting to apply the pressure now as Pickford is forced to first block a low shot from Janmaat which came through several bodies inside the penalty area, before getting down smartly to his right to keep out a low 20-yard volley from Ighalo."
84',action,"Superb defending from Djilobodji!! Success finally showing some impressive skill as he skips past Love and drives into the box from the left, but Djilobodji cuts the low cross out really well at the near post."
82',action,"Djilobodji completely takes out the linesman as he looks to prevent the ball going out for a corner, which is greeted by cheers from the home fans as well as a chuckle from the linesman as he gets back to his feet."
81',action,"Capoue swings in a corner from the left and Denayer inexplicably heads the ball straight towards his own goal, however fortunately for him the ball bounces straight into the grateful arms of Pickford."
80',substitution,; A first change for Sunderland now as Adnan Januzaj is given a warm round of applause as he's replaced by John O'Shea.
79',action,"Success looks to drive into the Sunderland box from the left-hand side but ends up simply running the ball out of play for a goal-kick, pretty much summing up the winger’s performance since coming on."
78',substitution,"; Watford are going to make their third and final change now as Kaboul is replaced by former Newcastle man Daryl Janmaat, who is greeted with boos from the home fans."
75',yellow-card,Yellow Card Younes Kaboul ; Januzaj has been a real threat for Sunderland in this second half and he wins a free-kick for a foul by Kaboul. The centre-back receives a yellow card for the foul but Sunderland can’t make the most of the position as van Aanholt crosses straight into Gomes’s arms.
73',action,"Close from Deeney!! Amrabat makes a superb driving run down the right-hand side before chipping a cross in towards Deeney who is unmarked 12 yards out from goal, but the ball is at an awkward height for the Watford captain and he can only attempt a diving header which goes just wide of the right-hand post."
70',action,Gomes just looks as though he might be struggling with an injury here for Watford as he looks in some discomfort whenever he has to take a goal-kick.
68',action,"The game is just beginning to become stretched now as Anichebe looks to break away on the counter attack down the left-hand touchline, but Kabasele recovers to make an outstanding sliding tackle and win the ball back."
65',action,Januzaj whips in a superb cross from a free-kick on the right after a clumsy foul from Success. Kone gets his head to it but it comes off Kaboul last and deflects out for a corner. Sunderland are really upping the tempo now.
63',action,"CLOSE!! Defoe fails to control a low cross with his back to goal, but the ball rolls through to Anichebe on the edge of the penalty area who hits a sweetly struck low shot inches wide of the post with Gomes rooted to the spot!"
62',action,Januzaj pulls away from Behrami superbly well and plays in Defoe down the right once again. This time the striker has no support so looks to cut inside Kaboul on his own but just loses control of the ball and it bounces safely through to Gomes to pick up.
59',action,"Love and Success are both down receiving treatment after a challenge from the Sunderland right-back close to halfway. Watford win a corner from the resultant free-kick and just as they did at the start of the first half, look to pick out Amrabat on the edge of the box, but unlike in the first half his connection on a first-time volley is a poor one and the ball goes high over the bar for a goal-kick."
56',substitution,"; The crowd has come alive since the goal and Walter Mazzarri is making a change in order to try and swing the momentum back his side’s way, as Camilo Zúñiga is replaced by Isaac Success."
54',action,"The ball bounces up to Anichebe on the left-hand corner of the box and the striker hits an ambitious first-time volley towards goal, but it’s always going away from goal and Gomes can comfortably watch it sail wide."
52',action,"Sunderland look like a different side all of a sudden as Anichebe makes a wonderful run down the outside of Kabasele and crosses towards Defoe, but the striker just overruns the ball and Watford survive."
49',goal,"Goal Patrick van Aanholt ; GOOOAAALLLLLLLL!!!!! Van Aanholt puts Sunderland ahead!! Januzaj skips past Kaboul brilliantly in midfield and plays in Defoe down the right-hand edge of the box. The striker is forced out wide but puts in a good low cross, and despite Kabasele’s initial block, van Aanholt reacts well to shoot on the turn and fire the ball in off the post from six yards out."
47',action,"Holebas skips past Ndong with clever footwork before playing a neat one-two with Zuniga, but Ndong tracks back well to tackle the left-back. It’s been a scrappy opening to the second half though."
46',action,Kick-off! Watford get the second half underway.
,action,"David Moyes meanwhile may well look to push Anichebe up alongside Defoe in the second half, as the England striker has looked extremely isolated up against Kaboul for much of the first period, although he will be keen to ensure Sunderland continue to threaten down the left-hand side where Anichebe has linked up well with van Aanholt."
,action,"Walter Mazzarri will undoubtedly be the happier of the two managers, although he will also be somewhat frustrated that his side have not taken the lead after Pickford brilliantly denied Amrabat in the second minute and Britos somehow headed wide from inside the six yard box."
,action,Half-time: Sunderland 0-0 Watford
45'+2',action,Chance for Van Aanholt! The left-back makes a wonderful run forwards into the box and Gomes has to be alert to keep him out at the near post. The flag had stayed down although replays showed van Aanholt to be at least a yard offside!
45'+1',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Valon Behrami ; We’re into two minutes of added time now as Januzaj draws a free-kick from Behrami close to the corner flag for which the Watford midfielder is shown a yellow card, much to the delight of the home fans."
45',action,"Kabasele’s reaction doesn’t appear to have gone down too well with the crowd here at the Stadium of Light, who greet his return to the field with a loud chorus of boos."
44',action,Kabasele goes down holding his face as Anichebe uses his strength to hold the defender off. There was contact from Anichebe’s forearm towards Kabasele’s face but there didn’t appear to be a huge amount in it and the Sunderland striker is understandably frustrated.
41',action,"Defoe looks to put pressure on Kaboul as he rolls the ball back towards Gomes, but the striker is just starting to show some frustration towards his teammates here as he’s pretty isolated at the moment."
38',action,"Zuniga shows good determination to win the ball back from Ndong having lost out to Love on the left hand side, but Ighalo isn’t quite on the same wave length as the winger as he looks to play a through ball and Kone can collect it under no pressure."
36',yellow-card,Yellow Card Adnan Januzaj ; Adnan Januzaj is the first player to go into the book for pulling back Behrami inside the Sunderland half. Watford don’t have much of an angle to work with from the resultant free-kick and Kone is easily able to head the looped delivery clear.
35',action,David Moyes is still remonstrating with the fourth official following what he felt was a dive from Amrabat a few moments ago.
32',action,"Outstanding block from Ndong! Ighalo gets into the box and picks out Zuniga who’s unmarked 12 yards out from goal with seemingly just Pickford to beat, but Ndong slides in and makes a perfectly timed tackle to deny him."
31',substitution,; Sebastian Prödl isn't going to be able to continue following that early knock and he's replaced by Christian Kabasele.
29',action,"Having comfortably saved a Prodl header at one end, Pickford releases Anichebe at the other with a wonderful long kick downfield, and the striker uses his strength to get down the outside of the Watford defence before shooting towards goal from a tight angle, but Kaboul does extremely well to get across and make the block before the shot reaches Gomes’s goal."
28',action,Djilobodji is perhaps lucky to escape with just a talking to from referee Bobby Madley having brought down Ighalo close to halfway. Watford are really starting to dominate this game now.
27',action,"WHAT A MISS!!! Holebas swings in the free-kick towards the back post and Britos and Kaboul get up well, but somehow between them they manage to force the ball wide of the post from just four yards out!"
26',action,Ighalo rolls Denayer superbly well close to the by-line on the right hand side and the Belgian midfielder brings him to ground giving Watford a free-kick in a good position.
23',action,"Amrabat, who’s been quiet so far, gets half a yard of space on the right and whips in a superb low cross towards Ighalo, but Djilobodji has positioned himself well at the near post and sticks out a leg to intercept it."
21',action,"Love picks out Defoe just inside the Watford penalty box and the England striker turns onto his right foot well, but Miguel Britos stays with him to block the shot before Holebas calmly chests the ball back to Gomes."
20',action,"After a slightly frantic start to this game things have settled down a bit in the last ten minutes, with Watford looking the more threatening of the two teams in the final third."
17',action,There’s a break in play as three players are down in the Watford penalty area following a Sunderland corner. Sebastian Prodl is moving with some discomfort but it looks as though he’s going to be able to continue.
15',action,"CLOSE! Jose Holebas finds himself in acres of space on the left hand edge of the penalty area and fires a dangerous cross across the face of goal, but Donald Love just sticks out a toe to divert it past the far post with Ighalo waiting to tap it in on his shoulder."
13',action,"Deeney gets in behind the Sunderland defence down the left with far too much ease for David Moyes’s liking, but his cut-back is well intercepted by Djilobodji with Ighalo lurking behind him."
12',action,Watford win a free-kick in a dangerous position 25 yards out from goal after Didier Ndong hauled Etienne Capoue to ground. Capoue delivers the free-kick into the middle but Lamine Kone gets up well to head it away.
10',action,"Watford have settled into a 3-4-3 formation here which is giving them plenty of options in midfield and they’re seeing more of the ball as a result, but Sunderland, and in particular Patrick van Aanholt, may feel they can expose the lack of fullbacks."
7',action,"This game has started at a really high tempo here, and this time it’s Sunderland who press forwards as Jason Denayer picks out Victor Anichebe just inside the penalty area, but Kaboul stays tight to the striker and gets a good block in, which deflects back off Anichebe and out for a goal-kick."
5',action,Camilo Zuniga looks to break away down the left hand side but he’s well tackled by Donald Love. It’s been a bright start from Watford though.
2',action,"WHAT A SAVE FROM PICKFORD!! Watford this time have a corner which is swung out towards Nordin Amrabat on the edge of the area, and the winger drills a wonderful first-time volley towards the top corner but Jordan Pickford springs high to his right to keep it out!"
1',action,"Sunderland win an early corner after good pressure on Younes Kaboul from Defoe. Defoe takes it short and crosses towards Papy Djilobodji, but he can’t generate enough power on the header to beat Heurelho Gomes."
1',action,Kick-off! Jermain Defoe rolls the ball backwards to get the game underway.
,action,"The players are making their way out onto the pitch, kick-off is not far away now."
,action,"Watford’s Odion Ighalo scored the only goal of the game when the two sides met at the Stadium of Light last season, while it ended in a 2-2 draw in the reverse fixture on the final day of the season after both sides had already secured their Premier League status."
,action,"Watford meanwhile make four changes from their defeat at Manchester City, with Younes Kaboul, Valon Behrami, Camilo Zuniga, and Troy Deeney returning to the side. Daryl Janmaat, Adlene Guedioura, and Jerome Sinclair all drop to the bench while Roberto Pereyra is out injured."
,action,"Having essentially picked seven defenders for the visit of Chelsea, David Moyes makes three changes to his side for today’s game, as Didier Ndong and Donald Love come in alongside Victor Anichebe, who passed a late fitness test. John O’Shea, Billy Jones and Jan Kirchhoff are the men who miss out."

,action,"Watford also go into the game having suffered defeat in midweek, losing 2-0 at Manchester City, however Walter Mazzarri’s side have enjoyed a reasonable season so far, winning six of their 16 games pushing them up to 11th in the table."

,action,"Sunderland sit bottom of the Premier League table having won just three league games this season, however all three of those wins have come since the start of November."
