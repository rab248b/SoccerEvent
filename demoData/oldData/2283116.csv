,action,"FULL-TIME! Real Madrid squeeze to three points at El Sadar, courtesy of second-half goals from Isco and Vazquez. Ronaldo opened the scoring, before Sergio Leon responded in the first half, but Osasuna couldn't quite maintain their performance levels in the opening 45 minutes to gain a share of the spoils. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+3',assist,Assist Marcelo Vieira da Silva Júnior ; Marcelo cuts in from the left-hand side and then releases a neat pass out to the opposite flank.
90'+3',goal,"Goal Lucas Vázquez Iglesias ; GOOOOOOOOAL! VAZQUEZ MAKES IT 3-1! The Spanish substitute manages to tuck home a neat finish, after a lovely ball out wide from Marcelo. The ex-Espanyol man dropped a shoulder, forcing Sirigu to come out, before clipping the ball into the back of the net well."
90'+1',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Goran Čaušić ; Causic picks up a very late booking, as Osasuna try to press and harry to win the ball back."
90',action,"Osasuna whip in a cross from the right-hand side, but Riviere can only dribble a terribly tame effort straight at Navas. He tried his luck with a cheeky flick, but he didn't get anywhere near enough power on it. Real Madrid break down the other end, and Vazquez is denied by plenty of pressure essentially on the goal-line by Oier."
88',substitution,"; Kovacic is introduced into the midfield third, with Isco taking a rest for the last few minutes."
87',action,"Vazquez plays the ball across to the left, with Real Madrid appearing to be much freshers in these late stages. A cross is flighted in towards Ronaldo, but Vujadinovic makes a good headed clearance. Zidane's men are looking more likely to grab the contest's next goal."
85',action,"Osasuna build slowly from the back, as the hosts can't afford to be wasteful with the ball given time left on the clock. Real Madrid rob possession back, with James breaking down the left, but Vazquez then gives the ball away to Loe. The chances are starting to dry up."
83',action,"Good save from Navas! Sergio Leon tries his luck from around 20 yards out, with a stinging effort that takes a slight deflection on its way towards goal. The Costa Rica international gets down smartly to keep Real Madrid's advantage intact."
82',action,"Ronaldo drops a shoulder and shoots with his left foot from the edge of the penalty box, but the Portuguese forward dips a shot a long way beyond the left-hand post. After netting the opener, the experienced striker can't seem to find the back of the net."
80',action,"Real Madrid are starting to dominate the ball quite nicely in the last 10 minutes, with Osasuna forced to sit back quite deep inside their own half. After a bright start to the second half, the hosts have petered out slightly and appear to have run out of steam."
78',action,"Ronaldo wants a penalty! Vazquez races down the right and pulls back a cross, with David Garcia then appearing to impede Ronaldo slightly. The Portugal international goes down, with Sirigu pouncing on the loose ball, but the referee isn't interested."
77',action,"Real Madrid slow things down with patient possession in the dying stages, as Zidane's men try to ensure that a late come-back isn't an option. Los Blancos shift the ball from flank to flank, carefully making sure that Osasuna can't counter with ease."
75',action,"Ronaldo is released into the penalty area and tries to shoot from a tight angle, but Sirigu makes a smart save with his outstretched leg. Real Madrid take the corner from the right-hand side, and Ramos meets the ball with his head at the back post, but the Spaniard can't hit the target."
73',action,"Jaime bursts down the right-hand side and tries to whip a cross in from out wide, but Navas is able to come off his line and gather up the ball ahead of Sergio Leon. The Osasuna winger goes down with an injury and the physios are immediately called on."
72',substitution,; Vazquez replaces Benzema for the last 20 minutes or so.
70',action,"Clerc cuts in from the left and beats Isco, but then a pass infield to Sergio Leon sees the Osasuna goalscorer miscontrol badly. Vasiljevic's men can't afford to be wasteful in their build-up play, as we head into the last 20 minutes at El Sadar. Ronaldo is once again aimed for by a long throughball, but Sirigu makes a simple catch."
68',action,"Osasuna whip in a cross from the right-hand side, which sees Varane slice a clearance back to Navas. The hosts claim for a passback, but that was entirely accidental. Ronaldo is the target of a ball in behind the back four, but the Portugal international is caught offside."
66',action,"Berenguer races down the left, with the ball eventually worked out to Jaime on the right-hand side. Osasuna give the ball away, with James then breaking away for the visitors. Now they have their goal, however, Los Blancos are prepared to be much more patient."

Benzema is found out on the right-hand side by a wonderful pass from Casemiro, with the Frenchman then running into traffic.

61',substitution,"; Loe is introduced into the game for the last half an hour, with Fausto taking his leave after working incredibly hard."
59',action,"Jaime shoots from long range, but the Osasuna wide man can only blast horrendously over the crossbar. Real Madrid respond with a counter-attack, but the away side are slowed and Berenguer eventually makes a good interception on the left flank."
57',substitution,"; James is introduced into the game, with Danilo taken off in some pain. It looked like a twisted ankle. That will see the Colombia international slot into the midfield, with Real Madrid altering their system slightly."
56',action,"The stretcher is needed for Danilo, with the former Porto right-back going down heavily. The Brazilian was accidentally trodden upon, with the physios on the pitch immediately. Carvajal and Vazquez are sent out to warm up."
55',action,"Marcelo escapes down the left-hand side and feeds a forward pass into Ronaldo's path, but Sirigu is alert to the danger and races out to smother the loose ball. Real Madrid haven't quite got the cutting edge required to cause real problems in the final third. Danilo goes down with an injury, after a heavy tackle from David Garcia."
53',substitution,"; Clerc comes into the game at left-back, with Fuentes jogging off."
52',action,"Real Madrid carefully build from the back, with Marcelo found out on the left.

Moments later, Fuentes makes a great interception at the back post to deny Ronaldo."
50',action,"Osasuna have been able to keep up a reasonable amount of pressure this evening, with Sergio Leon pulling all of the strings. Vasiljevic will be hoping for another goal from his key man to tip the balance. Zidane's men certainly can't afford to relax."
48',action,"Navas makes a great save, diving low to his right to tip a ball around the post. Sergio Leon wriggles infield from the right, getting away from Ramos, but his effort is denied. The Osasuna goalscorer is proving to be a real menace."
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half at El Sadar! Sergio Leon currently has Los Rojillos on their way to a much-needed result, but Real Madrid will certainly look to kick on after the break. Zidane might have to weigh up a change of formation."
,action,"HALF-TIME! Osasuna currently have their hands on a point, but they will need to keep impressing to keep Real Madrid at bay. Sergio Leon's equaliser, following Ronaldo's opener, has the hosts in a rather positive position. The only negative was Bonnin's horrible injury. Zidane has plenty to think about."
45'+1',action,There are two minutes of first-half stoppage time due to Bonnin's injury.
45',action,"Isco cuts inside from the left and shoots with his right foot, but the Spain international can only fire straight at Sirigu. The hosts counter, but Riviere is tackled well right on the periphery of the Real Madrid box. Zidane's men just can't seem to keep the Basque underdogs at bay."
43',action,"Ronaldo is teed up on the edge of the penalty area, but the ex-Manchester United forward fires a first-time shot a long way wide of the right-hand upright.

41',action,"Ronaldo tries to flick a lofted ball into Benzema's path, but the Portuguese striker misjudges the flight of the pass and Sirigu collects. Osasuna threaten down the right, with Sergio Leon jinking his way beyond Marcelo - but Isco recovers to make a necessary challenge."

38',action,"Marcelo is found overlapping down the left-hand side, and picks out Benzema at the back post. The France international rises well and nods a header square across goal, but Ronaldo can't react quickly enough to get on the end of it. Chances are flowing in the Basque country."
37',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Fausto Antonio Tienza Nuñez ; Fausto picks up a yellow card for a late, untidy tackle on Sergio Ramos."
37',action,"Marcelo cuts back a cross from the left byline, but his ball is intercepted easily. Osasuna counter down the left through Berenguer, but a cross is deflected behind for a corner - that again comes to nothing. Less than 10 minutes remain until the interval, and this game is far more open than Real Madrid would like."
35',action,"Benzema and Ronaldo play a one-two on the edge of the box, but a return pass into the Portuguese forward is misplaced. Osasuna suddenly have their tails up. Navas is almost caught off his line, as Fausto shoots from 40 yards out, but the Real Madrid shot-stopper recovers well. The visitors counter, and Sirigu is forced into a phenomenal save to deny Benzema!"
33',assist,"Assist Juan Rafael Fuentes Hernández ; Fuentes plays a hopeful ball over the top, which turns into a great pass."

28',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Luka Modrić ; Jaime tries to flick a header into Riviere's path, but the Frenchman is beaten aerially by Ramos. Modric then picks up a booking, as the Croatian midfielder holds off Berenguer with a raised arm, as Osasuna tried to develop their break further."
26',action,"Osasuna respond with a foray down the left-hand side, but Fuentes eventually whips in a cross from which Ramos easily heads clear. Moments later, Oier tries to whip in a delivery from deep on the opposite flank, but it fails to beat the first man. Zidane will be pleased with how his side are protecting their 18-yard box at the moment."
24',assist,"Assist Karim Benzema ; Benzema has plenty of time to slide a throughball into the area, and Ronaldo does the rest."
24',goal,"Goal Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro ; GOOOOOOOAL! RONALDO MAKES IT 1-0! The Portugal international is fed into the penalty area nicely, before directing a low shot across goal and into the bottom-left corner!

Fouls are breaking up the flow of play in this first half."

Moments later, Nacho is penalised for bringing down Jaime."
18',action,"Causic takes aim from outside of the penalty box, but the Serbian midfielder's shot takes a quite wicked deflection. It doesn't throw Navas off, however, with the ex-Levante shot-stopper making a simply save. Osasuna have done quite well in these opening stages, and have limited Real Madrid to barely any opportunities of their own."
16',action,"Riviere tries an audacious over-head kick from the edge of the penalty area, but Navas gathers the ball up without a problem. Real Madrid respond with a long ball forward that searches for Ronaldo, but Vujadinovic heads away with ease. Clear-cut chances are proving hard to come by."
15',substitution,"; There is a long break in play, with Bonnin replaced immediately by David Garcia in defence. Bonnin will be out injured for a long while, it seems, and his teammates look distraught."
14',action,"Bonnin is tackled badly by Isco, with the Osasuna defender going down injured immediately. It appears that the hosts' right-back landed very badly, and it appears to be a fracture. That doesn't look good at all, and the stretcher is brought on straight away."

The hosts maintain their pressure with a dipping cross threatening Navas' left-hand post, but Danilo clears behind for a corner - which comes to nothing for Los Rojillos."

The home side respond with Berenguer threatening from out wide, but a cross from the Spaniard is deflected away by Navas."
7',action,"Zidane's men continue to dominate the opening stages, but this time a venture forward from Los Blancos results in Ronaldo overcooking a throughball. Osasuna respond with an attack of their own, with Sergio Leon fed in behind, but Varane covers across easily to outmuscle the hosts' top league goalscorer. Neither goalkeeper has been tested in this contest."
5',action,"Benzema tries to burst down the left-hand side, but the Frenchman is denied by Oier. The away side are enjoying all of the early possession, with the ex-Lyon striker dribbling into the penalty area once again to no avail. Moments later, the France international is involved once again and shoots just wide of the side netting. Sirigu wasn't worried at all."
3',action,"Sergio Leon opens the ball out to the left-hand side, but a cross from Jaime is gathered up by Navas ahead of Riviere. Despite Real Madrid using wing-backs to offer extra defensive cover on the flanks, the hosts managed to get in behind fairly easily there. Osasuna aren't willing to take any risks early on."
