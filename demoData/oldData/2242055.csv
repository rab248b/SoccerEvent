,action,"A few boos ring around the stadium as the referee blows his whistle for the final time. It's certainly been a frustrating afternoon for United, who dominated possession but, no matter how hard they tried, just couldn't find any joy in front of goal. West Brom defended heroically to keep the home side at bay, with Nyom, Evans, McAuley and Dawson all performing brilliantly throughout."
,action,FULL-TIME: MANCHESTER UNITED 0-0 WEST BROMWICH ALBION
90'+5',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Claudio Ariel Yacob ; Meanwhile, Yacob has also been booked for his part in the fracas. That should be that for West Brom, however."
90'+5',yellow-card,Yellow Card Wayne Rooney ; Rooney has also been shown a yellow card for screaming at the referee.
90'+5',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Marouane Fellaini-Bakkioui ; Fellaini, who also clashed with Yacob, is shown a yellow card for what looked to be a slight headbutt on the Argentine."
90'+4',action,"It's kicking off in the middle of the pitch! Yacob and Rooney clash in the middle of the pitch as the Argentine tries to hold on to possession on the halfway line. The captain looks incredibly angry at not being able to break down West Brom on what has been a frustrating afternoon, and the referee doesn't look at all happy with his behaviour."
90'+2',action,"Ball after ball is being flung into the West Brom penalty area, but the visitors are doing incredibly well to deal with each and every one of them. They're now just two minutes away from leaving Old Trafford with a very well-earned point."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be four minutes of added time.
88',action,"What a save from Foster! Rashford steps up and fires a wonderful shot that looks set to find the top left-hand corner of the net, but Foster dives acrobatically to his right before tipping the ball over the top of the crossbar."
87',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Jake Livermore ; Ouch! Livermore flies into Young and catches the full-back with a late challenge, resulting in a yellow card for the midfielder and a free-kick to United in a great position. Can the home side make it count?"
86',action,"Fletcher hits the crossbar! The midfielder finds himself in a pocket of space 25 yards away from goal and immediately unleashes a thumping strike. It should be easily caught by De Gea but the goalkeeper somehow fumbles it on to the crossbar. Luckily for him, he's then able to smother the ball before it can bounce over the line."
84',action,"Almost a lovely pass from Rooney! The number 10 chips a delightful ball over the West Brom defence and through to Rashford, but just as it looks as if it's going to reach the striker, McAuley sticks out a high boot to stop it from doing so."
82',action,"Rashford goes close again! The striker skips past Morrison just outside of the West Brom penalty area before unleashing another dangerous shot, but this time it fails to hit the target and bounces a few yards wide of the far post."
80',action,"Nervy moments for Nyom! The defender tangles with Lingard and brings the United man crashing to the ground, resulting in a free-kick for the home side. The home players and fans all scream for a second yellow card, but the referee decides to just give the full-back a talking to."
78',action,"West Brom enjoy a rare spell of possession as they move the ball around nicely inside the United half of the pitch. They're unable to make it count, however, as the hosts are easily able to deal with the danger before pushing forward once again."
76',action,"Almost an own-goal by Evans! Young flies into the left-hand side of the West Brom box on a beautiful run before trying to cut a pass back to a team-mate, but Evans is just about able to get a foot on the ball. He inadvertently almost sends it into the back of his own net, however, but, luckily for the defender, it ends up flying into the side-netting."
74',substitution,; Wayne Rooney receives a rousing round of applause from the United fans as he comes on to replace Mkhitaryan for the final quarter of an hour.
73',action,"Excellent defending by Rojo! Rondon is presented with a great chance to fire in what would be a big goal completely against the run of play, but he holds on to it for far too long inside the penalty area and loses out to Rojo at the near post."
72',action,"Great stop by Foster! Rashford does well to get himself into a pocket of space just outside of the penalty area and immediately unleashes a great strike that looks set for the top right-hand corner of the net, but, somehow, Foster is able to parry it away with an excellent diving save."
70',substitution,"; Robson-Kanu slowly makes his way off the pitch to be replaced by Salomon Rondon, who has surely been instructed to hold up the ball whenever it comes his way."
69',action,"Another United attacking move fails to come to anything, allowing West Brom to push forward on a rare attacking move. Brunt and Robson-Kanu initially link up well over on the left wing, but the latter is closed down by Bailly and loses out to the centre-back."
68',substitution,"; West Brom have made an understandably defensive switch, with Claudio Yacob coming on to take the place of Chadli."
67',action,"What an opportunity for Mkhitaryan! The Armenian breaks into the West Brom penalty area and immediately tries to dink a deft chip over the on-rushing Foster, but the goalkeeper manages to get a left hand on the ball to stop it from finding the back of the net."
65',action,"Another dangerous cross is fired into the penalty area, this time from Young. However, once again it's just about dealt with by West Brom, as Nyom gets a foot on the ball to stop it from finding Rashford in front of goal."
63',action,"Lingard twists and turns over on the left-hand side of the West Brom before chipping a cross over to the far post, but Brunt is there to beat Martial to the ball before heading it out for a corner that the visitors easily deal with."
61',action,"Nyom commits another clumsy foul, resulting in a free-kick for United. It's sent short to Young, who then fires a pass down the left wing and towards Martial, but it's completely overhit and rolls harmlessly out of play for a goal-kick."
59',action,"Lingard does well to break into the right-hand side of the West Brom penalty area before taking on Evans, but the winger is slightly heavy-handed in his dealing with the centre-back and ends up giving away a foul."
57',substitution,"; West Brom have made their first substitution of the afternoon, with McClean making way for Morrison."
56',action,"Thumping strike by Martial! United keep pushing forward before Martial unleashes a rocket of a strike from 25 yards out, but it flies just wide of the far post after beating the outstretched limbs of Foster."
55',action,"What an opportunity for Fellaini! Mkhitaryan latches onto a pass from Lingard in front of goal and quickly shoots, but McClean is there to throw his body in the way of the effort. It rolls back to Fellaini, who then fires a follow-up strike, but it's poorly hit and fails to hit the target."
54',action,"Martial gets himself into a good position deep down the left flank and quickly tries to tee up Rashford with a low cross, but, not for the first time this afternoon, McAuley is there to blast the ball away from danger with a vital interception."
52',action,"Poor from Martial! The Frenchman breaks down the right flank and easily beats McClean before curling a cross-cum-shot over to the far post, but it's completely overhit and ends up sailing well wide of the goal."
51',action,"Big opportunity for Darren Fletcher! The former United midfielder is left all alone inside the penalty area and can easily get a shot away, but it's hit with the wrong foot and is quickly closed down before it can test De Gea."
50',action,"Almost a costly mistake by Nyom! The defender initially does well to dispossess Valencia deep down the right flank, but he fires the ball straight to Rashford. The youngster twists and turns before finally shooting, but his effort is well blocked by Evans."
48',action,"What a tackle by Dawson! Mkhitaryan and Martial play a lovely one-two between themselves on the edge of the West Brom before the latter darts towards the near post, but Dawson is there to dispossess the Frenchman just as he's about to shoot."
47',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Allan Romeo Nyom ; Nyom quickly earns himself a yellow card for a late challenge on Carrick, who was brought crashing to the ground by the Cameroon international's outstretched leg."
46',action,We're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"It's been a frustrating day for United so far, but West Brom will certainly be pleased with how things are panning out. They've sat deep and defended really well to frustrate the hosts, who, despite enjoying 75% of possession, have done very little with the ball in front of goal. Foster has rarely been troubled, and that's largely down to strong defending from McAuley and Evans in the centre."
,action,HALF-TIME: MANCHESTER UNITED 0-0 WEST BROMWICH ALBION
45'+1',action,"United push forward on one last attack before the half-time, but they're unable to do so quickly enough and the referee blows his whistle as another misplaced pass fails to find a red shirt."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be just one minute of added time.
44',action,"Martial drives down the left wing on a promising run before cutting inside and teeing up Lingard just outside of the West Brom box, but the latter's first touch is poor and sends the ball straight into the feet of Brunt, who then clears."
43',action,Brunt's cross into the United penalty area from the resulting free-kick is a good one but Fellaini does well to get a foot on the ball to stop it from reaching any of the West Brom players in front of goal.
42',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Faustino Marcos Alberto Rojo ; Another United attacking move comes to an end and allows Robson-Kanu to break away on a quick counter-attack. He charges down the left wing and takes on Rojo, who cynically barges the forward to the floor and picks up a yellow card as a result."
40',action,"James McClean pushes forward on his first attack of the afternoon before being clumsy challenged by Bailly deep down the left wing. The resulting free-kick is whipped into the penalty and towards McAuley, but De Gea is there to cut out the danger with a strong catch."
38',action,"Fellaini muscles his way into the West Brom box before unleashing a shot that deflects over to Martial. The Frenchman then takes a shot himself, but McAuley dives in front of the effort to stop it from testing Foster."
37',action,"United are continuing to boss possession inside the West Brom half of the pitch, but they're really struggling to do much with it. The visitors have remained resolute and well-organised so far, with the back four proving to be incredibly hard to beat."
35',action,"United patiently pass the ball around inside the West Brom half of the pitch before Mkhitaryan tries to fire a through-ball into the penalty area and towards Rashford, but it's overhit by the Armenian and rolls straight into the hands of Foster at the near post."
33',action,"No, they can't. Chris Brunt steps up and unleashes a rocket of a shot, but the wall stands firm and deflects the midfielder's strike away from goal and out for a throw-in on the right wing."
32',action,"Robson-Kanu is bundled over by Marcos Rojo 10 or so yards outside of the United penalty area, resulting in a free-kick for West Brom in a very dangerous position. It looks as if they're going to shoot from the set-piece, but can they make it count?"
30',action,"What a chance for Martial! United keep pushing forward before Valencia curls a beautiful cross right on to the head of Martial, but the forward's effort on goal ends up flying just wide of the near post. That was certainly the best chance of the game so far."
28',action,"A deep cross from Antonio Valencia flies over to the far post and finds Fellaini, who does well to keep the ball in play. The Belgian immediately nods it across the face of goal and towards Martial, but, despite his best efforts, the Frenchman is unable to make contact with it."
26',action,"Big chance for United! Carrick slips a clever pass into the penalty area and over to Lingard, who then fires a low cross towards the six-yard box. It's brilliantly hit and should be converted, but there's nobody there to meet it, much to the annoyance of Jose Mourinho on the touchline."
24',action,"Lingard and Nyom have been involved in a good battle down the right wing, and it's one that, so far, the West Brom defender is winning. Lingard doesn't look happy at a tackle on him from the Cameroonian full-back, but the referee isn't at all interested in his protests and waves play on."
22',action,"Young and Henrikh Mkhitaryan link up well deep down the left flank before the full-back tries to break into the West Brom penalty area, but he slightly overruns the ball and ends up conceding a goal-kick before he can fire a cross towards Rashford."
20',action,"Martial cuts inside from the left wing on another good run before unleashing a shot from the edge of the penalty area that's deflected out for a corner. The set-piece initially fails to result in a chance on goal before Ashley Young curls a cross back into the box, but, once again, Evans is there to cut out the danger."
18',action,"United come back once again through Rashford, who is tripped over by Chadli and wins the hosts a free-kick. It's taken quickly and sent down to Martial, who then tees up Fellaini, but the Belgian ends up accidentally handling the ball inside the penalty area before he can shoot."
16',action,Rashford muscles his way into the left-hand side of the West Brom box before spinning and whipping a cross towards Martial. It looks set to find the Frenchman in front of goal but Jonny Evans is there to head it away from danger at the vital moment.
14',action,"West Brom are unable to fully clear the danger from their own penalty area, allowing Michael Carrick to chip a cross over to the far post. Martial rises high and beats McAuley to the ball, but he fouls the centre-back whilst doing so and gives away a free-kick."
13',action,"Allan Nyom picks up the ball in a promising position midway down the left wing and quickly cuts inside before curling a cross over to Robson-Kanu. It's completely overhit, however, and sails comfortably into the hands of De Gea."
11',action,"Chance for Jesse Lingard! A deflected pass from Anthony Martial bounces off the leg of Nacer Chadli and over to Lingard. The winger is in a pocket of space over on the right-hand side of the box and quickly shoots, but it fails to test Ben Foster and instead flies a few yards over the top of the crossbar."
9',action,"An attempted West Brom attack comes to an end and allows United to break forward quickly. Another lofted pass is fired through the middle of the pitch and towards Rashford, but the youngster is unable to get the better of Gareth McAuley and loses out to the veteran defender."
7',action,"Hal Robson-Kanu is fouled by Eric Bailly just inside the United half of the pitch and wins West Brom their first free-kick of the afternoon. They're unable to make it count, however, as the ball is wastefully fired into the box and straight to David De Gea."
5',action,"Marouane Fellaini charges through the middle of the pitch before setting up Rashford just outside of the West Brom penalty area. The youngster takes a quick touch and then tries to spin round his marker, but he's quickly closed down by a group of defenders and is almost immediately dispossessed."
3',action,"United patiently pass the ball around on the halfway line before Michael Carrick launches a lofted pass over to the left wing. Marcus Rashford chases it down and puts Craig Dawson under pressure near to the corner flag, but the right-back is easily able to shepherd the ball out for a throw-in."

,action,"Jose Mourinho has decided to make three changes to the United side that started the win away to Middlesbrough before the international break, with Marcos Rojo, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Anthony Martial coming into the starting line-up to replace Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Juan Mata, the latter of whom is out injured. There are also places on the substitutes' bench for youngsters Matthew Willock and Axel Tuanzebe."

,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"December’s meeting at the Hawthorns ended in a 2-0 win for United - courtesy of an Ibrahimovic double - but West Brom have enjoyed visits to Old Trafford in recent years. They’ve left with victories on two of the previous three occasions, whilst last season’s game in the West Midlands also saw Tony Pulis’ men leave with three well-earned points."
,action,"After reaching their 40-point target with a win over Bournemouth, West Brom seemed to take their foot off the pedal in their following two games, resulting in disappointing defeats against Crystal Palace and Everton. They bounced back in fine fashion, however, by piling more pressure on Arsene Wenger with a 3-1 victory at home to Arsenal before the international break, and they’ll be looking to cause problems for another top four chaser here today."
,action,"The suspension handed to Zlatan Ibrahimovic initially looked as if it would cause serious problems for a United side that have relied heavily on the Swedish striker’s goals this season. They’ve managed to deal with his absence well, however, but today’s game against a strong West Brom team could prove to be a big test for Marcus Rashford and co."
,action,"With three wins from their last four Premier League games heading into this afternoon’s clash, United are on course to remain on the heels of Manchester City if they’re able to leave with another positive result here this afternoon. The Red Devils haven’t tasted defeat in the league since October 23rd, and, with two games still in hand after this weekend, are on course to finish in the top four if they’re able to keep this good form going."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Premier League game between Manchester United and West Bromwich Albion at Old Trafford.
