,action,"It’s all over at the Stadio San Paolo and Napoli have come from behind the win the game on the night, but it’s Juventus who progress to their third consecutive Coppa Italia final with a 5-4 aggregate win, thanks to a 3-1 first leg win and a brace of away goals for Gonzalo Higuain today. That’s all from us for today folks, thanks for joining us and we hope you can join us again soon."
,action,Full-time: Napoli 3-2 Juventus
90'+4',action,"Napoli are still seeing plenty of the ball but you sense that they feel their chance has gone, as Diawara wastes a good position on the edge of the Juventus penalty area by blasting the ball into the stands."
90'+2',action,"Cuadrado is down clutching his leg with what looks to be cramp allowing Massimiliano Allegri time to give some instructions to Dani Alves, although the Brazilian doesn’t look as though he fully understands what he’s being told."
90'+1',action,"The fourth official’s board goes up to signal six minutes of added time, which is greeted by a huge cheer from the home fans, who still believe their side can score twice."
89',action,CLOSE!!! Napoli come close to setting up a dramatic finish as Pavoletti’s shot on the turn from just inside the Juventus penalty area is deflected narrowly over the bar! That may well be that for Napoli who still need another two goals to progress to the final.
88',yellow-card,Yellow Card Daniel Alves da Silva ; This game is becoming extremely scrappy now as Dani Alves becomes the latest player to go into the book for a late tackle on Allan.
86',substitution,"; Juventus are making their third change now with Mario Lemina coming on in place of Sturaro, who unsurprisingly is in no rush to get across to the other side of the field to go off."
85',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Miralem Pjanić ; Another yellow card for Juventus, this time for Pjanic for a cynical trip on Callejon 35 yards out from goal, but the free-kick comes to nothing as Juventus comfortably head it clear."
84',action,"A lovely back-heel from Insigne sets Callejon away in space down the right-hand side, but his low cross isn’t a particularly good one and is easily intercepted by Barzagli."
82',substitution,; Napoli are making their third and final substitution with Allan coming on in place of Zielinski in midfield.
80',yellow-card,Yellow Card Faouzi Ghoulam ; Ghoulam goes in late on Cuadrado and is subsequently shown a yellow card. That wasn’t particularly smart from the Napoli left-back as it will give Juventus another chance to take more time out of the game.
79',action,Juventus are doing their best to take time out of this game now as Pjanic takes an age to get back to his feet after what was a pretty innocuous challenge from Mertens.
77',action,"Nearly another horrendous mistake from Neto as he scuffs his clearance straight into Pavoletti, but fortunately for the Juventus keeper the ball bounces off the substitute and straight out for a goal kick. That really could have gone anywhere though."
76',substitution,"; Juventus are also making a change, and Dybala is taking his time making his way off the field to be replaced by Andrea Barzagli."
75',yellow-card,Yellow Card Nikola Maksimović ; Yellow card Nikola Maksimović
75',substitution,"; Another change for Napoli now as they go in search of the two goals they need, with Hamsik going off to be replaced by Leonardo Pavoletti."
74',action,"Hamsik attempts an early cross towards Callejon at the back post which is well intercepted by Benatia, but the danger is not gone for Juventus as Hysaj skips past a couple of defenders on the right before getting a cross away towards Mertens, but he’s unable to get enough height on the delivery to pick out the substitute and Juventus this time do clear."
72',action,"Juventus now look as though they’re panicking slightly on the ball and are really struggling to get out of their own half, as Hamsik’s tackle on Dani Alves is greeted by a loud cheer from the home fans."
70',substitution,; A change for Juventus now as they look to see out the remaining minutes of this match with Miralem Pjanic coming on for Rincon who has picked up a knock.
67',assist,"Assist José María Callejón Bueno ; Callejón showed some superb footwork to create the space for Insigne, who had the simple task of firing the ball home."
67',goal,"Goal Lorenzo Insigne ; GOOOOOOAAAALLLLLL!!!! Napoli take the lead on the night!!! Callejon skips past Alex Sandro with a lovely piece of skill inside the Juventus penalty box before cutting the ball back to an unmarked Insigne, who sweeps the ball past Neto from just outside the six yard box to give Napoli a glimmer of hope."
65',yellow-card,Yellow Card Amadou Diawara ; Diawara goes into the referee’s book for a somewhat rash challenge on Dybala close to halfway.
63',action,"Higuaín’s second goal had gone some way to silencing this Napoli crowd, but that Mertens goal has given them renewed energy, despite the fact their side still need another three goals."
61',goal,"Goal Dries Mertens ; GOOOOAAAALLLLLL!!!! Mertens has only been on the pitch for a matter of second but he draws Napoli level as Neto allows a simple throw-in to roll straight under his foot, and the substitute reacts quickly to tap the ball home into an empty net."
61',substitution,; Substitution Arkadiusz Milik Dries Mertens
58',assist,Assist Juan Guillermo Cuadrado Bello ; Cuadrado could easily have gone for goal himself there but opted to set up Higuain instead.
58',goal,"Goal Gonzalo Gerardo Higuaín ; GOOOOAAAAALLLL!!!! Higuain restores Juventus’s lead!! Dybala picks out Cuadrado in acres of space inside the right-hand side of the Napoli penalty box, and the winger unselfishly chooses not to go for goal and instead pulls the ball back towards Higuain, who drills it into the roof of the net from 12 yards out."
57',action,"Napoli look extremely dangerous now as Hamsik shifts the ball onto his left-foot on the left-hand corner of the penalty box and goes for goal himself, but the shot is pulled horribly and almost turns into a useful cross for Milik in the middle, but the ball has too much pace for the striker and Juventus survive."
55',action,Unsurprisingly that goal has given the Napoli players and fans a huge lift and the noise levels inside the stadium have increased dramatically. Juventus look pretty unsettled too just at the minute.
53',goal,"Goal Marek Hamšík ; GOOOOOAAAALLLLLL!!!! Hamsik pulls Napoli level! Insigne shows some clever footwork on the edge of the box and looks to play the ball into the feet of Callejon, and although Alex Sandro sticks a toe in to divert the ball away from the winger, he can only knock it straight to Hamsik who fires the ball into the bottom corner from just inside the area."
50',action,"Juventus are sitting extremely deep and allowing Napoli to have possession inside the Juventus half, but the tactic seems to be working as Napoli fail to find a way of getting the ball into a dangerous area before Chiriches loses patience and blasts the ball high over the bar from 35 yards out."
48',action,"Close!! Diawara steals the ball away from Rincon and rolls it into Milik who decides to go for goal from close to 30 yards out, but despite catching it well he can’t quite direct the effort on target, and it flies narrowly wide of Neto’s goal."
47',action,"Napoli are seeing plenty of the ball early on in this second half, but play has been stopped by the referee as Rincon is down having taken a bang to the face. He’s clutching his nose but the medical staff haven’t come onto the field so he’s going to be allowed to continue without going off."
46',action,Kick-off! Referee Luca Banti blows his whistle and Juventus get the second half underway.
,action,"Maurizio Sarri will know his side have very little to lose in the second half, and he may well add an extra attacking option from the bench before too much longer, while Juventus will be content to control the game without too much attacking intent as they did in the closing stages of the first half."
,action,"Juventus lead by a single goal at the Stadio San Paolo thanks to Higuaín’s low 25-yard strike, meaning Napoli will have to score three second half goals without conceding in order to take the game to extra time. They have had their chances though, particularly early on when Callejon was brilliantly denied by Neto from just five yards out."
,action,Half-time: Napoli 0-1 Juventus
45'+2',action,We’re into two minutes of added time at the end of the first half as Koulibaly heads Diawara’s free-kick over the bar from 10 yards out. That was a reasonable chance for Napoli and the centre-back will be disappointed not to have hit the target.
45',action,Juventus don’t look in any real hurry to add to their lead before the break now as Khedira rolls the ball back towards his own centre-halves rather than playing the ball wide to Alex Sandro in a more forward position.
43',action,"Another good move from Napoli as Callejon gets to the byline on the left-hand side and stands up a cross towards Milik in the middle, but the ball is fractionally too high for the striker and Juventus are able to clear the ball away."
41',action,"Neto picks out Alex Sandro with a lovely drilled pass from deep inside his own penalty box, but the left-back can’t control the pass as he looks to break forward down the touchline and Napoli will have the throw-in. You sense one or two of their fans are just starting to get a little frustrated now though."
39',action,"A half chance for Napoli as Zielinski chips a lovely delicate ball over the top of the Juventus defence for Hamsik to get on the end of just inside the left-hand edge of the penalty box, but he attempts an ambitious first-time volley and slices it horribly wide, when he may have been better bringing the ball under control and looking to pick out Callejon in the middle."
36',action,"Juventus are essentially playing a 4-4-2 when Napoli have the ball now, allowing Dybala and Higuain to really press up on the Napoli defence, not giving them any time to pick out a forward pass."
34',action,"That goal has taken all of the intensity out of this game, with Napoli now needing three goals without reply just to take the game to extra time."
32',assist,"Assist Stefano Sturaro ; There didn't appear to be much danger when Sturaro played the ball into Higuain, but the ball found its way past Reina nonetheless."
32',goal,"Goal Gonzalo Gerardo Higuaín ; GOOOOAAALLLLLL!!! Moments after Rincon had blasted a golden opportunity over the bar from 12 yards out, Higuain does give Juventus the lead as he knocks the ball out of his feet and fires it into the bottom corner from 25 yards out. Reina may well be a little disappointed with that as it wasn't an especially powerful shot."
30',yellow-card,Yellow Card Juan Guillermo Cuadrado Bello ; Callejon is now shown a yellow card for frantically gesturing to the referee that he should show Cuadrado a yellow card for the dive.
30',action,Things are getting pretty heated now as both players come together on the edge of the Napoli penalty box following what appeared to be a dive from Cuadrado.
30',yellow-card,Yellow Card José María Callejón Bueno ; Yellow card José María Callejón Bueno
28',yellow-card,Yellow Card Kalidou Koulibaly ; Koulibaly is shown a yellow card for the foul.
27',action,Massimiliano Allegri is engaged in a rather heated disagreement with the fourth official at the moment as his side are awarded a free-kick 35 yards out from goal on the right-hand side following a foul on Juan Cuadrado by Koulibaly.
25',yellow-card,Yellow Card Tomás Eduardo Rincón Hernández ; Rincon receives the first yellow card of the game for a late tackle on Koulibaly. That wasn’t the first foul by the Juventus midfielder either.
24',action,"Juventus are playing with 10 men behind the ball for the majority of the time that Napoli are in possession at the moment, with only Higuain up field, and so far their shape is remaining solid and Napoli are struggling to find a way through."
22',action,"Very nearly a disaster at the back for Napoli as Hamsik gives the ball away cheaply to Dybala 30 yards out from his own goal and the Juventus forward plays it into the path of Higuain inside the penalty box, but the flag goes up for offside against the Argentine striker, although his shot is blocked by Reina anyway."
20',action,"Stefano Sturaro half-heartedly appeals for a penalty as he goes to ground under a challenge from Elseid Hysaj close to the penalty spot, but he went down far too easily in truth and the referee ignores his calls."
18',action,The Napoli fans are certainly making themselves heard as several crunching tackles go in from both sides within the space of a minute. Referee Banti could well have a busy game ahead of him if the opening few minutes are anything to go by.
16',action,"Napoli are beginning to control this game after a bright opening five minutes from Juventus as Amadou Diawara hits a well-struck effort towards goal from 25 yards out, but it’s straight at Neto who gathers it in with ease."
14',action,"Higuain is brought to ground by Vlad Chriches inside the Juventus half the referee awards a free-kick, which isn’t a hugely popular decision with the home fans or the Napoli manager Maurizio Sarri."
12',action,"WHAT A CHANCE!! Huge chance for Napoli as Milik plays in Insigne down the left-hand side of the penalty box with a clever back-heel and the winger slides the ball across the face of goal where Jose Callejon appears to have the simple task of tapping it home from five yards out, but Neto does exceptionally well to make himself big and block the shot at point blank range."
11',action,"Napoli are just starting to grow into this game now as Arkadiusz Milik picks out Faouzi Ghoulam close to the left-hand touchline and the left-back swings in a superb cross towards the back post, but Alex Sandro is well positioned and heads the ball clear."
9',action,"There are plenty of boos as Dybala prepares to take a Juventus corner from the left-hand side but he still whips in a good ball into a dangerous area, but Medhi Benatia can’t get a clean connection on his header and the ball goes harmlessly out for a goal kick."
7',action,"Napoli do get the chance to knock the ball around amongst the back four and they work it patiently to Insigne on the left-hand side, but Juventus are working hard to put pressure on Napoli without the ball and Bonucci makes a good tackle on the Napoli winger to prevent him breaking into the penalty box."
5',action,Juventus have made a really fast start to this game and Napoli are struggling to get on the ball for any length of time. Their fans are certainly doing their best to get behind them though.
3',action,"A good start for Juventus as Paulo Dybala creates half a yard of space for himself on the right-hand edge of the penalty area and crosses towards Gonzalo Higuain on the penalty spot, but the ball is just behind the striker allowing Piotr Zielinski to clear the ball behind for a corner. Dybala takes the corner short and the ball eventually finds its way to Leonardo Bonucci 12 yards out from goal, but Kalidou Koulibaly gets a good block in to prevent Pepe Reina being called into action."
1',action,Kick-off! Lorenzo Insigne gets the game underway for Napoli.
