,action,"The referee brings things to a close, as Chelsea run out comfortable 3-0 winners thanks to goals from Hazard and Pedro, who ultimatley ended with a brace. Perhaps the scoreline is a little harsh on Bournemouth, who were good for the most part, but in the end the hosts' star quality saw them through."
90'+5',action,FULL-TIME!
90'+4',substitution,; Final change as Batshuayi comes on for Hazard.
90'+3',own-goal,Own Goal Steve Cook ; GOAL!!! CHELSEA WRAP THINGS UP! The hosts show their ruthlessness on the break once again and eventually Pedro sees his effort take a hefty deflection on its way past the helpless Boruc.
90'+1',action,There will be three minutes added on here.
90',substitution,"; Second Chelsea switch now, with Aina replacing the hard-working Moses."
89',action,"Chelsea have done well here today. Bournemouth have looked a threat and been bright at times, but the hosts have looked lethal going forward and dealt with the visitors' attacks well."
87',action,"Good play by Luiz, as he initially gets himself into a muddle due to being surrounded by Ibe and Arter, the latter of whom he nutmegs and wins a free-kick from."
85',action,"What was that? Chelsea initially do really well, as Pedro lays the ball off for Hazard on the edge of the box and he feeds Moses to the right, but the Nigerian's eventual use of the ball is either a horribly miscued shot, or a far too powerful cross. Either way, it went well wide of the left-hand post."
83',substitution,"; First Chelsea change now, as Chalobah comes on for Willian."
81',action,"We are back under way, though it remains to be seen whether or not he will continue."
79',action,"We have a bit of a pause in play now, as Wilshere receives medical attention. He might just have a bit of cramp."
77',substitution,"; Final change for Bournemouth now, as Ibe replaces Brad Smith. An attacking switch from Howe."
76',action,"Moses does well to rob Gosling in the Bournemouth half and he quickly picks out Hazard. He darts into the right side of the box, twisting and turning as he goes, before seeing a left-footed effort go just wide of the far post."
74',action,"CHELSEA ESCAPE! Wonderful pass from Wilshere, as he slices the hosts' defence open with one pass. Afobe latches on to it and looks set for a certain goal, but Courtois rushes out and makes a vital stop."
72',action,"Good defending from Bournemouth. Pedro runs towards goal with only Daniels to beat. He feeds Hazard to the right once they are in the area and he looks to have successfully cut inside Arter, but the midfielder sticks a foot in and comes away with it."
70',action,"The corner comes to nothing, though, as Hazard's delivery is flicked on by Cook at the front post and carries on across goal."
69',action,"Excellent play by Chelsea on the break again. Hazard darts up the inside-left channel and then flicks the ball inside Cook, leaving him on his backside. The Belgian goes for goal, but it is deflected behind for a corner."
67',substitution,; And their second sees Stanislas take over from Surman.
66',substitution,"; Two changes coming up now for Bournemouth, as Afobe replaces King for the first."
66',action,"Excellent from Pedro, as he darts in from the right and breezes past Daniels. He lines up a shot 25 yards from goal and sends a left-footed effort just wide of the bottom-left corner."
65',action,"That's better from Cook, as he tracks the run of Willian when Chelsea break and he manages to rob the Brazilian an pass back to Boruc."
63',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Pedro Eliezer Rodríguez Ledesma ; Pedro tracks Arter and tries to steal possession away with a tackle from behind, but his attempt is mistimed and he gets booked."
62',action,"Fantastic play by Willian, as he does a clever pirouette to take two defenders out of the game, before heading towards the left and offloading. Bournemouth don't have an answer to Chelsea's front three at the moment."
60',action,JUST WIDE! Hazard plays a short corner and he quickly gets the ball back again. He gets to the edge of the box and crosses towards the 'D' and Moses meets it with a volley which goes just wide of the bottom-left corner.
59',action,"WILLIAN AGAIN! The Brazilian is released into the box and he darts past two tackles before getting a shot away from a tight angle, with Boruc equal to it."
57',action,"Bournemouth are starting to see a bit more of the ball and Fabregas is lucky to avoid a booking for catching Wilshere with a strong challenge. The visitors are leaving themselves open on the break, though."
55',action,"Another fine delivery from Willian on the right, as his cross is flashed right into the goalmouth. Boruc manages to pounce on it just in time, though he does take a bit of a whack from Pedro. The Spaniard's attempt to get the ball was honest, though, and there are no cards brandished in his direction."
53',action,"Bournemouth have no answer to Hazard. The Belgian runs at Francis again, who stands off a bit and allows him the space to get a shot away. It goes wide of the far post and it just a little too far ahead of Pedro, who can't get to it to steer it in."
51',action,"Chelsea come back for more once again. This time Willian clips a lovely pass into the left side of the box for Alonso, but Adam Smith does well to put him under pressure at the crucial moment and his effort sails well over."
49',penalty-goal,"Penalty Goal Eden Hazard ; GOAL!!! CHELSEA DOUBLED THEIR LEAD! Cool as you like from Hazard, as he slots the penalty into the bottom-right corner for his 50th Premier League goal."
49',action,"PENALTY! Brilliant from Hazard yet again, as he gets into the left side of the area and toys with Francis, luring him into a foul and there's no hesitation from the ref."
48',action,"Promising start to the second half for the visitors, but King is crowded out as he races inside from the right, with Cahill sweeping up after he'd initially got beyond Luiz."
46',action,Off we go for the second half.
,action,"The referee brings an entertaining first half to a close with Chelsea one up thanks to Pedro's sublime effort. It's not been easy, with Bournemouth showing plenty of promise at times, but the hosts are deservedly ahead."
45'+2',action,HALF-TIME!
45'+1',action,"The wall does its job, as it blocks Adam Smith's free-kick effort. Luiz then gets in the way of his second attempt on the rebound."
45',action,"Chelsea aren't happy with the referee here. Wilshere is fouled on the edge of the area, but the ref plays the advantage. Smith then smashes over and the referee brings the play back to the foul just outside the box."
43',action,Bournemouth are giving this a good go and still stroking the ball around well. But at the moment Chelsea's organised defensive unit is proving something of a barricade.
41',action,"Good play by Willian, as he gets behind Brad Smith and flashes a teasing delivery right acoss the face of goal. No one is there to tap it in, though."
39',action,"Hazard has been unplayable in the first half. Again he pops up on the left and beats his man with his first touch then skips past another, before slipping a lovely pass through for Willian. His return pass isn't quite as good, though."
37',action,"JUST OVER! Fantastic turn by Hazard, as he receives a pass into feet and spins away from Cook with his first touch, forcing the defender into a cynical foul 25 yards from goal. Fabregas steps up to the free-kick and sees it land on the roof of the net. Very close."
35',action,"Sloppy from Surman, as he gives the ball away inside his own half and Pedro pounces, easing away from the midfielder and then disguising his pass into the area for Willian. He flicks it in the direction of Hazard, but Francis is there to hammer clear."
34',action,"Chelsea corner, as Alonso races up the left flank and sees a cross deflected behind by Smith. But the set-piece comes to nothing, with Bournemouth coping ably."
32',action,"No penalty! Bournemouth feel they may have been due a spot-kick after Adam Smith was sent tumbling in the area by Matic, but there wasn't much in it and the referee rightly ignored their protests."
31',action,"CHELSEA ESCAPE! The Bournemouth free-kick is poorly cleared by Matic, with his header going straight to Wilshere, who sees a goal-bound half-volley deflected just wide."
30',action,"Good driving run from Wilshere, as he darts forward and is eventually fouled - rather cynically - by Fabregas, who manages to escape a booking."
29',action,"Unbelievable effort from Hazard on the edge of the area, as his 'rabona' effort forces Boruc into a great save. The referee had blown for a free-kick to Bournemouth just before, but neither looked to be aware."
28',action,"Good response from the visitors. King does well to pick up a forward pass. He cuts it back to Adam Smith, who in turn squares a pass along the edge of the area to Wilshere, who drives into the box and sees a shot deflected behind. The corner doesn't come to much, though."
26',action,"Good tackle by Luiz, as Brad Smith looks to latch on to a good pass played in behind Moses by Surman and the Brazilian comes flying in, taking the ball away in style."
24',assist,"Assist Francesc Fàbregas i Soler ; Fabregas showed good awareness to find his international team-mate, but the finish was all Pedro."
24',goal,"Goal Pedro Eliezer Rodríguez Ledesma ; GOAL!!! CHELSEA HAVE THE LEAD! A wonderful effort from Pedro, as he receives a short pass from Fabregas and digs a delicate curling effort into the top-left corner. A delightful goal."
23',action,"Brilliant play by Hazard again. He's chased out, but he turns excellently and darts back towards the Bournemouth goal, dribbling beyond three. He then finds Fabregas on the edge of the box and he looks to Moses, who wins a corner."
22',action,"The hosts are starting to take control here. Bournemouth are hit on the break as Hazard picks out a gap in their defence and feeds Pedro. He picks up possession on the edge of the box, gets inside and shoots right-footed, seeing his effort goes just wide of the far post."
20',action,"Chelsea threaten again, this time down the right. Hazard is at the centre of things once more, threading a pass into the area in behind Brad Smith, but he manages to get on to it and knock it on to Moses before going out for a goal-kick. Good defending."
18',action,"Good feet by Matic, as he skips past one challenge and gets into the left side of the area, but Gosling comes across and smashes clear before he can get a shot away."
17',action,"Great defending! Bournemouth threaten on the break, as Adam Smith gets up the right flank and drives a low cross into the danger zone. It evades Luiz and King looks destined for a simple finish, but Azpilicueta is there to intervene at the crucial moment."
15',action,"The ball breaks kindly for Hazard in a central position this time and he has a go from 25 yards, but his effort is a pretty tame one which is pounced upon by Boruc."
14',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Jack Wilshere ; First yellow card of the match now, as Wilshere goes in rather wildly on Fabregas, crashing into him from behind and catching him with his forearm."
14',action,"Patient build-up play by Chelsea is eventually wasted, as Alonso prods the ball up the flank for Hazard, who is caught offside."
12',action,"The corner does not come to much, though, as Cahill heads it clear and Bournemouth work it back to Boruc."
11',action,"King does well at the other end now, as he holds the ball up well, dragging Luiz out to the left and then winning a free-kick from the Brazilian. Francis' delivery is deep and finds Cook, who wins a corner from Alonso."
10',action,"Great run by Hazard, as he picks the ball up on the halfway line and darts forward. He exchanges a one-two with Pedro and drives into the box, before being forced out wide. Eventually Chelsea end up playing the ball back to their defence, but at least they kept hold of possession."
9',action,"Adam Smith is adamant he should have been given a free-kick out on the right, as the winger knocks the ball through the legs of the approaching Luiz, who appears to catch the Bournemouth man ever so slightly. The referee waves play on."
7',action,"Willian's corner gets flicked on at the near post by Cahill, but Boruc gobbles it up with ease and Bournemouth survive."
6',action,"Almost an opening for the hosts! Fabregas plays a quick free-kick in behind the centre-backs for Pedro, but his first touch gets a little ahead of him and Francis puts it behind for a corner."
5',action,"Better now from the visitors, as they work their way up the left with Brad Smith. But instead of crossing he opts to cut back and the move somewhat peters out."
3',action,"Bournemouth are showing plenty of early energy, getting into Chelsea and pressing to good effect, but it is the home side taking the initiative so far."
1',action,Off we go! Chelsea get us started.
,action,"The teams are out on the pitch at Stamford Bridge, with kick-off just a few moments away."
,action,"Bournemouth actually won on their last visit to Stamford Bridge last season, running out 1-0 victors. However, they come up against an entirely different beast this time around. Chelsea are in phenomenal form and steamrolling everyone at the moment. They may not have the abilities of Costa to count upon today, but Hazard - even out of position - isn't a bad replacement. Eddie Howe's men will do very well to come away with a result today, one would imagine."
,action,"For the visitors, there aren't a great amount of surprises. Both Andrew Surman and Brad Smith come back in and Callum Wilson drops to the bench, while alongside him amongst the substitutes will be Junior Stanislas, back from a troublesome ankle injury."
,action,"Many had expected Michy Batshuayi to lead the line in Costa's absence, with the Belgian tipped for his first Premier League start since joining from Marseille. However, once again he has to be satisfied with a spot on the bench. Antonio Conte spoke at length about him in the build-up today and was full of praise for his attitude and patience, but it's not much of a vote of confidence to see the coach opt for no strikers when he is available."
,action,"The league leaders have been forced into a couple of changes today due to suspensions, with N'Golo Kante and Diego Costa absent. In midfield Cesc Fabregas gets to stake his claim alongside Nemanja Matic, while Willian is the one who profits in attack. He starts out wide, with both he and Pedro flanking Eden Hazard who occupies a more central role."
,action,"Bournemouth subs: Federici, Mings, Fraser, Stanislas, Afobe, Ibe, Wilson."
,action,"Bournemouth starting XI (4-2-3-1): Boruc; Francis, Cook, B. Smith, Daniels; Arter, Gosling; A. Smith, Wilshere, Surman; King."
,action,"Chelsea starting XI (3-4-3): Courtois; Azpilicueta, David Luiz, Cahill; Moses, Fabregas, Matic, Alonso; Willian, Hazard, Pedro."
,action,"Chelsea starting XI (3-4-3): Courtois; Azpilicueta, David Luiz, Cahill; Moses, Fabregas, Matic, Alonso; Willian, Hazard, Pedro."
,action,"First of all, let's introduce the teams..."
,action,"Hello and welcome to the LIVE coverage of the Premier League encounter between Chelsea and Bournemouth. I will be describing the action for you today, as the pacesetters look to continue their fine form over the festive period."
