90',action,Alves goes to ground very easily once again. Not the best outing of professionalism from the Brazilian.
89',action,Juventus seem content to see this one out after Dybala's near miss. They're keeping possession at the back and are knocking it around with relative ease.
88',action,"CLOSE! Dybala collects on the edge of the box and attempts to bend his strike into the top corner, but his effort creeps inches past the post."
87',action,"OVER! Buchel collects 35 yards from goal and tries an ambitious strike, but hammers his effort into the stand behind the goal."

81',action,"CHANCE! Mandzukic threads the ball into the path of Higuain, but the striker just cannot bring the ball down in time before Costa clears it away from him."
79',substitution,; Rincon replaces Marchisio for the final stages of the match.
78',action,"MISS! Higuain is having one of those days in front of goal as he fails to hit the target once again. Alves lifts the ball into the box for the Argentine to attack, but fails to make sufficient contact to guide his effort at goal."
77',substitution,; Buchel replaces Mauri for the visitors.
76',action,"DISALLOWED GOAL! Higuain pounces on the rebound and lifts the ball back to Dybala to slot into the net from close range. However, the offside flag was up against the Argentine as he pounced on the ball."

63',action,Empoli waste a chance to threaten from a free-kick and there is feeling that the game is beginning to open up. The next goal will be crucial.

60',action,"OVER! Space opens up through the middle of the Empoli defence and Sturaro collects a pass from Mandzukic on the edge of the box, but he can only fire his effort over the bar."
58',action,"CHANCE! Marilungo slides the ball into the path of El Kaddouri inside the box. He takes a touch to open up space for a shot at goal, but he only blast his effort over the bar."
56',action,Krunic puts the pressure on the Juve backline with good pressing on the edge of their own box and Sandro's header back to Neto just has enough pace to reach the keeper.

52',own-goal,"Own Goal Łukasz Skorupski ; GOALLLL!!! JUVE TAKE THE LEAD! Skorupski may have turned this one into his own net, but Mandzukic's powerful header caused the error.

52',action,"Alves has been a constant outlet down the right flank this evening, but between Mandzukic's heading and solid defending from Empoli, his crossing has not been rewarded thus far."

,action,"It's goalless at the break between Juventus and Empoli as the home side have failed to fire in the final third. Mario Mandzukic and Gonzalo Higuain have both missed half-chances, although the visitors have defended stoutly for the majority of the contest."
,action,HALF-TIME: JUVENTUS 0-0 EMPOLI
45',action,The referee ends the first half.

43',action,Krunic makes one of his first mistakes of the game he brings down Sturaro on the edge of the box. Pjanic will take the resulting set-piece.
41',action,"There's no way through for Juve at the moment as they recycle possession on the edge of the box, but cannot penetrate the Empoli backline. Alves lifts a cross into the box, aiming for Mandzukic, but Skorupski comes off his line to claim."
39',action,"CHANCE AND PENALTY SHOUT! Juve go up for a handball against Krunic as Sturaro knocks the ball off his arm. The ball travels out to Pjanic on the edge of the box, who blasts an effort towards the net, only to see his strike drift wide of the post."
36',action,"CHANCE! Higuain drifts into space to collect the ball and he whips a dangerous cross towards the back stick for Mandzukic to attack. The striker stretches for the balll, but once again he cannot make solid contact as he sends his effort wide."
34',action,"Sandro attempts to beat Krunic down the left flank, but the Empoli midfielder sends him tumbling to the deck. The visitors need to be careful in the wide areas as that's an area where Juve have had success this evening."
32',action,Empoli are battling well against the home side and are ensuring that Allegri's men are having to work extremely hard to earn their chances at goal.
30',action,"CHANCE! Juve open the Empoli defence with a fine attacking move as Cuadrado plays in Mandzukic. The striker has space and time to pick his spot, but he dwells too long on the opening, allowing Skorupski to smother the ball at his feet with the aid of El Hadji."
28',action,"Not a good moment for Alves as he throws himself to the ground looking for a free-kick. There was no contact from Costa as the Brazilian attempted to con the referee, and he is lucky to escape without a booking there."

26',action,"Sandro gives the ball straight to El Kaddouri, who makes a threatening surge forward. Sturaro comes back to make a sliding challenge and although the Empoli midfielder pleads for a free-kick, the referee does not grant him his wish."
25',action,"Alves sends a cross to the back post and the ball almost falls for Sturaro to strike, but he is adjudged to have fouled Bellusci before he can pull the trigger on his strike."
23',action,Juve have started this match very sluggishly and have lacked any sort of rhythm in their passing game. Allegri will want to see more from Marchisio and Pjanic to get a hold of the match in the middle of the park.
22',action,"WIDE! El Kaddouri makes a promising break to race away from Rugani and Bonucci, but as both defenders close in on the midfielder, he opts to shoot with his left foot and slices his strike past the post."
19',action,"Marilungo tries to slide Pucciarelli into the box, but the two players are not on the same page, allowing Neto to gather."
18',action,Costa does well to sense the danger on the left flank as he comes across to clear ahead of Cuadrado and wins a free-kick as the winger clatters into him.
17',action,"El Hadji sends an ambitious pass down the left flank for Pasqual to chase. Alves is nowhere in sight to protect the opening, but it proves to have too much pace for the Empoli left-back to catch."
14',action,"Sandro hits a peach of a cross-field pass over to Cuadrado on the right flank, but the winger wastes the opening with a terrible cross. The loose ball manages to find Marchisio 35 yards out, but he pulls his strike well past the post."
12',action,WIDE! Cuadrado is afforded space and time once again near the edge of the box and he drives a low shot at goal. On this occasion it's an Empoli shirt that diverts his strike past the post.

6',action,"OVER! Juve keep the pressure on the visitors and Alves sends a dangerous cross to the back post for Mandzukic to attack, only to see his header drift over the bar."
5',action,"CHANCE! Higuain spurns the opportunity to put his side ahead as Mandzukic heads Sandro's cross into his path inside the six-yard box. He pokes the ball towards the bottom corner, but without the power needed to beat Skorupski."
4',action,"Marchisio attempts to slide a throughball for Higuain's run behind the Empoli defence, but the ball skips off the surface and goes out for a goal-kick."

1',action,We're underway in this Serie A contest.
,action,"The players are making their way out on to the pitch, so we should be underway shortly."

Juve also triumphed during the week in the first leg of their Champions League clash against Porto, displaying their quality on the road."
,action,"Empoli are floating narrowly above the relegation zone. They are eight points clear of 18th-place Palermo, but will be desperate to pick up points to ease their concerns."
,action,"Juve can stretch their lead at the top of Serie A to 10 points with a victory this evening. Massimiliano Allegri's men have been boosted already today by Napoli's defeat to Atalanta, reducing their threat in the race for the title."
