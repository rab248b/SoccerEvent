85',action,"OVER! Gray releases the run of Arfield on the right flank and the midfielder has space and time to fire an effort at goal. However, he loses his composure and fires his strike over the bar."

42',action,Tarkowski makes an important clearance in the box to clear the danger for the Clarets following Rhead's header.

29',action,"Darikwa sends a looping cross towards the edge of the six-yard box for Vokes to attack. Farman is unsure whether to come off his line, but he eventually does. Vokes is the man who makes contact, but the pressure provided by Raggett is enough to stop the header finding the target."
27',action,"CHANCE! Arfield flicks the ball over Waterfall and Gray has a clear sight at goal with an effort on the half-volley. However, he fails to connect cleanly with his strike and Farman makes a comfortable save."
26',action,"Wood sends a dangerous cross towards the near post for Muldoon to attack, but Tarkowski just manages to nudge the forward out of position as he attempts to make contact."

7',action,"Barton wins the ball in the middle of the park and stabs a pass forward aiming for Gray, but Waterfall is there to clear out for a throw."
5',action,"CHANCE! Lincoln should be ahead as Arnold does brilliantly to beat Tarkowski's challenge and he slides the ball across the face of goal for Muldoon, but he loses his composure in front of the net, firing over the bar."
