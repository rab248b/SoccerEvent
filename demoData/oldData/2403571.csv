,action,"Full-time at Wembley. Manchester United have WON the League Cup after a dramatic 3-2 victory over Southampton. United went into the break 2-1 up following goals from Ibrahimovic and Lingard, but the Saints rallied after the break and got back on equal terms with a brace from Gabbiadini. It was to be a Red Devil day, though, as the former PSG striker popped up near the end with the header to win it for Mourinho's men. Thanks for joining us!"
90'+2',action,"FOUR minutes of added time have been allocated by the referee here which may just give Southampton one last kick up the backside to go and press forward. United have bags of experience out there now, and they will need all of it to see this one out."
90',substitution,"; Things are getting desperate for Southampton and Puel now as he makes his last throw of the dice by sending on a striker for a midfielder. Jay Rodriguez has been tasked with saving the Saints, with Davis quickly sprinting off to save as much time as possible."
89',substitution,"; Mourinho is looking to shut-up-shop now as he makes a defensive change. Fellaini is the man coming on, presumably for his aerial prowess against these continuous crosses, and he will replace Martial."
87',assist,Assist Ander Herrera Agüera ; A massive assist for Herrera following a perfect cross!
87',goal,"Goal Zlatan Ibrahimović ; GOOOOAAAAAALLLLLL! GOOOOAAAALLL FOR MANCHESTER UNITED! Have they gone and won it?! Martial picks out a threaded pass to the back post for Herrera, who in turn clips an absolutely perfect cross into the edge of the six-yard for box Ibrahimovic, who bullets a header home to make it 3-2! INCREDIBLE!"
85',action,"Bertrand goes on another marauding run down the left wing and gets beyond the challenge of Martial before flashing a fantastic cross along the six-yard box, but there are no team-mates there to smash home! That was absolutely begging to be converted for the winning goal, but United survive!"
83',substitution,"; Gabbiadini won't have the opportunity to claim his hat-trick as he makes his way off for the last seven minutes or so to be replaced by Shane Long. One thing is for sure, the United defenders won't want the relentless pressing of the Irishman to contend with as their legs start to tire."
81',action,"Just under 10 minutes remaining of normal play now, and don't forget, after 90 minutes we will go on to extra-time and penalties if the scoreline remains the same. To be fair to both teams, though, they look like they want to go on and win this in regulation time!"
79',action,"Martial picks up the ball whilst hugging the left touchline but is immediately pounced upon by Ward-Prowse and Cedric who combine well to win possession back and launch the counter. Boufal eventually sees possession and then goes on a twisting and turning run, but holds on to the ball for too long before losing it."
77',substitution,"; Puel, in turn, makes an alteration too as Tadic comes off for Sofiane Boufal."
77',substitution,"; That miss will be Lingard's last contribution to the play, as he is replaced by Marcus Rashford."
76',action,"A POOR MISS FROM LINGARD! United enjoy some decent stringed passed in the final third before a cross is eventually sent in that evades everyone in the central area. The Englishman goes for his second goal of the game with a half-volley, but ends up slicing an awful strike over the bar from eight yards."
74',action,Poor from Ibrahimovic this time as his free-kick is slammed disappointingly int the sturdy Southampton wall.
73',action,"Pogba strides forward into the right channel but with three men eventually around him, he is forced to cut back inside before winning the foul around 30 yards out. Now, like the opener, Ibrahimovic fancies another strike on goal..."
71',action,"It is now United's turn to threaten from a set-piece as they are awarded a free-kick in a useful area on the right channel. However, even with all the height inside the box, it is taken low to the edge of the box for Carrick, who can only muster up a weak first-time strike aimlessly sent back into the box. Poor in the end."
69',action,"Much, much better from Martial this time as he takes on two or three tackles down the left wing with a cracking, speedy dribble. He moves into a dangerous area before threading a lovely little pass in behind the Southampton defence, but before Lingard can pull the trigger, Yoshida comes in with a superb interception."
67',action,"Southampton are causing massive problems for United with their set-pieces here, as each and every time a cross is sent in it meets a Saints head or bounces dangerously inside the box. Definitely a potential source for the winning goal for Puel's men."
65',action,"Pogba hasn't really been at the races so far today but does much better this time as he shows strength to shake off the tackle of Davis before opening up his considerable stride with a penetrating move forward. Southampton manage to get back into defensive positions quickly, though, which means the Frenchman is forced to pass square for Herrera."
63',action,"SOUTHAMPTON HIT THE WOODWORK! Ward-Prowse poses a threat from another corner here as this one is swung ominously to the back post. Romeu rises above everyone, including his marker Pogba, to bullet a header on goal, but it ends up cannoning off the outside of the post! United survive - JUST!"
61',action,"There has been an ongoing feud developing between Herrera and Romeu throughout this game, so much so they both earned yellow cards in the first half for tackles on each other. The next installment sees the former go in with a high arm on his compatriot, who wants to see another card shown for the altercation."
59',action,"Ibrahimovic does really well to keep the ball in play with a lovely touch before popping a pass to the opposite wing for Valencia. Another cross comes back inside and Martial looks poised to pull the trigger on the volley, only for Pogba to get in the way of his team-mate after a poor lack of communication!"
57',action,"After a pretty breathless opening 10 minutes to this second period in which Southampton got back on level terms, there is a bit more structure and control in proceedings. United, meanwhile, look to be regaining their confidence going forward."
56',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Nathan Redmond ; Redmond is the latest player to see yellow now, and there are a good numbers of players out there who are risking a red whilst on a booking."
54',action,United are just showing a good bit of experience here to halt the ascendancy of Southampton with a period of patient possession along the back and in to midfield. Carrick has been key to this as he has showed composure and control to stop any springed attacks from the Saints.
52',action,"The ascendancy in this game has just massively switched over to Southampton and it is indeed Puel's men who are playing with their tails up now. The confidence seems to be flowing, and with nobody more than Gabbiadini who is on the cusp on becoming the first player ever to score a League Cup final hat-trick."
50',action,"Lingard is very, very lucky not to be heading to the dressing room here as, whilst on a yellow card, he clearly clips the heels of Redmond who was ominously on his way down the right wing. The Southampton man doesn't actually go down, which have proved to be the United man's saving grace."
48',goal,"Goal Manolo Gabbiadini ; GOOOOAAAAAALLLL FOR SOUTHAMPTON! We are back on level terms! Another cross into the box is cleared from United, but only as far as Davis who clips in another delivery. Gabbiadini latches on to the bouncing ball with a quite brilliant half-volleyed finish into the bottom right corner! De Gea just stood still! TWO-TWO!"
48',assist,Assist Steven Davis ; Assist Steven Davis
48',action,"SUPERB ATTEMPT FROM REDMOND! Following a Southampton corner which is cleared, Yoshida recycles a cross to the back post for his team-mate, who fires a brilliantly-connected volley down the centre of goal, but De Gea is equal to it and punches it away commandingly."
46',substitution,"; A change at the break with United as Mata comes off for Carrick, which will likely mean Pogba moving further forward."
46',action,We are back under way at Wembley.
,action,"Half-time at Wembley. It has been a cracking opening 45 minutes as Manchester United head into the break 2-1 up over Southampton, with Ibrahimovic, Lingard, and Gabbiadini all on target for their respective outfits. United looked in control, but the Saints are now back in with a shout after scoring so near to half-time. Second period to come."
45'+1',assist,Assist James Ward-Prowse ; Lovely set-up from Ward-Prowse for the goal.
45'+1',goal,Goal Manolo Gabbiadini ; GOOOOAAAAAALLLL FOR SOUTHAMPTON! The Saints are back in this! Ward-Prowse drifts away down the right wing and is awarded too much room by Rojo which allows the cross to the whipped to the front post. Gabbiadini just gets ahead of his marker in the middle to divert a lovely little first-time finish into the net! Two-one.
43',action,"Tadic latches on to a mistake at the back from Rojo and collects the ball on the edge of the box before driving into the danger area. He takes on Bailly before going for the shot on goal, but it is slammed into the side-netting after the former Villarreal man defends with composure and strength."
41',yellow-card,Yellow Card Jesse Lingard ; Lingard sees yellow for dissent after protesting to the referee about the decision not to send off Stephens.
40',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Jack Stephens ; Stephens goes into the book now for a VERY late tackle on Martial and all the United players are demanding a red be shown. It is just a booking in the end, which is probably the correct decision."
38',assist,Assist Faustino Marcos Alberto Rojo ; Cracking assist from Rojo after some lovely teamwork on the left.
38',goal,"Goal Jesse Lingard ; GOOOOAAAAAAAAAALLL FOR UNITED! The Red Devils double the lead! Mata, Martial, and Rojo are all involved in a lovely bit of interplay down the left and it is the Argentine who then takes possession inside before popping a square pass to Lingard. The Englishman shows a cracking bit of composure to then pass a finish into the right-hand corner. Two-nil!"
36',action,"United enjoy a period of sustained possession, but again it is along the backline with every Southampton player behind the ball. Pogba eventually comes deep to see more of the ball before attempting to launch a long pass over the top for Martial, but it is drastically overhit which allows Forster to collect."
34',action,"Ward-Prowse stands over a corner down the left wing and whips it to the near post where Stephens actually collects to feet right next to the byline. The young defender unselfishly attempts to reverse a pass back inside to Yoshida for the tap in, but Smalling JUST manages to stick a leg out to clear. Time seemed to stand still there!"
32',action,"Redmond twists and turns his way into the middle of the park before firing a pass in for Tadic. The Serbian takes the touch in to feet with nobody around him 20 yards out before drilling a strike towards the bottom corner, but De Gea manages to make the solid save, even if it is in slightly awkward fashion with his legs!"
30',action,"Gabbiadini, who has been quiet since that offside goal, peels away to the right wing this time and dances his way to the byline to try and take on Rojo. He gains a yard of space on the defender before sending a cross into the box with the outside of his left foot, but United manage to clear the danger away with relative ease."
28',action,"SAVE FROM DE GEA! Just as your commentator claims Southampton haven't tested De Gea, they immediately do so! Ward-Prowse is the man who tries his luck with a strike on goal from around 25-yards out, but the Spaniard superbly gets down to his right-hand side to palm away. That was nestling in the corner for sure!"
26',action,"A pretty decent reaction from Southampton to going a goal behind, but they are yet to really test De Gea between the sticks. The goal from Ibrahimovic will make the disallowed goal for Gabbiadini all the more harder to take."
24',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ander Herrera Agüera ; Herrera goes into the book now, and this one is slightly harsh as the Spaniard goes in slightly late on Romeu."
23',action,"Rojo just manages to keep the ball in down the left wing and flashes a pass into the feet of Lingard, who cleverly flicks possession in to the feet of Martial. However, Cedric defends really well on this occasion as he gets his body between himself and the Frenchman before moving the play inside to find a team-mate."
21',action,"Well, that is certainly a kick in the teeth for Southampton who have been the better side in the opening quarter of play. A silly decision from Romeu and a moment of magic from Ibrahimovic have now seen them go behind with a mountain to climb, but they shouldn't deviate too much from their brave gameplan which seemed to be working."
19',goal,"Goal Zlatan Ibrahimović ; GOOOOAAAAALLL! GOOAAAALL FOR UNITED! Mourinho's outfit open the scoring! From the subsequent free-kick from the Romeo foul, Ibrahimovic steps up to whip an absolutely fantastic strike up and over the wall into the bottom left corner! One-nil."
18',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Oriol Romeu Vidal ; First booking of the match now and it is a deserved one for Romeu as he needlessly slides in to catch the ankle of Herrerra, and stop a promising United attack in the process. The Spaniard will need to watch himself out there now."
16',action,"United have managed to weather that mini-storm for Southampton a bit and are seeing the ball more now, but it is coming in areas which are posing zero threat to the opposition. The two players who have seen the most possession for United are probably Smalling and Bailly at the back."
14',action,"Young Jack Stephens and Yoshida at the back for Southampton certainly have their work cut out this afternoon in dealing with Ibrahimovic. However, the duo have been proactive in their defending so far and are just managing to pip the big Swede to possession when it is sent up top."
12',action,"Southampton looking much the smarter outfit, even with United enjoying the slight majority of possession. The Saints are pressing more and more now, and have just won two consecutive corner-kicks in a row which have been dealth with unconvincingly by Mourinho's charges. That disallowed goal will certainly put a fire in their belly too!"
10',action,"GOOOOAAAAAAAAALLLL FOR SOUTHAMPTON! WAIT! NO! OFFSIDE! Cedric gets into an advanced position down the right and hits the byline before squaring a pass for Gabbiadini who tucks home. The linesman puts his flag up, which appears to be the wrong decision. Redmond was off, but the Italian was behind Smalling!"
8',action,"Redmond collects the ball in the middle of the park and cleverly jinks past a couple of tackles, holding off the attentions of Pogba in the process. He pulls the trigger with a strike which is dragged the wrong side of the right-hand post, but Southampton get the corner as it apparently took a deflection off Herrerra on the route through."
6',action,"United are just starting to find their feet a little more in terms of their control of the ball. Southampton continue to press at a great tempo, but Mourinho's men seem equipped to deal with it currently. Puel has definitely told his players to try and steal possession to try and counter as much as possible."
4',action,"Forster's gloves are tested for the first time in the match as Ibrahimovic plays square to Pogba, who unleashes a cracking strike from 25 yards. The Frenchman is left frustrated though as the attempt goes straight down the throat of the former Celtic stopper."
3',action,"Before today's match, Southampton have actually had a fortnight break with no games, while United have featured four times in that period of time. The sharpness of the Saints is evident in the opening proceedings as they are pressing United with an impressively high tempo."

,action,TEAM NEWS...
,action,"United and Southampton have already faced each other once this season which was a fixture in the English Premier League. On that occasion at Old Trafford back in the middle of August, Mourinho's men ran out relatively comfortable 2-0 winners thanks to a vintage double from Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The Swede's form has not waned since then as he continues to prove himself as a fabulous signing."
,action,"Southampton, however, have not enjoyed particular success in terms of trophies in recent years. Their last appearance in a cup final at Wembley was back in 2010 when they took on Carlisle and successfully won the Johnstone's Paint trophy. They lost their last League Cup final all the way back in 1979 against Nottingham Forest and have not won cup silverware since the 1976 FA Cup when their opponents were, you guessed it, Manchester United."
,action,"Like Mourinho, Manchester United as a club have enjoyed success in the competition over the years. This will be the Red Devils' ninth final appearance, although their record is rather hot and cold as they have won four and lost four, even if the last three have resulted in them lifting the trophy. The last time they were crowned League Cup champions was back in 2010 when they defeated Aston Villa 2-1 with Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen grabbing the goals."
,action,"Today is the first opportunity of the season for the teams in England to claim their first piece of silverware, and it is Jose Mourinho who will go up against Claude Puel for the chance to lift the trophy. The Portuguese coach has impressive history in this tournament, having lifted the League Cup three times during his tenure at Chelsea."
