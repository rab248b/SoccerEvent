,action,"Full time and Inter walk away 3-0 winners. Nobody expected Pescara to get anything this evening, and they never looked like doing so."
90'+1',action,The tempo in this match has completely died now as Inter knock the ball around the pitch to run down time and collect their rightfully deserved three points this evening.
88',action,"This match is reaching the closing stages now and it seems as if it may stay at 3-0. Pescara have fought hard, but they're simply not good enough to compete with Inter."
86',action,"Inter are pushing so many attackers forward in this late stage, it almost seems as if they're playing with four strikers. Eder is finding joy on the left side and wins a corner for Inter, but little comes of it."
85',substitution,; Substitution Danilo D'Ambrosio Davide Santon
83',action,"Almost an opportunity for Eder as Brozovic attempts to squeeze a pass through to the striker, but Bizzarri is aware of the danger and is able to beat the striker to the ball."
82',substitution,; Pescara use their final sub as Cubas comes on for Kastanos.
81',action,"SAVE! Bizzarri was called into action from range as he pushed a shot from Icardi wide, but Pescara were only able to concede a corner. Fortunately for them the delivery from the set-piece was poor and they managed to clear their lines."
79',action,It appears as if Pioli is showing no mercy for his counterparts as he introduces another striker to the pitch. Inter are sensing blood here and they want more goals.
77',action,The San Siro is in fantastic voice as the Inter fans sound their approval of the performance on display from their side. The home side have dominated this match from start to finish.
76',substitution,; Gabriel is brought on for Candreva.
75',substitution,; Bahebeck comes off for Cerri.
75',action,"Pescara are left with the choice of damage limitation or to play for pride now, and with the side sitting bottom of the league and goal difference proving vital in the battle for survival. It wouldn't be a surprise to see the former."
73',assist,"Assist Mauro Emanuel Icardi Rivero ; Icardi breaks the defensive line and squares a pass to Eder for the goal, but the replay suggested the Argentinian was offside when the ball was intially played to him. Goal still stands."
73',goal,"Goal Eder Citadin Martins ; GOAL! Inter kill the contest and it's Eder, the sub, with the goal. Three Inter players got beyond the defence to make for an easy goal and to kill off this contest."
73',action,"This is possibly Pescara's best spell for a long time in this match. The away side have finally managed to have a prolonged period of possession in Inter's half, which appears to be frustrating the home support."
71',substitution,; Perisic's evening is brought to a close as he's subbed off for Eder.
71',action,"A brilliantly struck shot from range by Kastanos looks as if it may have tested Handanovic for a second, but the goalkeeper's positioning was perfect as he shifted across his goal to gather the ball."
69',action,"Memushaj does really well on the right side to work a corner for the visitors with some neat footwork. However, the delivery into the box from the set-piece is turned behind for another corner at the near post."
67',yellow-card,Yellow Card Cristiano Biraghi ; Birraghi collects a yellow for a foul on Brozovic.
67',action,"Whilst Inter are still firmly on top, the home side are being reduced to long range shots. Both of their goals in this match have come from the left side, but they've mainly been attacking down the center in the second half."
65',action,"Joao Mario rides a challenge well then finds Brozovic on the edge of the box, but like his previous attempt from range the Serbian is unable to hit the target."
63',action,STAT: Pescara have never taken the lead in the Serie A this season.
61',action,"CLOSE! A lovely pass from Nagatomo finds Candreva on the left who manages to get a shot off from a tight angle, but his shot is deflected over the crossbar by Coda."
59',action,CHANCE! Pescara should be level. Bahebeck is denied by Handanovic from close range then Verre fires over the rebound. The best chance the away side has had all evening.
57',action,"A free-kick is awarded to Pescare in a dangerous position after a poorly timed tackle from D'Ambrosio is left the referee with no choice. However, Bahebeck's shot on goal is just over the crossbar."

54',yellow-card,Yellow Card Yuto Nagatomo ; First yellow of the match goes to Nagatomo.
54',action,"CHANCE! Brozovic is left with too much room on the edge of the box and the Serbian tries his luck from range, but he leans back too much and fires his effort over the crossbar."
52',action,"Pescara are trying to get numbers forward to get back into this match, but the quality isn't there. A poor pass from Verre on the right side breaks down a move as Miranda intercepts."
50',action,"First shot of the half comes from Candreva who finds himself in room on the edge of the box, but the long ranged drive from the Italian goes wide of Bizzarri's right post."
48',action,Inter are starting this half with the same intentions of the first by committing lots of numbers forward in order to pile as much misery as possible onto the visitors despite the scoreline.
46',action,The second half is underway.
,action,Half time and Inter lead during the break 2-0. Pescara's defence has been nothing short of rubbish throughout this match and if it isn't sorted in the second half Inter could run riot.
45',action,Pescara look like they're going into the half time break 1-0 down without seriously testing Handanovic. The away side have seriously struggled to get a foothold in this match all evening.
43',assist,Assist Ivan Perišić ; A fantastic cross to Perisic to the back past is turned home by Joao Mario as he manages to shake off his marker.
43',goal,Goal João Mário Naval da Costa Eduardo ; GOAL! They've found it. Joao Mario scores in back-to-back games as a drilled cross into the middle is turned home by the midfielder to double Inter's lead on the stroke of half time.
43',action,The tempo in this match has slowed down a bit just as we approach half time. Inter are calmly recycling the ball around as they patiently look to pick a moment to attack.
40',action,"Despite being 1-0 down, Pescara are battling rather hard in this match, it must be said. It's clear their defence is nothing short of shambolic, but the effort is there at least."
38',action,SAVE! Bizzarri is forced into a save from Brozovic but the goalkeeper is unable to keep hold of the effort and drops the play out for a corner kick.
36',action,CLOSE! It should be 2-0 to Inter Milan as a mistake at the back leads to Joao Mario being through on goal but he's unable to chip the ball over Bizzarri.
34',action,"It seems as if the Inter players are becoming a bit greedy already. Candreva had the opportunity to find D'Ambrosio on the overlap, but the winger decided to shoot from range into a sea of blue and white shirts."
32',action,"A lovely clipped ball to Icardi is brought down by the striker, which eventually ends in Perisic trying his luck from the edge of the box, but the Croatian curled his effort wide of Bizzarri's goal."

28',action,"Free-kick in a dangerous position for Pescara as Medel commits a foul on the edge of the box, but Memushaj was unable to beat the wall as it clipped the outside man and deflected away to safety."
26',action,"Shocking defending from Pescara to allow D'Ambrosio to score. There was a number of blue and white shirts back in the box, but the majority of them were marking thin air to leave the full-back and Joao Mario unmarked at the back post."
23',assist,Assist Marcelo Brozović ; A fantastic delivery from Brozovic to the back post to allow D'Ambrosio to put the hosts 1-0 up.
23',goal,"Goal Danilo D'Ambrosio ; GOAL! From one end to the other, Inter Milan lead through D'Ambrosio as a corner kick was whipped to the back post for the full-back to tap home."
23',action,"CLOSE! A scare for Inter as Handanovic spilled a long shot from Verre which was poken in by Kastonas, but the linesman ruled he was offside."
21',action,"Inter are playing some fantastic one-touch football, but they're yet to have a significant chance. If they continue playing like this it could be a very frustrating evening."
19',action,"Back-to-back corners for Inter as they apply a lot of pressure on Pescara, but the basement side deal with the set-pieces well and eventually hack the ball away to safety."
17',action,"Good work from Candreva on the right side creates some room for D'Ambrosio to get a ball into the box, but the full-back takes too long with his effort and it's cleared by Stendardo."
15',action,"Inter are struggling to get the ball into the box despite the home side asserting their control. They keep on shifting the play out onto the wings, expecting a cross, but Candreva and Perisic cut inside without any support on the edge of the area."
13',action,First corner of the match goes the way of Inter as a poor clearance from Zamparo is sliced over the crossbar. The set-piece is drilled into Gagliardini but the midfielder is forced out of the box by the Pescara defence.
11',action,It looks like Inter are going to be patient in this one as Pescara attempt to slow the tempo as much as possible and sit relatively deep. This could be an arduous afternoon for the home side.
9',action,"Bizzarri is called into action for the first time as Icardi runs down a channel and drills a low cross into the middle, but the ball was too close to the goalkeeper who pounces on the play."
7',action,It seems as if Pescara are going to be heavily reliant on their front three to carry the ball forward on counter-attacks as they look to commit just a handful of players forward on attacks.
5',action,"First shot of the match comes from Pescara as the ball breaks to Bahebeck on the left side. The striker manages to come inside onto his left foot, but his effort is dragged wide of Handanovic's goal."
3',action,"Inter are showing early intentions by attacking down the right side early on, but a cross from Candreva is unable to find a blue and black shirt in the Pescara box."
1',action,Pescara get the match underway.
,action,"Just five minutes until kick-off! The fans are in their seats, the players are in the tunnel and the atmosphere is building. Not long now."
,action,"Stefano Pioli has decided to reward Joao Mario with a start after coming off the bench to find the winner for Inter last time out and has also mixed up the defence by dropping Ansaldi and Murillo to the bench.

,action,CONFIRMED TEAM NEWS
,action,"Residing at the bottom of the league with nine points, there is never a good opponent to play. However, the form team in the league certainly wouldn't have been high on Massimo Oddo's wishlist as he takes his squad to the San Siro this evening."
,action,"Currently sitting on an eight match winning streak, even the most ardent Pescara fan will admit Inter Milan are heavy favourites heading into this match. Despite only beating Palermo 1-0 last time out, Inter sit on the best form of their season and it’s unlikely bottom-placed Pescara sit in the way."
