,action,"Not the send-off Avram Grant would have hoped for, but the Black Stars will return home with nothing to show for their efforts at this year's finals."

84',action,"OFORI DENIES NAKOULMA!!! The Burkina Faso attacker storms into the box, but his final touch is too heavy, and Ofori comes off his line to stop him."
83',substitution,; Substitution Yacouba Coulibaly Patrick Malo
82',action,"Patrick Malo is getting ready to come on, probably to take one of the spot-kicks."
79',action,"The game is opening up a bit here as Bayala uses his fresh legs to beat his markers for pace and curls his effort towards goal, but Ofori dives to his left to make a fine save. Burkina Faso with another chance to break the deadlock, but Traore fires wide this time."

73',substitution,; Substitution Aristide Bancé Cyrille Bayala
70',substitution,; Substitution Bernard Tekpetey André Ayew Pelé
69',action,"Tekpetey does well to his team a corner on the near side. Mensah however, fails to put it past Koffi with his left foot from inside the box. It was a difficult ball."
67',action,"We're approaching the final 20 minutes of this encounter, and neither team has been able to find the back of the net. Perhaps the introduction of Gyan will help Ghana get into dangerous areas more."

,action,Expect Grant to make some changes in the second 45 minutes. Perhaps the likes of Andre Ayew and Asamoah Gyan will be given a chance. I'm certain that neither coach wants to this encounter to be decided on penalties.

13',action,"Kabore and Badu collide in midfield, but they are both up and ready to resume."
