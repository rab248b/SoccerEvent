,action,"Leganes delivered a spirited display and Garitano will be proud of his men. They stood resilient and for a large part of the game, they managed to keep the hosts at bay. They have a good account of themselves going forward but lacked quality when it came to finishing. The win for Atletico keeps their title hopes alive."
,action,Full time and it ends 2-0 to Atletico. It's a scoreline you'd expect this evening but the performance from Atletico was below par and they need to much better if they are to keep challenging for the title. Greizmann's penalty miss in the first-half summed up the Frenchman's evening and it's no surprised he was hauled off early in the second-half. Torres produced a fine display and was deserving of his brace.
90'+1',action,"There are two minutes of added time to be played here and you can bet that we've seen the last of the action here. Leganes are still searching for a way forward but just can't find a way past the Atletico defence. At the other end of the pitch, the visitors are standing resilient to the hosts and Correa is growing more frustrated as he sees a shot saved by Herrerin."
89',action,"Alberto concedes a free-kick following a foul on Carrasco. Correa takes the set-piece which is in a decent position but he hits straight off the wall and a resulting chance from Carrasco is put out for a corner, much to the frustration of the striker."
88',action,Oh dear! That was the perfect chance for Leganes to pull one back! Machis received it in the centre of the box but failed to hit first time and instead chose to adjust affording the centre-back a chance to clear the danger. The visitors must be more clinical.
85',action,"Atletico are trying to get the ball in the box as they seek a third but the hosts are proving sloppy in the passing and Leganes find them easy to intercept. Machis receives he ball in the attacking third and does well to keep possession under pressure, his cross to Samuel met his teammate's head well but Moya easily got down low to keep the ball out."
82',action,"Machis attempts to win a corner via deflection off Luis but Moya collects it and the hosts are able to take it forward once again. Carrasco picks out Torres who gave it to Correa who's shot come shot looked like it was going in for a second, though it eventually went wide."
79',action,Carrasco does well to hold off Insua who appears to be man handling him before the referee awards a free-kick. The set-piece fails to trouble Leganes but a resulting move almost sees Torres grab his hat-trick. The forward collected the ball on the edge of the box and went to unleash a fierce shot but it was deflected and the resulting corner was poor.
77',substitution,; Erik Morán makes way for Darwin Daniel Machís as we approach the last ten minutes of the game.
76',action,Correa goes close! The substitute hit a low shot from the right of the box after collecting the ball from Juanfran but it's narrowly wide. Atletico are looking more threatening on the attack now.
75',action,"Carrasco puts another decent delivery into the box but it's taken away from the feet of Torres and cleared well by Leganes. Though they are losing, the visitors have certainly put up a good fight and although it will be of little consolation, they can take heart from their performance."
73',substitution,"; Antoine Griezmann, who has performed somewhat under par today, is brought off for Šime Vrsaljko in a double substitution."
72',substitution,; Víctor Díaz Miguel is hauled off in place of Alberto Martín Romo García Adámez.
71',action,Juanfran does well to keep the ball in and cross it in from the wing but narrowly escapes the head of Griezmann before it's put back into the box from Carrasco. Frustrating for Simeone's men as it was a good move. Leganes attempt to hit the hosts on the counter but Samuel's final shot is hit with little precision and is going wide all day long.
68',action,Garitano's men race forward again and go frustratingly close to reducing the two goal deficit. Bustinza latches onto a cross and Godin blocks his attempt. The resulting corner is even more close and Leganes will have no idea how that stayed out! The visitors are getting into all the right positions but aren't proving clinical enough.
65',action,Garcia immediately wins a free-kick following a foul from Juanfran but the set-piece fails to trouble Atletico and is well cut out by Godin. Atletico seem happy to let Leganes pass the all around before intercepting. The visitors win another free-kick which Szymanowski delivers into the area before it's out for a goal-kick.
63',substitution,; Unai López makes way for Samuel García Sánchez in Leganes' first change of the evening.
63',action,Atletico are awarded a free-kick in their own box after Guerrero needlessly brings down Savic. The visitors seem to be growing frustrated now but are still managing to take the game to Atletico in parts. Garitano shouts more orders from the touchline.
62',action,D.Rico looks for a way down the wing before Bustinza collects it on the opposite flank. The ball is eventually whipped into the box but Luis gets a head to it to put it out for a corner. Leganes fail to make anything of the resulting corner and Atletico are able to clear before the visitors retain possession.
59',action,Griezmann looks to link with Carrasco but the attack is well cut by the visitors who attempt to take it forward. Szymanowski is not happy after he appears to be fouled by Juanfran but the referee waves away his protests. Can Leganes find a way back?
57',substitution,; Gaitán makes way for Yannick Ferreira Carrasco. The striker is the side's second top scorer and his six goals and two assists to his name this season.
56',action,Gaitan creates a nice opening for Torres with a clever through ball but the striker is again caught out by the offside flag. Atletico are delivering a much better performance than we seen from in the second-half. Can the Spaniard grab his hat-trick?
54',action,Atletico are happy to pass it around as they seek a way forward. Leganes seem to have been knocked back the goal and are struggling to retain possession. Simeone's men have lost just one home game all season and it doesn't look like that's going to change today.
51',assist,Assist Ángel Martín Correa ; Correa proves that Simeone was right to sub him on with a nice through ball assist.
51',goal,Goal Fernando José Torres Sanz ; GOAL! Torres gets his brace and doubles Atletico's lead. He latched onto the through ball from Correa and managed to nip in between the centre backs and post it past Herrerin. That's the attacking prowess we're used to seeing from Atletico and a goal that will undoubtedly buoy the hosts.
50',action,Lopez fouls Gabi on the edge of the box and the hosts have a free-kick in a dangerous position.  Herrerin arranges his wall and Koke takes but it's poor from the midfielder and he must do better in this situations. It's high and wide and Simeone will not be happy with his man he if keeps that up.
48',action,Luis looks to set Torres away but the offside flag catches the Spaniard out. Will Atletico be able to show their quality and add to the score line or will Leganes stand resilient and continue to frustrate the hosts?
46',substitution,;  Saúl Ñíguez makes way for Ángel Martín Correa at the break.
46',action,The sides are back out and the hosts gets us underway for the remaining 45-minutes...
,action,Atletico have had more chances but have failed to really threaten Leganes excluding the goal. The visitors will rue conceding a penalty as that's the only time the hosts have looked like scoring. It was a poor hit from the spot by Griezmann and he will thankful to Torres for tucking away the rebound. You'd expect better from the Frenchman who is the side's top scorer with eight goals and four assists so far this season.
,action,The two sides head in the break with Atletico leading by one goal. It's been a pretty quiet first-half and there isn't too many chances to report. Leganes have gave a good account of themselves and they really are showing they have the fight to survive in La Liga. Guerrero in particular has been lively for the visitors who have proved tough to breakdown.
44',action,"Juanfran is down and looks in pain following a challenge from D.Rico, though the Atletico man looks okay to continute and the hosts have a free-kick on the right wing a few yards outside of the box. The set-piece is well dealt with by the visitors and Garitano screams instructions to his men from the touchline."
43',action,"Torres brings down Insua and the defender is awarded a free-kick on the edge of his own box. Herrerin hoofs it up the field and the ball ends up in the hands of Moya. Simeone will be frustrated by the lack of attacking prowess shown from his side, particularly Griezmann who has been somewhat anonymous following the goal."
40',action,Torres is down and grimacing following a foul from Bustinza who escapes unpunished. Atletico use the free-kick as an opportunity to compose themselves and pass the ball around their half. The home fans are urging their side on.
39',action,"And again! Lopez creates a move for himself and races forward before hitting it from just outside the box, however, his attempt has too much power on and sails well over the bar. Leganes are certainly giving it a good go."
38',action,CLOSE! Legnes almost level as Diaz unleashes a fierce shot from the right side of the box but it's across the face of goal and wide. The visitors are certainly showing their worth and Guerrero seems to be involved in their every move.
36',action,"Szymanowski races in to try and create something but fails to do so, though you have to hand credit to the visitors for attempting to take the game to a strong Atletico side. Herrerin spots the danger early and races out of his box to clear before Torres is able to latch onto it. The tempo of the game seems to have died down following the penalty."
33',action,The free-kick is poorly taken and fails to trouble Moya in the slightest. Atletico pass the ball around their over half for a moment or two as they look for a way to break a resilient Leganes down. The ball is hit to Niguez and he does well to keep it in but has no-one supporting him and the hosts again pass the ball around their own half.
32',yellow-card,Yellow Card Stefan Savić ; Stefan Savić is placed in the referee's book for a foul on Szymanowski.
31',action,"The free-kick is well dealt with by Leganes who have put up a good fight so far. The visitors will be disappointed to be behind as nothing has really separated the two sides. The hosts look to take it forward again, with Juanfran running down the right wing proving to a popular method for them but the move fizzles out as his teammate is flagged offside."
30',yellow-card,Yellow Card Erik Morán Arribas ; Erik Morán receives the first yellow card of the afternoon for a foul on Gaitan.
29',action,Guerrero is causing Atletico a number of problems in the attacking third and it takes a combination of Savic and Juanfran to stop the forward. Atletico are able to get it forward but Torres is again beaten to the ball by a blue shirt. Moments later Gaitan wins a free-kick on the left following a foul from Moran.
26',action,"Juanfran gives it to Koke who takes it to the left wing. Gaitan looks for Torres but the forward can't reach the cross in time and it's out for a goalkick. Though they are front, Atletico haven't impressed too much as of yet. A Leganes corner reaches Bueno who attempts an audacious hit but it's off Juanfran and out for another corner. The Atletico man seems to have been winded by the deflection but is okay to continue and the corner is well cleared."
23',action,"Juanfran and Gaitan link up well but Leganes retain possession, though their attack is shortlived as the home defence cut it out. Guerrero continues to be lively as he looks to take advantage of a Godin mistake but the ball has too much pace for him to reach it. The forward is certainly getting into the positions."
21',action,"Following Barcelona's 3-0 rout earlier today, it's important Atletico don't let this lead slip as they need to stay level on points with their league rivals if they are to stay in the title race. Leganes win a free-kick following a foul from Juanfran but it's in awkward position and Lopez puts it well wide."
18',action,Atletico are enjoying the lion's share of possession now they are ahead and have found their tempo. They're beginning to dominate as Gaitan looks to get a cross in but it's well defended. Moments later Torres attempts a theatrical hit but it's wasteful from the Spaniard and the visitors have a goalkick.
15',penalty-save,Penalty save Iago Herrerín Buisán ; SAVE! Herrerín will be disappointed his side are behind after starting the game well. The 'keeper did well to save the penalty but parried it which gave Torress the chance to nip in and score.
15',goal,Goal Fernando José Torres Sanz ; GOAL! Fernando Torres spared Griezmann's blushes and competently tucked away the rebound to give the hosts the lead.
15',missed-penalty,Missed Penalty Antoine Griezmann ; PENALTY! Siovas concedes a penalty and Antoine Griezmann misses! You'd bet your bottom dollar that the in demand Frenchman would score from the spot but he goes straight down the middle Herrerin saves.
13',action,"Atletico seek a way forward but Leganes are affording the hosts little space and are forced to take it back. Guerrero looks to exploit a mistake from the hosts but they win it back immediately. The visitors are putting up a good fight thus far and if this opening performance is anything to go by, they may just survive the drop."
11',action,The hosts take a minute to pass it around their own half as they look to find their tempo. Simeone is urging his men take it forward and they do but the cross is overhit and a frustrated Simeone barks more orders. Moments later Niguez wins a free-kick in his own half following a foul from the seemingly lively Guerrero.
8',action,Saul goes agonsignly close to grabbing that opening goal for Atletico. The midfielder struck it from just outside the box but his effort sailed just inches wide. Moments later Leganes had a chance to take the lead but Moya spotted the cross well and Guerrero was unable to get there first. An eventful opening few minutes in terms of attack.
5',action,Asier Garitano calls for composure from his men as they struggle to retain possession. A cross to Guerrero is over-hit but it's a promising sign for the visitors who are searching for their first victory of 2017. At the other end of the pitch Torres concedes a foul and Leganes have the ball back in the Atletico half.
2',action,Torres very nearly gets an early opener for Atletico after going it alone having collected the ball from Griezmann and shoots from the edge of the box but his attempted chip is mishit and it's well wide. A let off for Leganes as you'd expect the forward to be for clinical in those situations.
1',action,The visitor's get us underway for this evening's fixture...
,action,"Atletico have made more than a few changes to the side that lost to Barcelona during the week. Filipe, Gabi, Saul, Gaitan and Torres are all back in the starting eleven as Diego Simeone seems to place a lot of emphasis on attack. There a number of changes to the Leganes side that lost to Celta Vigo as V,Ruiz, Bustinza, Siovas and Bueno all return to the fold."

,action,TEAM NEWS
,action,"Currently residing in 17th place, Leganes are flirting with relegation, though Asier Garitano will take some comfort in the five gap between his side and the relegation zone. The newly promoted side are struggling in LaLiga and are without a win in a whole ten games and there aren’t many harder places to pick up three points than the Vicente Calderon. The last time the sides met was 2001 when Atletico ran out 1-0 winners."
,action,The hosts will be hurting following their 2-1 defeat to Barcelona in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final and Leganes will be wary of a backlash. Diego Simeone’s men are currently fourth in LaLiga and on an unbeaten run of five games. Their last loss in the league came back in December when they were comfortably beaten 3-0 away to Villarreal. A win today would fail to seem them move higher in the table but it could help to reduce the deficit against third-placed Sevilla and second-placed Barcelona who are level on 42 points.
