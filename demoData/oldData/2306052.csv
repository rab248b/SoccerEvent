,action,"In the end, it was a relatively comfortable evening for Juventus, who, bar a couple of nervy moments at the start of the second half, easily dealt with the little that Chievo were able to throw at them. At the other end, Dybala and Higuain were in inspired form, resulting in two more goals for the in-form striker to increase his side's lead at the top of the table to nine points ahead of Roma's game tomorrow."
,action,FULL-TIME: JUVENTUS 2-0 CHIEVO
90'+3',action,"Lovely play by Juventus! The home side move the ball around beautifully as they push forward on one last attack. Sandro skips into the box and picks out Higuain, who then tees up Khedira with a wonderful flick, but the German is unable to wrap up the move with a goal as his shot is well saved by Seculin."
90'+2',action,"Sandro is out-muscled by Inglese midway down the right wing and loses out to the substitute. The Chievo man breaks forward quickly before lifting a cross over to Pellissier, but the striker is unable to reach the ball with his head and loses out to Bonucci."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be three minutes of added time.
88',action,"No, they can't. Birsa steps up and unleashes a curling shot from the set-piece but it's slightly too powerful and fails to hit the target."
87',action,"Pellissier, who has seen little of the ball since the start of the second half, picks up possession just outside of the penalty area before being fouled from behind by Barzagli, resulting in a free-kick for Chievo just a couple of yards outside of the box. Can they make it count with a late goal?"
85',substitution,"; Juventus have made their final change, with Lichtsteiner making way for Dani Alves."
84',assist,"Assist Stephan Lichtsteiner ; Lichtsteiner picked out Higuain with a nice pass across the face of goal, but that goal was all about Dybala, who comfortably skipped past several players on his way towards goal."

He then pokes the ball out to Lichtsteiner, who quickly pokes it over to Higuain, and the Argentine is easily able to rifle a shot into the back of the net to wrap up the win for Juventus."
83',action,"Chievo are doing well to put Juventus under pressure as they try to find a late equaliser, but they're leaving space available behind whenever they push forward. Juventus are clearly looking to hit them on the break, and that could end up hurting the visitors if they're not too careful."
81',action,"Chance for Birsa! The Juventus defence seems to have fallen asleep slightly, allowing Chievo to push plenty of bodies forward. They do so really well before Birsa unleashes a thumping half-volley from the edge of the box, but it's well saved by Buffon in the middle of the goal."
79',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Leonardo Bonucci ; Bonucci isn't at all happy with the referee about one of his decisions, and he receives a yellow card for dissent that will keep him out of his side's next game."
78',action,"Sandro links up well with Dybala over on the left wing before cutting into the penalty area. He skips past one player before taking on Cesar, but he's unable to find a way past the centre-back and it out-muscled on the byline."
76',action,"What a miss by Higuain! Dybala cuts inside from the right wing and fires a beautiful pass straight into the feet of Higuain. The striker's first touch is beautiful and sets him up perfectly to make it 2-0, but he fires his effort just wide of the near post. He really should have buried that!"

72',substitution,"; Juventus have made a defensive substitution, with Sturaro making way for Leonardo Bonucci. It looks as if the home side are going to switch to playing with three at the back."
71',action,"Lemina bursts down the right wing on an excellent run as he easily skips past Cacciatore. He then sprints towards the edge of the penalty area before trying to tee up Lichtsteiner with a deft flick, but the Swiss defender misreads the attempted move and lets it roll right past him."
70',action,"Higuain bursts into the left-hand side of the Chievo penalty area and does well to knock the ball back to Sturaro. The midfielder is in a good position and quickly shoots, but it's closed down and fails to trouble Seculin."
68',action,"A nice exchange of passes from Chievo deep inside the Juventus half of the pitch ends with Izco 30 yards away from goal. He takes a quick touch and then unleashes a rocket of a shot, but Sturaro is there to throw his body in the way of the effort."

61',action,"Thumping strike by Higuain! A lofted pass forward should be comfortably dealt with by Spolli, but the defender's attempted headed clearance spins up in the air and down to Higuain. The striker controls it well before spinning and shooting, and his rocket of a strike flies just past the far post after leaving Seculin rooted to the spot."
59',action,"Sandro does well to skip into the left-hand side of the Chievo penalty area before trying to cut a pass back to Higuain, but he's unable to make decent contact with the ball and loses out to Spolli."

54',action,"Dybala is presented with another chance to score, but this time his half-volley from the edge of the penalty area is deflected out for a corner. It's sent short and worked over to Sandro, whose chipped pass into the box is poor and sails straight into the hands of Seculin."

Izco gets himself into a pocket of space midway inside the Juventus half of the pitch over on the right wing and quickly curls a dangerous cross into the box, where it finds Meggiorini.

40',action,"A swinging cross from the right wing causes a few scares for the Juventus back line, who are just about able to clear the ball for a corner. The set-piece is curled back into the box and towards the near post, but Marchisio is there to thump the ball away from danger."
38',action,"Valter Birsa, who has seen little of the ball so far, receives possession in a pocket of space not far outside of the Juventus box. He spins quickly and shoots, but his long-range strike is well blocked on the edge of the penalty area."
36',action,"Dybala receives the ball from Lichtsteiner over on the right wing and immediately fires a lovely lofted pass over to the left flank, where Higuain quickly wins Juventus a corner. It's taken by Dybala but fails to find a team-mate due to the Argentine slipping as he makes contact with the ball."
34',action,"Juventus seem content to allow Chievo plenty of time on the ball, as they have no problem sitting deep and soaking up the pressure. So far, the visitors have struggled to cause too many issues for the home side, leaving Buffon largely a spectator in the middle of the goal."

,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this evening…"
,action,"Juventus were made to work hard in last season’s corresponding fixture, with Paulo Dybala having to dispatch a late penalty to cancel out Perparim Hetemaj’s early opener. Chievo boast a surprisingly decent record in this part of Turin, where they’ve held the Old Lady to draws on three separate occasions in the last six meetings between the two teams."
,action,"Thanks to an impressive season on a modest budget, Chievo currently sit comfortably in 11th place and are in no danger whatsoever of facing a potential scrap to avoid relegation. They find themselves on a slightly disappointing run though, as both Bologna and Crotone managed to get the better of the Gialloblu in their last two outings, meaning that they have just one win from four games heading into tonight’s tough clash."
,action,"It’s understandable that Juventus have one eye on Tuesday evening’s Champions League clash at home to Barcelona, so they’ll be looking to get past Chievo without too many problems - or injuries. The league leaders shouldn’t have too many issues though, as since the defeat against Fiorentina midway through January, they’ve collected 29 points from a possible 33."
,action,"A nervy and exciting 1-1 draw with Napoli last weekend means that Juventus’ lead at the top of the Serie A table now sits at six points, with Roma, who have won their last three consecutive league games, trying their hardest to chase down the reigning champions. A win here against mid-table Chievo would be a much-needed result, despite it looking unlikely that anyone will be able to catch the in-form Old Lady."
,action,Good evening and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Serie A game between Juventus and Chievo at the Juventus Stadium.
