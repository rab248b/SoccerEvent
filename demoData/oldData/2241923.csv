,action,FULL-TIME: MIDDLESBROUGH 3-0 SWANSEA CITY
90'+3',action,That's it! The referee ends the contest.
90'+2',action,"CHANCE! Forshaw almost capitalises on a late mistake between Mawson and Fabianski, but he gets crowded out before he can fire at goal."
90'+1',action,"BLOCK! Boro are hanging on to this clean sheet as Montero blasts a low strike towards the bottom corner, but again Gibson makes an important block."
90',yellow-card,Yellow Card Álvaro Negredo Sánchez ; Negredo is booked for a foul on Fulton.
90',action,There will be three minutes of added time.
90',action,"SAVE! Valdes preserves his clean sheet by making a fine one-handed save to deny Llorente at the back post. The Spaniard had beaten Friend at the back post and powered his header at goal, but the keeper was there to make the stop."
88',action,Sigurdsson sends his effort just wide of the post following another good forward burst. Karanka will be desperate for his team to hold out for a clean sheet.
87',substitution,; Fabio makes way late in the game for Traore.
86',action,"WIDE! Sigurdsson beats two challenges and raids to the edge of the area, but can only fire his strike narrowly wide of the post."
84',action,"CHANCE! From the resulting corner, Boro clear the danger and break through Fabio. The Brazilian tees up Friend on a surge alongside him, but the defender can only lift his effort over the bar."
83',action,"BLOCK! Boro maintain their clean sheet thanks to an important block from Gibson. He didn't know a great deal about Fer's strike from the edge of the box, but he was in the right place in the right time to stop the goalbound effort."
81',action,Boro are in clock-kllling mode at the moment. Karanka will just be hopeful that his players can avoid injuries at this stage with a busy schedule over Christmas on the horizon.
79',action,"Downing wastes an opening to strike at goal, but he turns again before rifling a left-footed strike at goal. However, Amat is there to divert the ball behind for a corner."
78',action,"This has been a professional performance from Middlesbrough, built on the strength of their backline who have been excellent this afternoon."
77',substitution,; Montero replaces Routledge for the visitors.
75',action,"Gibson takes the ball into traffic in the middle of the pitch, but after losing possession Clayton bails him out by winning the ball back with a good challenge."
73',action,Boro just have to see this victory out. They've been solid through the middle for the majority of the contest and only to have to maintain that discipline for another 17 minutes.
71',action,"Swansea work the ball well around the middle of the park before Amat seizes possession in the centre circle. He is allowed to drive forward, but he opts to shoot rather than pick out a team-mate, dragging his strike well wide of the post."
70',substitution,; Fer replaces Britton in the middle of the park for the Swans.
68',action,"OVER! Chances at both ends now as Mawson rises to head Sigurdsson's cross from the left at goal, but he gets too much height on his effort, sending it over the bar."
67',action,"WIDE! Gibson attacks a free-kick from the left from Downing's boot, but he can only direct his header wide of the post."
65',action,"BLOCK! Barragan makes a vital block at the back to stop Baston getting a goal back for the Swans. The Spaniard had latched on to Routledge's cross and fired at goal, but his compatriot made a sliding challenge to deny him."
64',action,"OVER! Routledge sends a looping cross into the box for the run of Llorente, but he can only guide his header over the bar."
62',substitution,; More good news for Boro as Friend makes a step forward on the comeback trail from injury as he replaces Ramirez.
61',action,"Britton sends a deep pass looking for Llorente in the box, but Chambers has him well covered, allowing Valdes to gather with ease."
59',substitution,; Barrow has had a game to forget and makes way for Baston.
58',assist,Assist Gastón Exequiel Ramírez Pereyra ; Ramirez produces a peach of a cross to allow De Roon to score from close range.
58',goal,"Goal Marten de Roon ; GOAL!!!! BORO HAVE THREE! That is surely game over now as the home side notch their third of the game with De Roon converting from close range. Ramirez was the architect as he swung a pinpoint cross into the box, allowing the Dutchman to finish with ease."
56',action,"The Swans are definitely making life tougher for the home side since the restart. They're dominating possession, but have lacked any penetration in the final third."
54',action,"Routledge makes a break down the right flank and has space to lift the ball to the back post, but Barragan an important intervention to beat Barrow in the air and clear the danger."
52',action,"SHOT! Forshaw is allowed to surge to the edge of the box unchallenged and he fires an effort at goal, only to blaze his strike over the bar."
50',action,"Boro gift the ball back to the visitors from a free-kick and Sigurdsson breaks. However, his attempted throughball for Llorente hits the Spaniard's ankles, and the midfielder is forced to go alone in the box, and eventually loses possession."
48',action,"Again the Swans have come out of the blocks well, but are yet to test Valdes with a meaningful effort at goal."
46',action,"Swansea go straight on the attack and win a corner, but Sigurdsson's cross is punched clear by Valdes."
46',action,We're back underway at the Riverside Stadium.
,action,"The players are back out for the second half, so we should be underway again shortly."
,action,"Middlesbrough hold a comfortable 2-0 lead at the break over Swansea City without playing that well. Two goals from Alvaro Nedgredo, including one from the penalty spot have handed the home side a healthy advantage over their relegation rivals to put Aitor Karanka's men on course for a vital win."
,action,HALF-TIME: MIDDLESBROUGH 2-0 SWANSEA CITY
45'+4',action,The referee brings the half to an end.
45'+3',action,"No he cannot as the home side clear his first cross and after a bit of  uncertain bounce from the follow-up, Valdes is able to claim."
45'+2',action,The Swans have a late opportunity to pile men forward in the box from a Sigurdsson free-kick. Can the midfielder produce a quality delivery here?
45',action,There will be three minutes of added time and more could be tacked on due to Mawson's injury.
45',action,"Negredo collects a cross in the box and tries an acrobatic overhead kick for his hat-trick, but only connects with Mawson's head. The Swansea defender is down and in need of treatment before the break."
43',action,"Barrow collects on the right flank and then switches to his left foot to curl a dangerous cross into the box, but not a single white shirt attacks the ball as it drifts wide of the post."
42',action,The referee blows for another foul but this time against the visitors as Mawson pushes Chambers in the back before heading an effort at goal.
41',action,Fabio slides into the back of Barrow and the visitors have a free-kick just inside the Boro half. A goal back before half time would certainly liven up this contest.
39',action,"A heart-stopping moment for Barragan he and Fulton go down in a heap in the box, but the official awards a free-kick to the home side."
38',action,"Swansea are enjoying their best period of the game since going behind, but the home side are keeping their play in front of their box."
36',action,"Rangel plays two neat passes into Fulton in the box, but the first attempt is well blocked by Forshaw and the second is turned behind by Chambers."
34',action,"Barrow gets in behind the Middlesbrough defence and slots the ball into the net, but the referee's whistle had gone long before. The winger was well offside when he colleted Llorente's pass."
33',action,Middlesbrough are in complete control of proceedings at the moment. A stark contrast from the opening five minutes when they were all over the place.
31',action,"Better intensity from the Swans in the final third as Sigurdsson opens his body to strike at goal, only for Gibson to make a vital block on the edge of the box."
29',penalty-goal,"Penalty Goal Álvaro Negredo Sánchez ; GOAL!!!! NEGREDO NOTCHES HIS SECOND! The Spaniard keeps his composure from the spot as he strokes the ball into the bottom corner, sending Fabianski the wrong way."
28',action,PENALTY TO MIDDLESBROUGH!  Forshaw is sent flying in the box by Amat and the referee points the spot on the advice of his assistant.
26',action,"Fabianski claims Downing's corner with ease, allowing Routledge to breathe a sigh of relief."
26',action,Routledge produces a bizarre backpass to Fabianski as he slams the ball out of a play for a corner. The winger will be hopeful that nothing comes from the set-piece.
24',action,Middlesbrough have settled since taking the lead and are being far more assertive in their play now. Bradley needs a response from his team.
23',action,"OVER! Ramirez strikes his effort at goal and gets the ball over the wall, but it just does not have enough dip to get under the bar, sailing inches over."
21',action,"Ramirez is caught on the edge of the box by Rangel and the home side have a free-kick in a threatening position, which the Uruguayan will take."
20',action,Swansea's side-to-side passing is leading them nowhere down the pitch and Boro are looking dangerous on the counter.
18',assist,Assist Adam Clayton ; Clayton does extremely well on the flank to beat Rangel before finding Negredo with his left-footed cross.
18',goal,"Goal Álvaro Negredo Sánchez ; GOALLLL!! BORO TAKE THE LEAD! The home side are ahead as Ramirez wins the ball in the middle of the park before feeding Clayton. He does well on the flank to beat Rangel to send a cross into the box. Negredo needs only touch to bury his left-footed effort on the half-volley past Fabianski, with a sublime finish."
16',action,"Sigurdsson floats a cross in from the right and Llorente challenges with Gibson in the box, but the Boro skipper heads the ball clear. England boss Gareth Southgate is in the stands this afternoon and Gibson will be desperate to impress."
15',action,"The frenetic pace of the early mintutes has abated, allowing the home side to settle into the contest."
13',action,"Middlesbrough appear to have stifled Swansea's early press. The visitors came out the blocks like Usain Bolt, but have been slowed since by the home side."
12',substitution,; Downing comes on to replace the injured Fischer.
10',action,Fischer hits the deck again and this time it looks as through he will not be able to continue.
9',action,"CHANCE! Fischer gets back on his feet and Boro go on the attack as Barragan lifts a cross towards the back post and Negredo pulls off his man. He fires a left-footed strike towards the bottom corner, but Fabianski makes the save before Amat clears the rebound."
7',action,Fischer pulls up out of nowhere and requires treatment on the pitch before we can continue here.
6',action,Better pressing from Middlesbrough forces Swansea back towards their own goal with Forshaw leading the charge. Karanka will not be pleased with how his side have started the game as he paces on the edge of the technical area.
4',action,"Boro are all over the place at the back in the early stages as Gibson lets the ball bounce in the box before Barrow's cross is headed clear, allowing the hosts to come away from their penalty area."
3',action,"CHANCE! The Boro defence back off Sigurdsson and invite the strike from the midfielder. He blasts the ball towards the top corner and only a fine save from Valdes denies the Swansea man, turning the ball past the post."
3',action,"Barrow spurns his second opening in the space of a minute as Sigurdsson plays the ball into his path at the back post, but he misses the ball completely and lets the home side off the hook."
2',action,"Llorente heads the ball into space for Barrow to collect. The winger has space ahead of him to raid, but his pass across the edge of the box is cut out by Gibson."
1',action,We're underway at the Riverside Stadium.
,action,"The players are making their way out on to the pitch, so we should be underway shortly."
,action,"Bradley has also made one change, reverting back to the team that beat Sunderland last week. Modou Barrow replaces Jefferson Montero in the team, with the latter dropping to the bench this afternoon."
,action,"Karanka has made one change from his side that were beaten by Liverpool. Adama Traore drops out of the side and is replaced by Gaston Ramirez, who joins Alvaro Negredo and Viktor Fischer as part of the front three."
,action,"Swansea subs: Van der Hoorn, Fer, Baston, Nordfeldt, Montero, Naughton, Cork."
,action,"SWANSEA CITY (4-2-3-1): Fabianski; Rangel, Mawson, Amat, Taylor; Fulton, Britton; Barrow, Sigurdsson, Routledge; Llorente."
,action,"Middlesbrough subs: Friend, Espinosa, Leadbitter, Rhodes, Guzan, Downing, Traore."
,action,"MIDDLESBROUGH (4-3-3): Valdes; Barragan, Chambers, Gibson, Fabio; Forshaw, Clayton, De Roon; Fischer, Negredo, Ramirez."
,action,The team news has been announced and we'll start with the home side.
,action,Swansea failed to build in their impressive 3-0 win over Sunderland last week as they were beaten 3-1 by West Brom at The Hawthorns. Bob Bradley's men cannot continue to keep dropping points to the teams around them in the Premier League and will need at least a point this afternoon to maintain their survival hopes.
,action,"Aitor Karanka's men dropped perilously close to the relegation zone and are only clear of the bottom three by three points, although that could change today with a defeat at the hands of the Swans, who could draw level with the North East outfit."
,action,"Boro are in need of a response this afternoon after they were taken apart during the week by Liverpool. The Reds were rampant at the Riverside, claiming a 3-0 win with ease."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to the live commentary of the Premier League clash between Middlesbrough and Swansea City at the Riverside Stadium.
