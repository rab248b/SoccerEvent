,action,"And that's a wrap from Selhurst Park, with Palace clinching a vital 3-0 victory to break a long losing streak. Southampton were suffering from an EFL Cup hangover, as they were well below their best. Goals from Benteke, either side of a Tomkins strike, did the damage for the hosts. That's all the time we've got, thanks for tuning in!"
90'+1',action,"It's been touch for Palace to take the six defeats in a row that preceded this game. Pardew was under immense pressure coming into this one, but this result will be a massive boost to the confidence of him and his team."
89',substitution,"; Tomkins is also withdrawn, and on comes Kelly."
89',substitution,; Late appearance here for Mathieu Flamini in place of McArthur.
88',action,"Crystal Palace continue to pile on the goals in the Premier League - that's 24 in 14 games now. What Pardew will want the most at this stage is a clean sheet, because they've also conceded 26 in that time."
85',assist,"Assist Jason Puncheon ; He held his position wide, coming infield at the right time."
85',goal,"Goal Christian Benteke Liolo ; IT'S THREE FOR PALACE! Puncheon keeps his own corner alive, and his return cross is headed by Van Dijk to McArthur, who releases Puncheon to square for Benteke to tap it home!"
83',action,"Southampton work a cross to the back post, where Long steals a march on Ward to flick a header back into contention, but it's cleared away from danger. Not long left for them to get a goal now."
81',action,"The ball continues to be camped around the Palace penalty area as Southampton win their ninth corner of the game, which comes to nothing. A goal at this stage would make things very interesting."
80',substitution,; Townsend has been withdrawn for Bakary Sako.
79',action,"HOW HAVE SOUTHAMPTON NOT SCORED? Ward-Prowse's powerful header from a corner is flicked onto the crossbar by Van Dijk. The ball is still alive, and is worked to the onrushing Fonte, who side-foots it off the mark from 12 yards!"
77',action,"SMART SAVE! Cedric sneaks a cross in to the near post where Long gets ahead of Delaney to plant a header on target, but Hennessey gets down low to make a quite commendable save!"
76',substitution,; McQueen comes on to replace Austin.
76',substitution,; Long is introduced for Boufal.
75',action,"Boufal and Fonte try to link on the left-hand side, with the defender trying his luck from 30 yards. Palace will be delighted to see the central defender have a go, it means that Southampton are running out of options."
72',action,"A Palace clearance is poor, and the Saints keep it alive in the opposition defensive third. Boufal strides forward before laying the ball off to Bertrand, who hammers it goalwards but the keeper is all over it."
70',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Christian Benteke Liolo ; Benteke is a little too eager when wrestling for the ball with a defender, and gets booked."
70',action,"Afraid that there's not much happening on the pitch at the moment, with Palace quite happy to let Southampton have the majority of the ball and pack their own half to frustrate the visiting side."
67',action,"I'm surprised that Shane Long is still on the bench for the visitors. He could provide an additional threat running the channels, particularly with Palace starting to hold more players back in their own half."
65',action,"The visitors have belatedly begun to throw numbers forward, although there's a distinct lack of quality in the final ball. Their attacking players like Boufal seem indecisive on the ball."
63',action,"BETTER FROM SOUTHAMPTON! Cedric flings a dangerous cross into the six-yard area and Austin gets to the near post ahead of Dann, but his flick ends up going nowhere special."
61',action,"HANDBALL? Palace fail to clear after a period of Southampton pressure, and Ward-Prowse whacks the ball into the body of McArthur in the box. The referee correctly waves play on as Cedric hammers a rebound into the sky."
59',substitution,"; Joshua Sims, who made an impressive cameo against Arsenal, is on for Hojbjerg."
58',action,"Palace are starting to sit back a little more, clearly playing on the counter, confident in their ability to pick off loose Southampton passes and spark themselves on the break. Almost an hour gone."
56',action,Southampton have not made enough of an effort in the second half to show that they deserve a way back into this game. They've allowed Palace to have too much of the ball in their own half.
55',yellow-card,Yellow Card James McArthur ; McArthur is the latest player to go into the book after he got tangled with Romeu.
53',action,"Palace almost execute a lovely move down the left-hand side with a series of flicks and hold-ups, but Townsend just about fails to keep the ball in play. This is so much better from the home side."
51',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Charlie Austin ; Austin tries to get the better of Ledley, but only ends up fouling him. Yellow card."
50',action,"OVER THE TOP! Boufal went fo power instead of placement and it probably cost his team a goal. A low cross found him arriving at the back post, but he hammered it well above the crossbar."
48',action,"Easy take for Forster as Palace try to get around the back post. The home side have started the second period on song. A third goal, you feel, will wrap this match up as a contest."
46',action,Off we go again!
,action,The referee ends the first-half as Palace take a 2-0 lead into the break. Two goals in as many minutes from Benteke and Tomkins have presented them with a handsome advantage. Southampton will be ruing their lapses at the back as there's been little in this other than that fateful spell.
45'+1',action,"Ward-Prowse gets the ball to Austin, who flicks it into the path of Redmond, who tries his best to get a shot away, but the angle was against him as he blasts it over. Not long left now in the half."
44',action,"Delaney hoists in the free-kick that's flicked into the path of Puncheon, whose half-volley is planted into a defender. He scored a cracker at St Mary's last season, although it ended up being only consolation."
42',action,"Cedric gets the cross in but Dann, who has been solid so far, makes the initial interception. Palace can't get it beyond Boufal though, who shifts onto his right foot and fires an effort down the throat of the keeper."
40',action,"Now Southampton have no choice but to come out of their shell. Redmond tries to make something happen with a searching ball over the top, but Hennessey makes a strong claim."
37',yellow-card,"Yellow Card James Tomkins ; Fresh off his goal, Tomkins gets his name taken for bodying Redmond."
36',goal,"Goal James Tomkins ; PALACE HAVE A SECOND! Once again, it's dreadful defending from Southampton. A low corner is flicked right into the centre of the six-yard area. Forster is rooted to his line, and Tomkins arrives to clean up!"
35',action,"Perfect way for Benteke to celebrate his birthday, and he's now scored his first at Selhurst Park, with all five of his other goals coming away from home. That was a terrible howler."
33',goal,"Goal Christian Benteke Liolo ; THANK YOU VERY MUCH! An absolute gift of an opener. Fonte's pass back to Forster appears to be routine, but the ball bobbles off his standing leg as he swings for the clearance. Benteke pouncs in to score!"
31',action,"A more even tempo developing to the game, with Palace getting bodies forward whenever the ball goes down the flanks. Southampton are being forced back to Forster regularly."
28',action,"There's been a distinct lack of intensity so far, but of course, a goal either way could change that in a hurry. Zaha tries to apply some pressure with a cross, but Forster scoops it up and sets Nathan Redmond on his bike with a lovely throw."
26',action,"MUCH BETTER FROM PALACE! Andros Townsend spots a lovely pass down the right for Zaha, who lifts it into the area first-time. Benteke arrives in the area, but is off the mark with his header."
24',action,"Palace fans groan every time their team has to defend a corner or dead ball. They've conceded 13 times from set-piece scenarios in 2016-17, after letting in only 11 for the entirety of 2015-16."
21',action,"NARROWLY WIDE OF THE MARK! Bertrand holds his heads in his hands after a snap-shot from the edge of the box took a deflection before flashing the wrong side of the post, with Wayne Hennessey rooted to the spot."
19',action,"Southampton are starting to apply more pressure, and the fans are unhappy with what they're seeing from Crystal Palace. They're playing as if they're protecting a lead late on in the game."
17',action,"Boufal decides to take matters into his own hands, spinning away from James Tomkins while holding him off. That gives him space for a shot, but it's quickly closed down by Scott Dann, who makes the block."
14',action,"Rather underwhelming opening quarter of an hour, with neither side coming remotely close to presenting a threat in the opposition penalty area. Puel will be the happier manager though."
12',action,"Jason Puncheon squares the ball to Wilfried Zaha on the right-hand side, and he tries to take the long way around Boufal, whose attempt at stopping the danger is to concede a free-kick."
10',action,Southampton haven't quite been able to match up to their fast start against Everton last weekend where they scored inside the opening 45 seconds - which ended up being the only goal of the game.
8',action,"Palace are resorting to punts forward to Christian Benteke a little too early for my liking. The Belgian is certainly capable of playing that way, but he needs his teammates to gamble in support."
6',action,"Palace have been among the goals this season, but they face one of the best central defences in the top flight. Jose Fonte and Virgil van Dijk have been winning many admires for their play."
3',action,"Positive start for the visiting side, with a lot of touches for the likes of Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg on the flanks. The home side just have to be careful that they don't surrender too much possession."
1',action,Off we go!
,action,"Claude Puel returns a host of his regulars after the cup victory against Arsenal. Jose Fonte and Charlie Austin are back in the team, with the stars of that Gunners win, Ryan Bertrand and Soufiane Boufal, also present."
,action,"Connor Wickham and Steve Mandanda will both go under the knife to deal with knee problems, and miss out this weekend, while Yohan Cabaye is suspended. Joe Ledley is recalled to the team, with Christian Benteke leading the line."
,action,"Southampton subs: Yoshida, Clasie, Long, Davis, Taylor, McQueen, Sims."
,action,"Southampton (4-3-3): Forster; Cedric, Van Dijk, Fonte, Bertrand; Ward-Prowse, Romeu, Hojbjerg; Redmond, Austin, Boufal."
,action,"Crystal Palace subs: Speroni, Flamini, Campbell, Lee, Fryers, Sako, Kelly."
,action,"Crystal Palace (4-2-3-1): Hennessey; Tomkins, Dann, Delaney, Ward; McArthur, Ledley; Townsend, Puncheon, Zaha; Benteke."
,action,"Southampton are in 10th place, but with 15 goals conceded boast one of the better defensive records in the top flight, with only four other teams letting in less. They're also into the last four of the EFL Cup after beating Arsenal 2-0 at the Emirates."
,action,"Alan Pardew's side have been flirting dangerously with the relegation zone after losing their last six games. One thing that hasn't been a problem for them is goals, with 21 scored in 13 games - only the sides in the top four have a better attacking record."
,action,"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Premier Leauge match between Crystal Palace and Southampton. The hosts have dropped six straight, and welcome a side who just knocked Arsenal out of the EFL Cup."
