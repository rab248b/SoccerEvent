,action,"Two goals in the dying minutes from Arturo Vidal and Arjen Robben saw Bayern Munich turn a draw into a dramatic victory - moving them seven points clear at the top of the Bundesliga. The final score was harsh on the struggling Ingolstadt, who gallantly held their own for 90 minutes, but were made to pay for that slight lapse in concentration that allowed Vidal to break the deadlock."
,action,FULL-TIME: INGOLSTADT 0-2 BAYERN MUNICH
90'+3',action,There goes the final whistle and Bayern have the three points!
90'+1',assist,"Assist Douglas Costa de Souza ; Costa returned the ball to Robben, who brilliantly executed a neat one-two with the Brazilian."
90'+1',goal,"Goal Arjen Robben ; ROBBEN MAKES IT TWO!!! You spend a whole match waiting for a goal and then two come along at once! Robben puts the game beyond Ingolstadt as he embarks on a darting run from the wing and exchanges passes with Costa, before drilling the ball beyond the dive of Hansen."
90',assist,Assist Thomas Müller ; Müller provided the assist with a wonderful ball into the box.
90',goal,Goal Arturo Erasmo Vidal Pardo ; VIDAL!!! BAYERN WINNER!!! Heartbreak for Ingolstadt! The hosts' resolve is finally broken in the dying seconds at the Audi Sportpark! An unmarked Vidal drifts into the area to calmly guide Muller's cross away from Hansen and into the corner.
89',substitution,; Leckie is replaced by Anthony Jung as Ingolstadt look to shore things up at the back.
88',action,"The league leaders are continuing to press, but just cannot find a way through their stubborn opponents as the clock continues to tick down."
85',action,Time is running out for Bayern Munich at the Audi Sportpark! They are five minutes away from a second straight draw in the Bundesliga...
83',action,OFF THE POST! Lewandowski is a coat of paint away from breaking Ingolstadt hearts! The Pole lets fly from 25 yards with a fierce effort that crashes against the woodwork with Hansen well beaten.
82',action,"For a couple of minutes, Ingolstadt hold the upper hand and go close to snatching the breakthrough, as a deep ball into the box from Hadergjonaj has to be cleared in the nick of time."
80',substitution,"; Meanwhile, Bayern's final alteration sees Lahm given a breather as Rafinha takes his place."
79',substitution,; Another change for the hosts sees Groß replaced by Stefan Lex.
78',action,"WHAT A WASTE! Ingolstadt are awarded a free-kick in a decent position. However, the hosts waste the opportunity by overhitting the delivery and subsequent cross back into the box. That will not have impressed their manager too much."
76',yellow-card,Yellow Card Pascal Groß ; Groß is the next player to have his name taken by the referee.
74',substitution,; Ingolstadt also make their first change and Lezcano is replaced by Lukas Hinterseer.
74',substitution,; That was Kimmich's last action of the game as he goes off to be replaced by Arjen Robben.
73',yellow-card,Yellow Card Robert Lewandowski ; Lewandowski is also booked for his reaction to the challenge.
73',yellow-card,Yellow Card Romain Brégerie ; Brégerie is booked for a rash challenge on Kimmich.
71',action,"Bayern turn up the pressure and Vidal is almost played in behind by Muller's precise through ball. However, there is just too much power for the stretching Chilean to get it under control."
70',action,"OFFSIDE?! Costa looks to make an impact and times his run to perfection to latch onto a lofted through ball. However, the linesman has his flag raised for offside. Strange decision that one!"
68',action,"NO PENALTY! Bayern appeal as Lewandowski goes down under pressure in the box. However, the referee tells the Polish striker to get to his feet rather than point to the spot."
67',action,"Ancelotti has made it clear that his intention is to win this game with that substitution. It also shows that he is thinking about Wednesday, when Bayern resume their UEFA Champions League campaign against Arsenal in the opening leg of the Last 16."
65',substitution,"; Bayern make their first change with 25 minutes remaining, as Douglas Costa replaces Alonso."
62',action,"This time 13 years ago, FC Ingolstadt had been formed for six days. Who would have thought that, just over a decade on, they would be holding their own against Bayern Munich at the Audi Sportpark?"
60',action,"As we hit the hour-mark, it has been a very spirited performance so far by Ingolstadt. Walpurgis will be urging his players to maintain their current performance levels in order to claim a precious point."
57',action,"Bayern are still searching for the breakthrough but, elsewhere, second-placed Leipzig are currently 2-0 down against Hamburg. That means that the Bavarians can open up a seven-point lead at the top with a victory here."
55',action,"At the other end, Hansen shows shades of opposite number Neuer, as he races out of goal to clear the danger following a quickfire Bayern counter."
54',action,"CHANCE! The hosts force a corner and almost make the most of it! Bregerie meets the delivery with his head, but Leckie cannot control his attempt to steer the ball towards goal and it goes way over the bar."
52',action,"The visitors continue to look purposeful in possession whenever they go forward, but Ingolstadt are fighting the tide at the moment."
49',action,That was very nearly the best possible start to the second half from Bayern. The words of Ancelotti at the break appear to still be ringing loudly in their ears.
47',action,"OFF THE LINE! Bayern go straight onto the attack and Muller's shot is trickling towards the line, but Hadergjonaj is in the right place at the right time to clear."
46',action,KICK-OFF! The referee blows his whistle and Bayern get the ball rolling once more.
,action,The teams are making their way back out onto the pitch and the second half is imminent.
,action,"A frustrating first half for Bayern, who have been held for the opening 45 minutes by the relegation battlers. The league leaders will be looking to come out firing after the break, though."
,action,HALF-TIME: INGOLSTADT 0-0 BAYERN MUNICH
45'+1',action,The referee blows for half-time!
45',action,The fourth official raises his board to indicate that there will be a minimum of one minute added on at the end of this first half.
43',action,"Bayern are slowly turning up the pressure as the first half draws to a close. However, their momentum is halted when Alonso sends an ambitious effort from distance well wide of the target."
41',action,"There is a sense of frustration beginning to creep in amongst the Bayern players. The league leaders are anxious that they should be winning this game, but just need to be patient at the moment."
39',action,"CHANCE! The free-kick is headed over and Bayern go straight onto the counter attack. The ball finds Thiago in the box, but the Spaniard's shot on goal is a tame one and easy for Hansen to gather."
38',action,"At the other end, the retiring skipper concedes a free-kick around 35 yards from goal after a careless challenge. This is a good opportunity for the hosts..."
36',action,"Lahm looks to inspire his teammates as he gets forward from right-back and into the Ingolstadt area. He lays the ball off for Thiago, whose side-footed effort bends well wide of the target. At least that was more purposeful by the visitors!"
34',action,"Along with RB Leipzig, Ingolstadt are the only team yet to take a point off Bayern in the Bundesliga but, if they can continue to be stubborn, that unwanted label could disappear today. Of course, there is still a long way to go..."
32',action,"It is fair to say that there has not been too much urgency to Bayern's play so far in this first half. On paper, they certainly have the quality to overcome Ingolstadt but, as last week proved, Ancelotti's men cannot afford to take too much for granted against their fellow Bavarians."
30',action,"Rememeber, despite holding a four-point cushion at the summit of the Bundesliga, Bayern are looking to get back to winning ways in the German top-flight today following a 1-1 draw with Schalke last weekend that ended a seven-match winning run."
27',action,"There is a slight concern for Bayern after Lewandowski goes to ground and stays down. However, the talisman is soon back on his feet and raring to carry on. Chances have not fallen too freely for him so far but, as has so often been the case in the past, he only needs one chance."
25',action,"Thiago stands over the dead ball on this occasion but, once again, nothing comes of it for the league leaders. Ingolstadt have held firm so far."
23',action,"Bayern are awarded another free-kick but, this time, near the corner flag as Lewandowski is held up by the covering defender. This is a good opportunity for the visitors..."
21',action,"Lewandowski and Hansen were both hurt after colliding in their race for the ball. However, after attention from the physios, the two men are soon back on their feet and perfectly fine to continue."
20',action,"GREAT CLEARANCE! A clever ball sees Lewandowski spring the offside trap and loop it over the advancing Hansen. However, Matip makes up vital ground to clear off the line and deny the Pole his 16th Bundesliga goal of the season."
18',action,"They may be on the back foot in terms of possession, but Ingolstadt are generally holding their own with Bayern at the moment. The hosts are still seeing the ball, but need to make the most of it when possible."
16',action,"At the other end, Bayern are awarded a free-kick around 35 yards from goal. Xabi Alonso stands over the ball, but his usually trademark delivery is not so on this occasion and easily dealt with by the hosts."
14',action,"Lezcano looks to get involved for the first time as he tries to take on Hummels. However, the Germany international stands firm and makes a solid block tackle to stop the forward in his tracks."
12',action,"That incident appears to have stemmed the flow of proceedings at the Audi Sportpark. Both sides have gone very scrappy in possession, which is frequently changing hands as a result."
10',action,"As touched upon earlier, Lewandowski has scored in each of the four previous meetings between the sides - netting four of Bayern's seven goals. However, he was close to an early bath there rather than continuing his hot streak of form against Die Schanzer."
8',action,"LUCKY LEWANDOWSKI! Bayern's top scorer leaves his foot in a challenge on Morales, who he appears to stamp on. The Ingolstadt man is understandably angry but, fortunately for Lewandowski, the referee did not see the incident and both players get a stern talking to."
7',action,"Bayern force the game's first corner, which is met well by the head of Hummels. However, the centre-half is unable to direct his effort towards the target."
5',action,"Already, Ingolstadt are looking anxious whenever they have possession of the ball. Everything seems too rushed by the hosts at the moment."
3',action,"This is an important game at both ends of the Bundesliga table today. As expected, Bayern have quickly settled into their rhythm and are controlling the tempo."
1',action,KICK-OFF! The referee blows his whistle and Ingolstadt get the match underway!
,action,HERE THEY COME! The players are making their way out onto the field and kick-off is just moments away...

,action,"Meanwhile, Ingolstadt have made three changes from the side that were beaten by Hertha BSC last Saturday. Maik Walpurgis welcomes back Matthew Leckie from injury along with Almog Cohen, while Marcel Tisserand returns in defence after starting on the bench following his return from the Africa Cup of Nations last weekend. Florent Hadergjonaj has shaken off a knock to retain his place at right-back, as Anthony Jung and Roger drop to the bench."

,action,"BAYERN MUNICH (4-2-3-1): Neuer; Lahm, Martinez, Hummels, Alaba; Vidal, Alonso; Muller, Kimmich, Thiago; Lewandowski."
,action,"Carlo Ancelotti saw Bayern bounce back from their 1-1 draw with Schalke last weekend with a 1-0 victory over Wolfsburg in the DFB-Pokal on Tuesday. He makes just two changes from the cup clash with Thomas Muller returning to the starting line-up along with Joshua Kimmich, while Thiago Alcantara keeps his place as Arjen Robben and Douglas Costa drop to the bench. Philipp Lahm retains his place at right-back in the week where he announced his retirement from football at the end of the season. Up front, Robert Lewandowski is aiming to score against Ingolstadt for the fifth game running."
,action,"Bayern Munich are looking to build on their four-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga and will fancy their chances, having won each of the four previous meetings with Ingolstadt, who are desperate to move out of the relegation zone by claiming a scalp here."
