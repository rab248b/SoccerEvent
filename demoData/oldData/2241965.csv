,action,"And that will do it from the Liberty Stadium as Paul Clement's first match in charge of Swansea ends in a comprehensive defeat to Arsenal. Two own goals either side of strikes from Giroud and Sanchez did the damage. The Gunners move back into the top four provisionally, while relegation still stares the Swans in the face. That's it from me, thanks for joining."
90'+2',action,Koscielny comes off second best in an aerial challenge with McBurnie and needs some attention from the physios. That may well bring us to the end of this match as the defender jogs off.
90',action,"Into the dying moments of this game and the result has not been in doubt for some time. It's almost been a perfect trip to Wales for Arsenal, but they will wait anxiously on news of Giroud's injury."
88',action,"Arsenal's attack in the last few minutes has turned into a Xhaka shooting gallery. As the defence has collapsed around their attackers, the Swiss midfielder is often the spare man at the top of the box, but his latest effort is swallowed by Fabianski."
86',action,"There was a chance for Swansea to overload Arsenal there with Borja on the ball, but they fail to cash in on their momentum and the defence can get back to restrict Sigurdsson to a low shot into the arms of Cech."
84',action,"Poor from Swansea again. McBurnie makes the first mistake by not playing the ball inside the full-back for Borja to attack. Then, the Spaniard tries to follow that up with a poor run down the right, where he's caught offside."
82',action,"Arsenal have a chance to make it 5-0 as Xhaka puts some power behind a drive, but Fabianski is equal to it with a smart hold. The Polish keeper has done well all things considered."
82',action,"Sanchez is making a point of showing his displeasure at being substituted. It's all a bit petulant from the Chilean, and will do nothing to smooth over his well-publicised contract negotiations."
80',action,"Swansea attempt to get some consolation on the scoreboard, as McBurnie makes a good run down the left, but his low cross is missed by both Borja and Fer. That sums up the hosts in this game."
79',substitution,; Danny Welbeck also gets a run out as Sanchez departs.
79',substitution,; Lucas Perez appears in place of Ozil.
78',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Leroy Fer ; Ramsey is caught late by Fer, who is shown a yellow card."
77',action,"How about Alexis Sanchez though? That's 14 goals in the Premier League for him this season - no one else has scored more. He didn't sulk at playing wide this evening, and got his reward."
75',action,Swansea continue to ship goals by the barrel. That's one shy of a half-century of goals they've conceded in their 21 games so far. It's surely the first thing that Clement has to address if they're to survive.
73',goal,"Goal Alexis Alejandro Sánchez Sánchez ; Sanchez makes it four! Iwobi's clever ball to Oxlade-Chamberlain sees the winger cut it back to Ramsey, and while Routledge makes a good challenge, the Chilean is there to pick up the pieces inside the area!"
71',substitution,; Cork's game is at an end as Oliver McBurnie replaces him.
70',action,How do you account for situations like that? Two own goals in the second half have surely put this match beyond Swansea's reach. It's quite the macabre start to Clement's tenure.
70',substitution,; More changes for Swansea as Borja is on for Llorente.
67',own-goal,"Own Goal Kyle Naughton ; AND THAT'S THREE! Another own goal against Swansea, and this time it's Naughton as the unlucky character. Ozil's ball to Iwobi sees the youngster size up his marker before flinging the ball into the six-yard area, where the defender turns it into his own net."
66',action,"Some signs that Swansea's interest in this game is not quite put to bed as they create two solid chances in the past few minutes. However, moments later, they're nearly undone on the counter."
64',action,"Swansea create another shooting opportunity as the ball drops kindly for Fernandez inside the area as Arsenal fail to clear, but he leans back and slides the ball well over the target."
62',action,"Swansea break forward for probably the first time in the second half, as Routledge takes down a bouncing ball and unleashes a decent strike that draws a comfortable low save out of Cech."
60',substitution,; Belated withdrawal for Giroud as Oxlade-Chamberlain comes on.
59',action,"Arsenal sense the chance for more here as Granit Xhaka's low pass into Giroud is nearly flicked into the path of Sanchez, but a shoddy first touch ends the momentum of that attack."
57',action,"Big sigh of relief from the Arsenal bench as they open up a cushion against Swansea. They've been far from their peak, and both goals have been scrappy at best, but they have the inside line on three points now."
55',substitution,; Nathan Dyer has been withdrawn for Leroy Fer.
54',own-goal,"Own Goal Jack Cork ; ARSENAL DOUBLE THEIR LEAD! Poor Fabianski, there was nothing that he could do about that. The Gunners made their own luck though, forcing the issue in the box and Iwobi's low ball is looped over the keeper by Jack Cork's deflection."
52',action,"Some more pressure engineered by Sanchez sees the ball pinned in the Swansea area, before the Chilean squeezes in a pass to Ramsey, whose close-range shot is saved by Fabianski!"
50',action,"Swansea are searching for a way back into the game, but they just have to be careful that they don't leave too much space in behind for Arsenal to break, as Sanchez has just very nearly done a couple of times."
48',action,"No change for Arsenal at the break, as Giroud has appeared for the second half. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has been warming up since the first period, and continues to do so on the sidelines."
46',action,Off we go again!
,action,"And that's half time at the Liberty Stadium with Swansea and Arsenal separated by a Giroud goal from close range. It's not been a classic by any stretch, but Clement will be satisfied with the energy of his side in midfield to force the Gunners into a few turnovers. A lot to play for still. Stay tuned."
45',action,"SLICED OVER! There's still plenty of life in Swansea, as yet another loose pass from Arsenal presents Nathan Dyer with the ball on the right, but the wide man shows no composure and lashes it over the bar."
43',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Sung-Yeung Ki ; DRAMA! Big call from the referee as Ki goes down in the area when trying to attack a flick from Llorente. Replays show that there was a bit of contact from Koscielny, but the Korean did go down easily, and he's booked for diving. Close call!"
43',action,From joy to worry in a matter of minutes. Giroud and Arsenal have been flip-flopping on bringing him off or waiting until half-time to assess the damage of his injury. It's worth noting that he didn't even celebrate his goal - instead signaling for a substitution.
41',action,"How about Giroud - that's five goals in as many games for him now, and every one of those has been crucial. He always seems to respond best when his place as a striker is under threat. He's not moving well here though as he appeared to pick up a knock after that goal."
39',action,"A real test of character for Swansea now. They were enjoying a strong spell of possession before conceding that goal, and it will be interesting to see how they respond to adversity."
37',goal,"Goal Olivier Giroud ; GIROUD OPENS THE SCORING! The Frenchman misses a tap-in after a scything Gunners counter, but Sanchez picks up the pieces, crossing for Ozil whose header was blocked, but the striker stroked home the rebound!"
36',action,"Arsenal try to launch that little move that they like so much, when an attacking midfielder, in this case Ozil, plays a one-two with Giroud at the top of the box. However, the Frenchman's return pass to the German is cut out."
34',action,"Nothing between the sides so far with a little over 10 minutes to go until half time. You get the sense that Arsenal are getting more comfortable on the ball though, with Swansea forced to do a bit of defending."
32',action,"Terrible. Arsenal launch what looked like a swift and troubling counter, with Ramsey charging and exchanging passes with Ozil down the left. However, he tries to hook the ball over the top for Giroud, who didn't even attempt to touch the ball as he was returning from an offside position."
30',action,"STINGER! Arsenal are on the attack for the first time in a long while, as Alex Iwobi lays the ball off to the corner for Sanchez, who cuts inside onto his right boot and warms the palms of Fabianski at the near post."
28',action,"Nearly three seasons on and Arsenal still haven't quite figured out how to get the best out of Sanchez and Giroud at the same time. The Chilean has looked better through the centre this season, but the Frenchman's recent form means that he can't be left out."
26',action,"Mustafi has been poor from open play, and he gives the ball away to Sigurdsson, but the home side can't quite profit as the ball from the former Tottenham man hands possession right back to Arsenal."
24',action,"It seems like Mustafi and Koscielny are taking it in turns to challenge Llorente whenever the ball is in the air. Swansea are winning a lot of 50-50's, but are struggling to hold the ball in the final third."
22',action,"The game has entered a bit of a stagnant period, with both sides trading spells in possession but accomplishing little on the ball. The two target men, Giroud and Llorente, aren't involved in the game much."
19',action,"Right on cue, a rainbow stretches over the Swansea end of the Liberty Stadium. Is that a metaphor for a new dawn under Clement after the doom and gloom that has been their 2016-17 so far?"
17',action,"Like they did against Crystal Palace and Bournemouth, the Arsenal defence are rocking, as Laurent Koscielny's back-header sells Mustafi short, forcing him to concede a corner under pressure."
15',action,"OVER THE BAR! First Gabriel then Shkodran Mustafi fail to keep the ball out on the right, and the home side can pounce, with Sigurdsson played in at the top of the box, lashing a shot well over the top."
13',action,"Clement is not alone in the Swansea dugout of course. Joining him is Claude Makelele, who has returned to the Premier League as the assistant manager of the Welsh club."
11',action,"FIRST SAVE OF THE GAME! Kyle Naughton gets the ball at the corner of the box and he eschews a cross to Llorente to lash a shot across the body of Petr Cech, who stretches to make a fine stop."
9',action,"Swansea are knocking it around with some confidence here, and they've already picked off a couple of slack Arsenal passes in midfield. That's where the wide men need to stretch the visitors as Llorente isn't likely to break beyond the defence."
7',action,"The referee lets a rough challenge in midfield ride, and Aaron Ramsey can come away with the ball, but a pass out wide to Sanchez goes out of play. A little sloppy from Arsenal to start."
5',action,"Ozil, back in the Gunners team today, scampers down the left channel and cuts a head-height ball back for Sanchez to attack, but Federico Fernandez manages to get there first to make an important clearance."
3',action,"Good start this by Swansea, although a few attempts to play the ball into the feet of Llorente sees the big striker crowded out. As good as he is with his back to goal, the hosts will also want him making runs into the box to get on the end of crosses."
1',action,Off we go!
,action,"Mesut Ozil has been ill for the last three games, but is back to full strength to displace Francis Coquelin in the starting XI. Olivier Giroud also heads the attack after his tie winner against Preston in the FA Cup, while Gabriel fills in at right-back."
,action,"Neil Taylor and Jay Fulton both make way in the Swansea XI, with Stephen Kingsley and Kieran Dyer taking their places. Fernando Llorente starts up top, with Gylfi Sigurdsson and Wayne Routledge also in attacking midfield."
,action,"Arsenal subs: Ospina, Lucas, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Holding, Welbeck, Reine-Adelaide, Maitland-Niles."
,action,"Arsenal (4-2-3-1): Cech; Gabriel, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Ramsey, Xhaka; Sanchez, Ozil, Iwobi; Giroud."
,action,"Swansea subs: Van der Hoorn, Fer, Borja, Nordfeldt, Angel Rangel, Fulton, McBurnie."
,action,"Swansea (4-2-3-1): Fabianski; Naughton, Fernandez, Mawson, Kingsley; Ki, Cork; Dyer, Sigurdsson, Routledge; Llorente."
,action,"After a poor December where Arsenal lost two games and dropped out of the top four, their form has picked up somewhat around the turn of the new year. They've won three of four in all competitions, although that run includes the strange 3-3 draw against Bournemouth."
,action,"Clement is Swansea's third manager this season, replacing Bob Bradley, who was sacked after only 11 games. The first of those was also against Arsenal, where they narowly fell 3-2. With the Swans second from bottom, survival is definitely the mantra."
,action,"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Premier League match between Swansea and Arsenal the Liberty Stadium. Paul Clement takes charge of his first league match at the helm of the Welsh outfit, while the Gunners are looking to get back into the top four."
