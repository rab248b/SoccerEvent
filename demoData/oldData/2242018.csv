,action,"That's all from us today folks, we hope you enjoyed the game!"
,action,"The Cherries got off to the perfect start, taking the lead through King's penalty which was won by Fraser. However sloppy defending led to the Baggies retaliating and punishing the visitors with goals from Dawson and McAuley. West Brom continue to exceed expectations, whilst Bournemouth's poor run continues in the Premier League."
,action,FULL-TIME: WEST BROM 2-1 BOURNEMOUTH
90'+6',action,That's the full-time whistle!
90'+5',action,FOSTER AGAIN! Another huge save from the Baggies keeper to stop Surman's header going into the back of the net.
90'+4',action,"GREAT SAVE! Foster who has little to do in the second half, pulls off a spectacular save to deny Mousset, his powerful shot looked like it was heading into the back of the net."
90'+2',action,"McClean and Rondon are starting to link up very well in the dying minutes. Rondon this time turns provider for his teammate who fires a shot at goal, but it is straight at Boruc who makes a good save to deny him."
90',action,There will be a minimum of five minutes played here.
89',action,"CHANCE! West Brom go close to wrapping up all three points with a third goal! McClean fires a low ball across the face of goal and Rondon, who is charging in goes agonisingly close to getting on the end of it."
88',substitution,; Third and final Baggies substitution with Nacer Chadli coming off to be replaced by Sam Field.
86',action,"Very little time left to play here at the Hawthorns and the Baggies are still defending well and keeping Bournemouth out. However the visitors have failed to really test Foster all game, he has barely had a save to make since the opening few minutes of the game."
84',action,"Anything that Bournemouth can take from this game would be a positive as they have a tough run of games coming up, their next game is away at Manchester United. Meanwhile the Baggies will travel to Crystal Palace."
81',action,"Good defending from the front by West Brom, all of the players are doing their bit to limit the amount of possession the Cherries have in their half. A trait you see from any Tony Pulis side. Still no more chances to score."
79',substitution,; Third and final Bournemouth substitution as the Cherries go in search of an equaliser. Marc Pugh is the man coming off and he is replaced by Lys Mousset.
76',action,"If Bournemouth can try and get Fraser on the ball more he could really cause West Brom problems. He has been terrific throughout today, from winning the penalty in the opening minutes and he has been a constant nuisance for the Baggies defence."
73',substitution,; Another West Brom substitution with James Morrison coming off and on comes Claudio Ariel Yacob in his place.
72',action,Less than 20 minutes to play here and Bournemouth are struggling to create any chances to score. Good defending by the Baggies so far and they aren't allowing the visitors any time or space in their danger zone.
69',yellow-card,Yellow Card James McClean ; McClean receives a yellow card for his late challenge on Fraser which led to a decent free-kick opportunity for the Cherries.
69',action,Bournemouth have a free-kick in an excellent position! Fraser goes on a terrific run and is apruptly brought down by McClean on the very edge of the box. Now the visitors have a great chance to score. The ball is laid off to Cook... He smashes it straight at the wall!
68',action,Boruc does well to gather the ball from a corner under heavy pressure from Baggies players. Doing a much better job than he did for the West Brom second goal.
66',substitution,"; Jack Wilshere was a doubt ahead of the game and his game is now over, he comes off to be replaced by Dan Gosling."
66',substitution,"; Here is the first of a double Bournemouth substitution, Harry Arter is the man coming off to be replaced by striker, Benik Afobe."
63',action,"Harry Artur shoots from 25 yards out, but his low shot goes narrowly wide of the post. Good build-up play by Bournemouth to set up that chance, but it didn't really threaten Ben Foster."
61',action,"Brilliant run from Chadli down the left, he cuts inside and beats Smith he then has the opportunity to take a shot at goal but he delays his shot in favour of trying to dance into the box. However Mings was on his toes and made an excellent challenge to stop him in his tracks."
58',action,The pace of the game has certainly picked up a notch in the past few minutes. Bournemouth are trying hard to keep possession and create goal scoring opportunities to equalise. Whilst the Baggies will want to grab another goal which will surely secure all three points.
56',action,"Excellent pressure from the Baggies sees them win the ball back deep in the visitors half. However Bournemouth win a throw-in and eventually regain possession and mount an attack. Pugh and Wilshere go close to meeting Fraser's cross at the far post, but it is too high for the midfield men."
54',substitution,"; Here comes the substitution, Craig Dawson is already back in the changing rooms and he is replaced by James McClean."
53',action,"Play has now resumed here, but it looks like Dawson's game is over after his head injury. The Baggies have reshuffled their pack to cope with his absence whilst they get a substitute ready."
51',action,"Stoppage in play at the moment as Mings and Dawson receive medical treatment for a clash of heads, it looks like Dawson has come worse off and he may be heading off the pitch."
50',action,OFF THE CROSSBAR! Craig Dawson sees his header smash against the bar after a great ball in from a corner. The ball then ends up in the back of the net with Chadli appearing to get the final touch but it is ruled out for OFFSIDE! Huge appeals from the Baggies players and supporters. The goal is ruled out.
49',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Allan Romeo Nyom ; Nyom is the first player to receive a yellow card, for his late challenge on Fraser."
49',action,"Both sides are struggling to retain possession of the ball at the moment, the game is back and forth between the two teams. The Baggies will be far happier for the game to stay like this than their opponents."
48',action,West Brom's loss in this fixture last season was their only previous home defeat in six league games against the Cherries (W3 D2).
46',action,The second half is underway!
,action,"Bournemouth took the lead after just five minutes after Nyom gave away a penalty, which Josh King converted. However their lead didn't last long as Craig Dawson scored the equaliser on 10 minutes, before Gareth McAuley capitalised from Artur Boruc's mistake to pounce and give the Baggies the lead."
,action,HALF-TIME: WEST BROM 2-1 BOURNEMOUTH
45'+2',action,That's the half-time whistle!
45'+1',action,"West Brom have a corner in injury time of the first-half. Nyom took on Cook down the left and won a corner, Evans meets the ball in but his header is straight at Boruc."
45',action,There will be a minimum of two minute added time played here.
42',action,Good spell here for Bournemouth just minutes before the half-time whistle. Can they score an equalising goal before the break?
40',action,"Marc Pugh with the shot at goal! Jack Wilshere turns well in the middle of the park and plays a defence spiltting ball through to Pugh who fired a shot at goal from a tight angle, but he couldn't quite wrap his foot around it and it hits the side netting. Good chance."
38',action,"Cook tries his luck from long range, but it goes well over the bar. The space opened up for the Cherries defender to take a shot, but it didn't come close to troubling Foster."
37',action,"The ball falls very nicely to Josh King in the Baggies penalty area, he chests the ball down and is about to swivel and take a shot at goal, when Jonny Evans just nips the ball off his toes. Excellent defending from the returning defender."
35',action,"PENALTY SHOUT! The Baggies want a penalty now! Rondon tries to take on Mings in the box, lifting the ball over the centre-back but the centre-back uses his pace to get back and make a superb last-ditch challenge, winning the ball and clearing the danger. However the West Brom striker is adamant that he should have been awarded a penalty. Nothing given."
34',action,A lot better from Bournemouth as they start to get more crosses into the box and try to create chances. However the Baggies have a strong back line and are able to deal with any aerial challenges.
33',action,Ironic cheers here from the West Brom supporters as Bournemouth try to mount an attack through Fraser. He trys to pick out a team-mate but fires his pass straight at Mark Clattenburg and the ball falls straight to a West Brom shirt.
31',action,"West Brom have started to sit back more now, allowing Bournemouth to keep the ball but they are limiting them to possession in their own half and the middle of the pitch which is very easy to deal with."
29',action,The bottom of the Premier League is very tight at the moment and Bournemouth despite sitting 14th in the table are not out of trouble yet. They are in a poor run of form and could easily be dragged into a relegation battle.
27',action,"Only Leicester have collected fewer Premier League points in 2017 than the Cherries, they have also conceded the most goals this calendar year with 20."
25',action,"That goal was a bitter blow to Bournemouth who have played well but they have been undone by a poor mistake from their goalkeeper. Now West Brom are storming forward at every opportunity, trying to extend their lead."
21',goal,Goal Gareth McAuley ; GOOOAAALLL! SHOCKER FROM BORUC! West Brom take the lead from the resulting corner that came from Morrison's blocked shot. The ball came in and plenty of Baggies and Cherries players went up for it and Boruc went up to try and punch the ball clear but he completly misses it and it fell straight to Gareth McAuley who got the final vital touch!
21',action,"CHANCE WEST BROM! Good football from the Baggies. First Rondon has his first attempt at goal, which is well blocked by Cook. The ball then falls to James Morrison who fires a shot at goal which is again blocked superbly and goes out for a corner."
19',action,"Salomon Rondon has struggled to make an impact on the game so far, the Baggies striker has barely touched the ball in the opening 20 minutes of the game, with the Bournemouth centre-back pairing of Mings and Cook marshaling him well."
17',action,"Neither are really creating any goal scoring opportunities here at the moment, with both teams struggling to keep the ball in their possession for a long spell."
15',action,"STAT: Before the Cherries early goal here today. All four of Bournemouth's previous Premier League goals against West Brom had come in the second half, with the last player to score a first-half goal for Bournemouth against West Brom in any competition was Eddie Howe - in a 1-0 FA Cup win in January 1999."
13',action,"Much better from West Brom now, they are really starting to threaten the Bournemouth goal. Chadli and Fletcher starting to pull the strings for the Baggies going forward. The latter of whom wins a corner for his team, which is well cleared by Bournemouth."
10',goal,"Goal Craig Dawson ; GOAL WEST BROM! The Baggies haev equalised just five minutes later! Craig Dawson let fly from the edge of the box and it took a delfection off Charlie Daniels, which beat Artur Boruc in the Cherries net. Excellent finish by the right-back, which has seen the hosts equalise."
10',assist,"Assist Nacer Chadli ; Nacer Chadli drove at the Cherries defence, but his options were limited as he got closer to the box, so he cut back inside and laid the ball off to Dawson on the edge of the penalty area who fired home."
9',action,"CLOSE! Adam Smith forces Ben Foster into making a fingertip save to tip the ball over the crossbar and deny him from long-range. The Cherries right-back cut inside and was allowed far too much time and space on the edge of the box, his shot was well struck. Corner comes to nothing."
7',action,"The Baggies need to regather their composure here as they looked shocked at conceding the early goal. Bournemouth's players look full of confidence, playing the ball around with ease, which makes a change to how many of their recent games have gone."
5',penalty-goal,"Penalty Goal Joshua King ; KING CONVERTS! Josh King makes no mistake from the penalty spot to give the visitors an early lead. That was exactly what they needed, perfect start."
4',action,"PENALTY BOURNEMOUTH! With the Cherries first attack of the game they have a huge chance to take the lead! The referee had not hesitations in awarding a penalty. Ryan Fraser drove at Allan Nyom, trying to get round the Baggies defender and the young Cherries player has the pace to beat him and Nyom pulls him down."
3',action,"Good early start from the Baggies, they have kept the ball well and look keen to bag themselves an early goal here today. There is an excellent atmosphere here inside the Hawthorns, with the home supporters in fine voice."
