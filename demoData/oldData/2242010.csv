,action,"FULL-TIME: A huge cheer from the home support as their side secure a massive, and deserved, 1-0 win at Selhurt Park. Patrick van Aanholt scored the only goal as Palace dominated the first half before Middlesbrough got into the game after the break. Very few clear cut chances for Karanka's side, in truth Palace could have had more than their solitary goal."
90'+4',action,Middlesbrough work hard to try and unlock the stubborn home defence but Gestede's weak effort is brought in by Hennessey and he drains as much of the clock as he possibly can.
90'+2',action,"CHANCE FOR PALACE TO BURY THE GAME. Townsend streaks forward down the right, gets into the box and sends a rocket of an effort just wide. Benteke is screaming and the England wideman, he wanted to ball played in for a tap-in."
90',action,"There will be FIVE added minutes. Groans from the home supporters, they know their work isn't done quite yet."
89',action,Middlesbrough just pumping the ball into the Palace penalty area. And as quickly as they send it in Palace send it back out. Big Sam is screaming at his side to get behind the ball.
88',substitution,"; Substitution: Wilfried Zaha's job is done for the afternoon as Allardyce looks to cling onto their slender lead, bringing on defender Scott Dann."
87',substitution,"; Substitution: Patrick van Aanholt, who picked up a knock moments ago, is replaced by Jeffrey Schlupp."
86',action,Still Boro push forward in search of a goal that will bring them level. Fabio sprints into the Palace box and lashes a left-foot effort high and wide. Time running out for Middlesbrough now.
85',action,"Van Aanholt is down an eceiving treatment, perhaps trying a bit of time wasting tactics. The away fans are not happy with his sluggish departure to the sidelines."
83',yellow-card,Yellow Card Joel Ward ; Yellow card:  Joel Ward finds his way into referee Madley's book for a trip on Ramirez.
81',action,"ANOTHER PENALTY SHOUT! Robert Madley is in no mood to be handing out spot-kicks today. Zaha again the subject of a possible foul but his, and the Palace faithful's, remonstrations are waved away."
79',substitution,; Substitution: Final roll of the dice for Karanka as his side goes in search of an equaliser. Cristhian Stuani departs and the ever lively Adama Traoré comes on in his place.

76',yellow-card,Yellow Card James McArthur ; BOOKING: This time James McArthur goes into the book for a foul on Downing.
75',yellow-card,Yellow Card Fábio Pereira da Silva ; BOOKING: Fábio da Silva is shown a yellow for upending Zaha as he attempted to wriggle away from the Brazilian full-back.
74',action,"As quickly as the visitors attack, Palace go up the other end and have a half chance themselves. Puncheon reacts first to a blocked free-kick and tries his luck from outside the box. His effort is quickly closed down however and goes out for a throw-in."
72',action,Lovely build up play from Middlesbrough. Ayala bursts forward and plays a slick one-two with Guedioura before striking a left footed shot straight at Hennessey.
68',action,The game is opening up now. Palace fly down the other end with Townsend who plays in Benteke on the edge of the Boro area. His shot is blocked by multiple defenders and cleared to safety.
66',action,"PENALTY SHOUT FOR MIDDLESBROUGH! Stuani's shot is blocked by Puncheon, the Uruguayan  seems to think Puncheon used his arm to block the effort. A corner is given which comes to nothing."
65',action,A speculative shot from Gibson from 25-yards. His effort is well struck but it is right into the arms of Hennessey.
63',substitution,; Substitution: Allardyce looks to his bench for the first time this afternoon. Yohan Cabaye is withdrawn and James McArthur enters. Palace looking to be more solid in the middle of the park after Boro have caused them problems in the second half.
63',action,"Another brilliant run from Zaha, he has run the show for Palace today. He dribbles past three Middlesbrough players before slipping in McArthur. He can't get his shot away as Gibson makes a well timed intervention and shepherdsthe ball back to Valdes."
61',substitution,; Substitution: The second change of the afternoon for Boro with  Adam Forshaw jogging off to be replaced by Adlène Guédioura.
60',action,"Wonderful run from Zaha, the build up play deserved a goal. Zaha shows great strength to hold off Fabio before skipping past Ayala. He plays to ball to Benteke who attempts to find him with the one-two but his pass is overhit."
57',action,BIG CHANCE FOR THE VISITORS. Hennessey beats away Stuani's well struck half volley from eight yards out. The visitor's best chance of the match so far. Karanka must be please with how his side has bounced back in the second half.
56',action,JUST OVER from Zaha. Puncheon wins possession in the Boro half and feeds Zaha who runs at the Middlesbrough back three before unleashing a swerving effort which is just over the bar.
54',action,Boro raid forward once more with de Roon picking out Gestede on the left side of the Palace box. His shot is straight at Hennessey. Palace are just trying to weather this Boro storm at the moment.

50',action,Much more attacking intent from Middlesbrough as they flurry forward again. First Stuani tries to find space in the boc then Ben Gibson raids forward trying to make something happen for the visitors. Much better from Karanka's team.
48',action,A rare attack for the away side sees Adam Forshaw take aim from 20-yards but his sails wide.
46',substitution,; Substitution: Karanka makes a change at half time with the anonymous Álvaro Negredo leaving the pitch in favour of Rudy Gestede.
45',action,CHANCE FOR PALACE. They are picking up where they left off in the first half it would seem as Puncheon flashed a dangerous ball acorss the six-yard area which requires the attention of Bernardo to clear away.
45',action,KICK-OFF: Middlesbrough get the ball rolling for the start of the second half.
,action,HALF-TIME: A very good 45 minutes for Sam Allardyce's men. They have dominated the game from the first whistle. Aitor Karanka has to change something at the break his side have posed no threat going forward. Palace take a well deserved lead 1-0 lead into the break.
45',action,Just the one minute of added time in the first half.
44',action,"Another wild effort from Puncheon. Good build up place from the home side, they work the ball from left to right before Townsend finds Puncheon on the edge of the area but his snapshot is well over the crossbar. Still Palace lead 1-0."
42',action,"A good cross from Ward from the right finds Puncheon 18-yards out, he sends his volley into row Z."
41',action,Frustration setting in for the visitors as Negredo tries his luck with a speculative half volley from all of 30-yards out. Not even close from the big Spanish forward.
40',action,Benteke is having no luck today with headers. Cabaye picks him out with a smart cross into the box but the former Liverpool man yet again heads straight over the crossbar.
37',action,CHANCE FOR PALACE to double their lead. Puncheon cuts in from the right and lets loose with a thunderbolt which Valdes parries. The ball drops to Benteke who can only head over from five yards out. Middlesbrough have been all over the place in the first half.
36',action,"James Tomkins this ime wants a penalty after he is manhandled by Ayala. That makes a hattrick of penalty shouts against Ayala in this half. The ref, again, is not interested."
34',assist,"Assist Yohan Cabaye ; Assist Yohan Cabaye, his shot rebounds off Bernardo and the loose ball finds the Dutch defender."
34',goal,"Goal Patrick van Aanholt ; GOAL!!!! PALACE TAKE A WELL DESERVED LEAD through Patrick van Aanholt. Cabaye finds himself in some space on the edge of the box and takes aim, his shot is blocked and vam Aanholt reacts quickest to pick it up and fire it into the bottom right corner from 20-yards to break the deadlock. You can't say they haven't deserved it, they have been excellent so far. Palace lead 1-0."
30',action,"A chance for Townsend as he finds space in the centre of the Boro box, but he can't tame the pass from Zaha and it is collected with ease by Victor Valdes."
30',yellow-card,Yellow Card Yohan Cabaye ; BOOKING: Cabaye is the first player in the book for a trip on Gaston Ramirez which halted a Middlesbrough counter.

26',action,It has been all Palace in the first half so far. Benteke has had two great chances to give the home side the lead but has been denied by Valdes on both ocassions. Allardyce must be very pleased with what he has seen from his side so far.

20',action,"GREAT SAVE from Valdes. Ward fizzes in a pass to Benteke who has his back to goal. He takes one touch to get it out from his body and rifles a left foot shot, on the turn, and forces Valdes into a terrific save. Still 0-0 at Selhurst Park."
19',action,Another chance for Benteke. He heads over from eight yards out after Joel Ward picks him out with a fine cross. They are creating chances at will against the visitors.

5',action,PENALTY SHOUT from Palace but referee Robert Madley waves it away. Zaha tricks his way into the box from the left and takes a tumble under pressure from Daniel Ayala. The former Manchester United winger's protests go unheard. 0-0.
