,action,"And that will wrap it up from Parc des Princes as late drama has seen the two Ligue 1 heavyweights split the points. Cavani's penalty after 81 minutes looked to have given the hosts the win, but a goal at the death from Bernardo Silva gives the visitors the draw - and first place on goal difference. That's it from us, thanks for joining!"
90'+4',action,"Huge questions should be asked of Areola on that play because even though he saw the ball late, he let it slip under him. That came seconds after he spilled a corner. Trapp's injury turned out to be game changing."
90'+2',assist,Assist Djibril Sidibé ; Sidibe will be credited with the assist for that one.
90'+2',goal,"Goal Bernardo Mota Veiga de Carvalho e Silva ; OHHH THEY'VE DONE IT! Incredible drama here as Monaco drag themselves level. Bernardo Silva wasn't closed down by his nearest opponent Cavani, and he advanced to the top of the box to fire a low shot past Areola!"
90'+2',action,"AREOLA HAD TO BE SHARP! Mbappe steps across Motta and side-foots a cultured effort that the keeper had to push away, and from the resulting corner, he nearly lets the ball spill for an attacker!"
90'+1',action,"Into stoppage time now and it appears that the jig is up for Monaco. PSG have defended with distinction throughout, and I don't think that they're going to let this slip now, although there's still some time to go..."
89',substitution,; Mbappe has been thrown on for Bakayoko.
88',action,"Monaco are trying to throw bodies forward, but their lack of cohesiveness in attack means that all that we're seeing is a few turnovers that are presenting PSG with the opportunity to counter if they want it."
87',substitution,"; Draxler's number is up, as Goncalo Guedes comes on."
86',action,"Frustration starting to seep in for Monaco, although it's Matuidi with the most reckless challenge  if the second half, stepping hard into Guedes and drawing the attention of the referee for a lecture."
84',action,"What will the response be from Monaco now? Cavani appears to have bailed PSG out again from the spot, sending them on their way to the points when a draw looked like the fairest result. The penalty was a correct call though."
83',substitution,; Lemar is taken off and on comes Carrillo.
81',penalty-goal,"Penalty Goal Edinson Roberto Cavani Gómez ; NO MISTAKE FROM CAVANI! That's goal number 27 in all competitions for the Uruguayan, as he sends Subasic the wrong way from the spot."
80',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Djibril Sidibé ; PENALTY FOR PSG! The crowd goes up in arms as Sidibe appeared to pull back Draxler, who was poised to attack a ball at the far post. The referee spotted the infraction and blew his whistle! Yellow for the defender as well."
78',action,Cavani appeals for a penalty but the referee doesn't think he was caught. The referee has been consistent in this one. There was also a really clever pass from Di Maria in the buildup to that play.
76',substitution,"; Germain has done very little all game, and in comes Moutinho to replace him."
75',action,Well those of you who took my earlier advice to find odds on a goalless stalemate are probably rubbing your hands in nervous glee right now. This one has played out with the caginess of a cup final.
73',action,"Matuidi is all on his own out left and he needs help, which arrives in the form of Kurzawa. The full-back lifts a great cross in for Draxler, who leaps well to make contact, but he can't keep his header down."
71',action,"A little more ambition shown by PSG in the last few minutes, but Draxler's reverse pass is quickly crowded out by the defence."
69',action,"ONTO THE ROOF OF THE NET! Tremendous work from Meunier to ghost past one man then skin another, and deliver a low cross for Di Maria to attack. However, the recent introduction scoops the ball over the bar."
66',action,"PSG are struggling to get the ball out of their own half as Monaco swarm all over them, looking to use their width to punish the home side, but so far, they're dealing with the crosses into the area."
64',action,"Frustrating day in front of goal from Falcao, as he tries to connect with a pedestrian cross from Bernardo Silva, but his control lets him down. He's scored 12 times in the league this season."
62',action,"As we cross the hour mark without an opener, Monaco have definitely sensed that the points are up for grabs. They've regularly peppered away at first Trapp and now Areola in the PSG goal."
60',substitution,"; Lucas has been withdrawn, and on comes Angel di Maria."
59',action,Wonderful play from Lemar to get down the line and fizz a ball into the six-yard area that was begging for a touch from a teammate. He's really looked a different player in the second half.
57',action,"Monaco will be eager to test Areola quickly after his introduction, as it's never easy for a goalkeeper to come on cold off the bench. PSG have defended well so far, and they'll need to keep it up to protect their new stopper."
54',substitution,"; After some delay where Trapp tried his best to find a measure of comfort to play on, Emery summons Alphonse Areola from the bench to replace his starting keeper."
52',action,"This is not good for PSG. Trapp, moments after two heroic saves, looks to have a problem with his hamstring, and there's serious discussion as to whether he can continue in this game."
50',action,"TRAPP NEEDED AGAIN! This time Lemar drives forward from the left, and takes aim with a stinger that needs two touches from the keeper to get it into his grasp! Enterprising play from Monaco."
48',action,"SAVE FOR TRAPP! Monaco start the second period with a bang as Bernardo Silva delivers a great ball for Falcao, who tries to steer it past the keeper but is denied! PSG manage to stand their ground."
46',action,Off we go again!
,action,"No goals between PSG and Monaco, with both sides probably feeling like the game is there for the taking in the second half. Both keepers have been worked, but there hasn't been much in the way of clear-cut chances so far. Stay tuned for the restart shortly."
45'+1',action,And that will do it for now.
44',action,"Lovely play from Matuidi to intercept a deflected Mendy cross on the edge of his own box and stride forward, out-muscling two players to advance the ball all the way to the corner flag via a link with Meunier."
42',action,"PSG nearly get caught in possession inside their own penalty area after a cross, and it takes a fortunate clearance to rob Monaco of the chance to really punish them for their carelessness."
40',action,"For the second time in this game, the flag is up just as Cavani looks to latch onto the ball inside the area. To be fair, it looked like Subasic was getting there first, and the Uruguayan implores his teammates to play the ball earlier next time."
38',action,"Thomas Meunier links with Matuidi and scampers down the right-hand side, lifting a cross to the back post that's asking a little too much of Draxler to control it and keep the momentum of the move going."
36',action,"As the half has gone on, PSG have looked the more dangerous side, although to be honest, it's not quite happening in front of goal for either team. Less than 10 minutes to go until half-time now."
33',action,"CLOSE SHAVE! Cavani's movement gets his beyond his marker again, and he nearly makes telling contact with his head on a dangerous ball that would have put Subasic in all kinds of trouble."
30',action,"PSG have a set-piece from deep, and the ball's whipped into the far post. Kurzawa out-foxes his marker Mendy to break free, but he can't stretch that extra foot to make contact with the ball."
28',action,"Sidibe and Lemar line up the set-piece which is just over 30 yards from goal. The former eventually takes charge, but Trapp, scrambling across to cover his near post, watches it bounce wide."
26',action,"The tempo of the game is slowing down a bit, and Lucas again is in the referee's doghouse as he commits a late challenge on Benjamin Mendy, which is just within shooting distance."
24',action,"PSG corral Monaco around their own penalty area, and after some play from Matuidi, Rabiot works the ball into the area for Draxler, but the January signing can't take the volley on the turn off his chest and keep it on target."
22',action,"Cavani is the first player to reach the 20-goal mark in Europe's top five leagues this season, and it's clear why as he has his third sight on goal already, but the keeper isn't too troubled."
20',action,"Trapp is called into action again as Fabinho winds up a stinger from at least 30 yards. The Brazilian's effort is heading just under the crossbar, but the keeper brushes his fingertips on it to divert it over. The corner then comes to nothing."
18',action,"Monaco have actually been the better side so far, and a corner for the visitors sees Trapp get two meaty paws on the ball to get rid of the danger, although Jardim's men manage to pick up the pieces."
15',action,"Cavani sees an attempt on goal blocked, and PSG win a corner. From the resulting delivery, the corner bounces threateningly into the six-yard area before it's hacked away at the back post."
14',action,"NOT TOO FAR WIDE! Lemar takes charge of the resulting set-piece, which is about 25 yards from goal. He curls it towards the far corner with his left, but Trapp stands still as it flies just off the mark."
12',action,"Decent back-and-forth tempo to the game developing, and I hope that the Cavani chance moments ago opens things up even more. However, the game is stopped as Lucas goes in late on Djibril Sidibe."
10',action,"FIRST CHANCE! A direct ball right down the middle nearly undoes Monaco, and Lucas made a great run to latch onto it with an even better flicked header to Cavani. However, Ligue 1's top scorer puts his laces through it and sends it into the sky."
7',action,"Similar first touch for Kevin Trapp moments later as Germain moves menacingly towards the near side to try to get his toes on a low cross ,but the German keeper positions himself well."
5',action,"PSG try to build from the back, and they manage to work the ball down the line for Lucas, who tries to tee up Edinson Cavani inside the area, but Danijel Subasic is onto the ball at his near post."
3',action,"Not a whole lot happening so far as both sides feel each other out, although with over 100 goals between them on the league this season, you'll probably find fantastic odds on a goalless stalemate."
1',action,Off we go!
,action,"It's practically a full-strength squad for Leonardo Jardim to choose from, and he goes with an expected lineup, with Valere Germain and Radamel Falcao up front. Joao Moutinho is on the bench, while Bernardo Silva and Thomas Lemar are out wide."
,action,"PSG will have to do without Marco Verratti and Javier Pastore, with the pair ruled out through injury by Unai Emery. This gives Adrien Rabiot a start in midfield alongside regulars Thiago Motta and Blaise Matuidi."
,action,"Monaco subs: Moutinho, Carrillo, De Sanctis, Raggi, Boschilia, Mbappe Lottin, Toure."
,action,"Monaco (4-4-2): Subasic; Sidibe, Glik, Jemerson, Mendy; Bernardo Silva, Fabinho, Bakayoko, Lemar; Germain, Falcao."
,action,"PSG subs: Guedes, Kimpembe, Di Maria, Areola, Maxwell, Ben Arfa, Nkunku."
,action,"PSG (4-3-3): Trapp; Meunier, Marquinhos, Silva, Kurzawa; Rabiot, Motta, Matuidi; Lucas, Cavani, Draxler."
,action,"Monaco have been ripping the nets to shreds this term, scoring 64 goals in 21 games - almost exactly three per match and 23 more than the second-highest scorers PSG. The goals have been spread nicely, with four of their players in the top 10 for scorers this campaign."
,action,"PSG have won eight straight in all competitions, conceding only one goal in that span. Along with leaders Nice, they are the only sides not to have lost a game at home this season - only letting in three goals in 10 games at Parc des Princes."
,action,"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Ligue 1 clash between PSG and Monaco. Both sides are fighting tooth and nail with Nice for the lead in the table, so tonight's game could have huge title repercussions down the line."
