,action,"They've done it! Wolves have managed to hold on to knock Liverpool out of the FA Cup, piling yet more misery on Jurgen Klopp's struggling side. It's certainly a deserved victory, as the Championship team were excellent from start to finish, with their back line remaining resolute throughout to frustrate their high-flying opponents."
,action,FULL-TIME: LIVERPOOL 1-2 WOLVERHAMPTON WANDERERS
90'+4',action,"Great play by Bodvarsson! The Iceland international holds up the ball brilliantly as he out-muscles Klavan deep down the right wing. The striker then spins round the Estonian and fires the ball off the defender and out for a corner. That is surely that for Wolves, who are just seconds away from picking up an historic win!"
90'+2',action,"Moreno twists and turns 30 yards away from the Wolves goal as he tries to beat Edwards, but he's clumsily fouled by the Wolves captain and wins his side a free-kick in an excellent position. Coutinho steps and shoots, but his strike is poor and fails to beat the wall in front of him."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be four minutes of added time.
89',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Lee Evans ; Moreno charges down the left wing as he tries to kick-start another attacking move for Liverpool, but he's brought down from behind by Evans, who receives a late yellow card."
89',action,"Vital block by Lucas! Bodvarsson flies into the right-hand side of the Liverpool penalty area on a great run before spinning and shooting, but his shot fails to creep into the bottom corner of the net and is instead scooped away by Lucas at the last possible moment."
88',action,"What a save by Burgoyne! Once again, Wolves struggle to deal with a Liverpool corner as the ball dangerously pinballs around the box. It eventually falls to Sturridge, but the striker's close-range effort is pushed away by the outstretched foot of the Wolves goalkeeper."
86',goal,"Goal Divock Okoth Origi ; GOAL! Liverpool are back in the game! Wolves fail to deal with a corner and leave Origi free at the far post, where he's able to latch on to a header from Sturridge before firing the ball into the back of the net from close range."
86',assist,Assist Daniel Sturridge ; Assist Daniel Sturridge
85',action,"Gomez is the latest player to try and beat Burgoyne with a long-range strike, but the full-back's effort isn't hit cleanly enough to trouble the goalkeeper and ends up flying several yards wide of the far post."
83',action,"Origi is unable to pick out a team-mate in front of him and instead decides to test Burgoyne from 25 yards out, but, not for the first time this afternoon, the Belgian's shot is poor and trickles straight into the hands of the Wolves goalkeeper."
81',action,"Bodvarsson goes close! The corner initially fails to result in a chance on goal before a header loops over to Bodvarsson, who sticks out a foot and pokes a volley towards goal that Karius is just about able to parry away from danger."
80',action,"Impressive play by Bodvarsson! A half-hearted Liverpool attacking move comes to an end, allowing Wolves to fly forward quickly. Bodvarsson bursts into the right-hand side of the box before taking on Gomez, and he does well to force the defender into poking the ball out for a corner."
78',action,"What a chance for Wolves to make it 3-0! Gomez is caught in possession deep inside the visitors' half of the pitch, allowing Mason to fly forward on a quick counter-attack. He sprints down the left wing and then tries to set up Saville, but his pass is poor and fails to find the midfielder, who was clear through on goal."
77',substitution,; Weimann receives a rousing round of applause from the Wolves fans as he's replaced by Joe Mason.
75',action,"Liverpool's struggles in front of goal have resulted in them trying to test Burgoyne from long range. First it's Sturridge who fires a 25-yard shot straight into the hands of the goalkeeper, before a wild effort from Coutinho sails comfortably wide of the goal."
74',substitution,"; Liverpool have made their third and final substitution, with Emre Can coming on to replace Ejaria."
73',action,"Sturridge is left in a pocket of space midway inside the Wolves half of the pitch and is able to spin quickly before firing a lofted pass into the Wolves box, but it fails to find Origi in front of goal and is instead cut out by the head of Stearman."
72',action,"Woodburn goes down inside the box, but nothing is given! The youngster skips into the right-hand side of the Wolves penalty area before going down under a challenge from Evans. The hosts immediately scream for a penalty, but the referee isn't at all interested and tells the winger to get back to his feet."
71',substitution,"; Wolves have made another change, this time up front, with Dicko making way for the Iceland international Jon Dadi Bodvarsson."
70',action,"After sitting deep for so long, Wolves are eventually able to push forward on a rare foray into the Liverpool half of the pitch. Coady does well to fly down the right wing before firing a low cross into the penalty area, but there's nobody there to meet it and the home side are easily able to deal with the danger."
68',action,"Liverpool patiently move the ball around midway inside the Wolves half of the pitch before Coutinho eventually tries to pick out Woodburn with a lofted pass over to the right wing, but it's poorly hit by the Brazilian and sails out of play before it can find the youngster."
67',substitution,"; Wolves have made their first alteration of the afternoon, with 18-year-old Connor Ronan coming on to take the place of Costa."
66',action,"A lofted pass is fired down the left flank and into the path of Dicko, who does well to keep the ball in play. He then breaks down the wing before taking on Gomez, but the young defender comes out on top, despite the Wolves players believing that their striker had been fouled."
65',substitution,"; Liverpool have made their second change of the game, with Firmino making way for Daniel Sturridge."
64',action,"Vital interception by Stearman! Moreno, who has looked far more comfortable playing as a wing-back, cuts inside from the left wing before picking out Coutinho inside the penalty area, but the Brazilian is unable to fully control the ball before Stearman fires it away from danger."
63',action,"Another Liverpool attack comes to an end, and this time Wolves are able to counter quickly. Dicko, who has been largely anonymous since the half-time break, holds up the ball well before trying to pick out Costa, but his pass over to the right wing is poor and rolls harmlessly out for a goal-kick."
62',action,"Moreno goes close! Coutinho picks up the ball in the middle of the pitch and immediately fires a great pass through the Wolves defence and into the path of Moreno. The Spaniard is completely unmarked and flies into the penalty area, but he's closed down by Burgoyne and loses out to the goalkeeper, despite the young shot-stopper not manging to get a hand on the ball."
61',action,"Chance for Firmino! Liverpool keep piling bodies forward as they try to find a way through on goal, but they're unable to do so before Firmino fires a 25-yard strike straight into the hands of Burgoyne, who has had very little to deal with today."
59',action,"Great cross by Woodburn! Firmino is unable to guide a shot towards goal and has to spin and tee up Woodburn. The youngster is in a pocket of space on the edge of the penalty area and quickly whips a dangerous cross over to the far post, but it misses Origi by the narrowest of margins before bouncing over to the opposite flank."
57',action,"The home side continue putting pressure on Wolves as they desperately try to find a way back into the game, but they're unable to find a way through the sea of defenders in front of them and Origi has to watch two 20-yard shots deflect away from goal after being closed down quickly."
55',action,"Another chance for Liverpool! Once again, Firmino causes problems for the Wolves defence before firing a low cross into the middle of the box, but his pass is just about cut out by Doherty before the Brazilian eventually runs the ball out of play."
54',action,"Great opportunity for Liverpool! Woodburn bursts down the right flank on a great run before teeing up Firmino with an even better pass. The Brazilian meets the ball inside the box and quickly cuts it back to Origi, but it completely misses the Belgian before being fired away by Edwards before Moreno can get a shot away."
53',action,"Wijnaldum pushes into the Wolves half of the pitch and quickly lifts a lofted pass towards Firmino on the edge of the visitors' penalty area, but Stearman is there to chest the ball into the hands of Burgoyne."
52',action,"The cross from the set-piece is poor, however, and smashes into Woodburn on the edge of the penalty area. Liverpool quickly try to hit Wolves on a counter-attack of their own, but they're unable to do so quickly enough and have to settle for a throw-in."
51',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Georginio Wijnaldum ; Another dangerous counter-attack by Wolves! Ejaria is easily dispossessed by Saville, who then sets up Costa over on the right flank. The winger puts Wijnaldum under pressure and forces the Dutchman into dragging him back, resulting in a free-kick for Wolves in an advantageous area."
49',action,"What a chance for Firmino! Woodburn steps up and fires a cross straight on to the head of Firmino, but the Brazilian's effort on goal hits Klavan and is deflected a few yards wide of the near post."
48',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Kortney Hause ; Origi does well to skip past Hause deep down the right wing before trying to penetrate the penalty area, but the centre-back drags the Belgian to the ground and concedes a free-kick in a dangerous position before earning himself a yellow card."
46',substitution,"; Liverpool have made one substitution during the half-time break, with Randall making way for Philippe Coutinho. It looks as if the hosts are going to play with three at the back to accomodate the Brazilian."
46',action,And we're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half.
,action,"What a first half it's been for Wolves, who head into the break with a well-deserved 2-0 lead that, since they went ahead with just 53 seconds on the clock, they haven't looked like losing. A disjointed and lacklustre Liverpool team have really struggled to break down the visitors, who have sat deep and soaked up the pressure wonderfully well before hitting their opponents on the counter-attack. So far, it's worked perfectly for Paul Lambert's side."
,action,HALF-TIME: LIVERPOOL 0-2 WOLVERHAMPTON WANDERERS
45'+2',action,"Liverpool break forward on one last attack as they desperately try to find a way back into the game before the half-time break, but the hosts are far too slow in possession and are unable to trouble the visitors before the referee finally blows his whistle."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be two minutes of added time.
44',action,"Wijnaldum goes down inside the penalty area, but nothing is given! The Dutchman breaks into the right-hand side of the box and looks to shoot before going down under a tackle from Weimann, but the referee isn't at all interested and waves play on."
43',action,"Liverpool have absolutely dominated possession during the first half, but they've constantly failed to break down a very resolute Wolves defence. On several occasions they've spent far too long on the ball in advanced positions, which has made it easy for the visitors' back line."
41',assist,"Assist Hélder Wander Sousa Azevedo Costa ; Once again, Costa used his pace incredibly well to make that goal possible, but Liverpool were defensively poor and should have done better in trying to deal with the Portuguese winger. Moreno's attempted sliding tackle was a weak one, whilst both Gomez and Klavan were out of position on the edge of the box."
41',goal,"Goal Andreas Weimann ; GOAL! It's 2-0 to Wolves! A half-hearted Liverpool attacking move breaks down, allowing Wolves to fly forward on a counter-attack. Costa breaks through the middle of the pitch on a great run and brushes off Moreno before setting up Weimann with a beautiful pass into the penalty area, and the Austrian is then easily able to round Karius and poke the ball into the back of the net."
40',action,"Wolves continue to enjoy plenty of possession inside the Liverpool half of the pitch, but they don't seem to be in too much of a rush to push forward. Edwards eventually does try to swing a cross into the penalty area from deep down the right wing, but the ball bounces off his knee and out for a goal-kick after he's closed down by Moreno."
38',action,"Wolves quickly come back once again and win themselves another corner. This time it's sent short before Costa is dispossessed by Moreno, but the Spaniard is unable to take advantage on the break and ends up firing an attempted pass away from Origi and straight to an orange shirt."
36',action,"Weimann charges down the right wing as he tries to latch on to a long ball forward, but he's quickly closed down by Klavan and has to settle for a corner. It's whipped towards the near post and almost picks out David Edwards, but Moreno is just about able to make contact with the ball first."
34',action,"Saville flies into Origi and catches the Belgian with a late challenge, and Liverpool are awarded another free-kick in a dangerous position. Woodburn ssteps up and curls a looping cross into the box, but Wolves have plenty of bodies back and are easily able to deal with the danger."
32',action,"Ejaria plays an important role in yet another Liverpool attacking move as he breaks towards the Wolves penalty area. He does well to pick out Firmino, who then tries to test Harry Burgoyne, but he's slightly off balance and ends up firing his shot several yards wide of the far post."
31',action,"Liverpool keep putting pressure on Wolves, resulting in another free-kick for the home side inside the visitors' half of the pitch. It's quickly sent short before Ejaria charges his way into the penalty area, but just as he's about to shoot, the youngster is out-muscled by Stearman and loses his footing."
29',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Richard Stearman ; Georginio Wijnaldum picks up the ball in a pocket of space and quickly tries to break forward, but Stearman drags him back from behind and gives away a free-kick in a dangerous position. The set-piece initially fails to result in a chance on goal before Wijnaldum whips a dangerous cross back into the box, where it finds Lucas, but the Brazilian is unable to pick out a team-mate and loses out to Hause."
28',action,"Chance for Wolves! Firmino is clumsy in possession and loses the ball on the halfway line, allowing Wolves to break forward on another swift counter-attack. Weimann sprints into the left-hand side of the penalty area and tries to whip a cross towards Dicko, but Gomez puts the Austrian under pressure and forces him into firing his pass into the hands of Karius."
26',action,"Costa initially looks to have picked up a nasty injury to his knee, but, after receiving medical treatment for a few moments, is able to return to the pitch. A throw-in is quickly sent to the winger, who then tees up Coady, but the full-back's audacious strike from 35 yards out ends up flying well wide of the goal."
25',action,"Liverpool lose the ball on the halfway line, allowing Wolves to regain possession once again. Stearman spots a run forward from Costa and tries to pick out the winger with a lofted pass down the right flank, but, despite his best efforts, the Portuguese is unable to keep the ball in play before crashing into an advertising hoarding."
23',action,"Wolves patiently make their way into the Liverpool half of the pitch before Costa and Conor Coady link up well over on the right wing. The full-back skips past Wijnaldum and tries to whip a cross into the box, but it's closed down by Moreno and eventually results in a goal-kick for Liverpool."
21',action,"Moreno fires a low cross into the middle of the Wolves penalty area that should be easily dealt with by Hause, but it's poorly cleared by the defender and is sent straight to Lucas. The midfielder takes a quick touch before unleashing a shot from 30 yards out, but it's poorly hit and sails well wide of its intended target."
19',action,"Woodburn cuts in from the left and fires a beautiful pass over the top of the Wolves back line and into the path of Firmino. The Brazilian brings the ball down well and quickly tries to beat Doherty, but the defender comes out on top and is able to poke the ball out for a corner."
17',action,"A lofted pass from Alberto Moreno is fired over towards Randall, but Andreas Weimann rises high above the defender to head the ball out for a throw-in. It's sent short and quickly worked over to Ejaria, who is then clattered into by Lee Evans and wins Liverpool a free-kick."
15',action,"Vital interception by Stearman! Woodburn skips behind Doherty and does well to keep the ball in play before firing a low cross towards Firmino, but Stearman is there to stick a foot out to stop the ball from finding the Brazilian. That was definitely Liverpool's best chance of the afternoon so far."
14',action,"Gomez, who has spent most of the game camped inside the Wolves half of the pitch, plays a nice pass up to the edge of the visitors' penalty area that is quickly moved on to Origi, but the Belgian is unable to get the ball out of his feet and is closed down by a sea of defenders."
12',action,"Wolves are doing really well to press Liverpool in the middle of the pitch, which is frustrating the home side and making life very tough for them. So far, they've struggled to break down the visitors, who look really well organised and defensively solid."
10',action,"What a run by Costa! After dealing with the corner, the Portuguese winger bursts forward on a brilliant run through the middle of the pitch. He weaves his way through a sea of red shirts before penetrating the penalty area and shooting, but he's put off by Woodburn at the last moment and ends up firing his shot wide of the goal."
9',action,"Gomez gets himself into a good position over on the right wing before threading a through-ball towards Ovie Ejaria, but it's deflected out for a corner before it can find the midfielder. It's whipped in by Firmino and almost finds Ragnar Klavan in front of goal, but Stearman does well to get a head to the ball at the vital moment."
7',action,"Liverpool patiently work the ball around inside the Wolves half of the pitch before Divock Origi charges towards the box. The Belgian does well to skip past his marker before trying to tee up Roberto Firmino, but Stearman reads the pass brilliantly and is able to cut out the danger on the edge of the penalty area."
5',action,"Lucas Leiva loses possession in the middle of the pitch, allowing Andreas Weimann to burst forward before being clumsily fouled by Randall just outside of the penalty area. Doherty steps up and unleashes a shot from the set-piece, but it fails to beat the wall of red shirts in front of him. George Saville is able to pick up the ball, however, and then immediately whips it towards Nouha Dicko, who narrowly misses out on making contact in front of goal."
3',action,"Liverpool quickly push forward from the restart as they desperately try to get back into the game, but Ben Woodburn's pass down the right wing fails to find Connor Randall and is easily cut out by Matt Doherty deep inside the Wolves half of the pitch."
1',assist,"Assist Hélder Wander Sousa Azevedo Costa ; Costa's cross into the Liverpool penalty area was excellent, but, once again, Liverpool didn't do well enough in trying to defend a set-piece. So far this season, they've given them plenty of problems, and it's certainly something that Wolves will continue to try and target as the game wears on."
1',goal,"Goal Richard Stearman ; GOAL! What a start for Wolves! The visitors quickly win themselves a free-kick over on the left flank, which is whipped in beautifully by Helder Costa. Richard Stearman peels away from his marker and meets the ball completely unmarked in front of goal, allowing him to comfortably nod it past Loris Karius and into the back of the net."
1',action,"And we're off! Liverpool get us underway, attacking from right to left."

,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"It’s almost exactly five years since the two teams last met, with that game ending in a comfortable 3-0 victory for Liverpool. Wolves have managed to win just one of the previous eight meetings between the sides, although their last victory against the Anfield outfit (the only one they’ve enjoyed since 1984) came on this very ground."
,action,"Liverpool’s recent struggles mean that Wolves head to Anfield quietly confident about their chances of picking up what would be a spectacular victory. The Championship side were beaten 3-1 by Norwich City last weekend but easily saw off Stoke City in the last round of the FA Cup, with their Premier League opponents suffering a 2-0 defeat at the Bet365 Stadium."
,action,"Whilst it took until injury time for Southampton to score the goal that confirmed Liverpool’s exit from the EFL Cup, the Reds were far from their best during what was another lacklustre performance. The defeat, coupled with last weekend’s loss at home to Swansea City, means that they are now in danger of losing three games in a row for the first time since November 2014."
,action,"It’s been a tough month for Liverpool, who, after Wednesday's disappointing defeat in the semi-finals of the EFL Cup, have won just one game since the start of the year. That came against fourth-tier Plymouth Argyle two and a half weeks ago, meaning that today’s game, which previously would have been seen as a formality, is now being viewed as anything but."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s FA Cup fourth round clash between Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers at Anfield.
