,action,"Well, that’s all from me for now. Until next time, goodbye!"
,action,"Atleti stay in fourth, though they have moved to within just one point of Sevilla, who face European-hoepfuls Eibar later on. Sporting, meanwhile, remain planted in the bottom three."
,action,"But Griezmann and Gameiro ensured that was not to be the case as they combined to put Atleti back into the lead, before two quick-fire finishes secured a stunning hat-trick for Gameiro."
,action,"That lead lasted just three minutes though - Alvarez restoring parity. And for much of the second-half, Sporting appeared the only side likely to score a second."
,action,"Sporting were the better side before the interval, but found themselves behind a minute after the restart, Carrasco bundling home to put Atleti ahead."
,action,"FULL TIME! A cruel scoreline for Sporting, who have been dismantled in the space of five second-half minutes by Atleti substitute Kevin Gameiro."
90',action,"That being said, Simeone’s changes have been excellent, and despite been far from their best for 75 minutes, Atleti have proved their quality with a tremendous display late on."
88',action,"It has to be said, that Rubi’s decision to take Traore off seems to have cost his side. The Ivorian was causing havoc up front, and his presence alone was preventing Atleti playing the ball out from the back."
85',assist,"Assist Antoine Griezmann ; Sporting’s faithful cannot believe what has occurred. Griezmann was at the heart of that goal with another terrific pass, and Gameiro’s tremendous finish ensured a remarkable performance is marked with a hat-trick."
85',goal,"Goal Kevin Gameiro ; SENSATIONAL! That’s the hat-trick for Gameiro. Three goals in the space of five minutes for the Frenchman, who is teed up once more by Griezmann before - in a near carbon-copy of his second goal - slotting a calm finish into the bottom corner."
84',substitution,; The second change sees Burgui replaced by Victor Rodriguez.
84',substitution,"; Two changes now from Rubi, but the chase is up for Sporting, you feel. Off goes Moi Gomez, with Duje Cop coming on."
81',assist,"Assist Thomas Teye Partey ; It was good pressure from Thomas, whose introduction has helped Atleti stamp some authority on proceedings. He deflected the ball into the path of Gameiro, who made no mistake with a fine finish."
81',goal,"Goal Kevin Gameiro ; GOOOOOAAAAAALLLL!!! GAME OVER! Gameiro has his second goal in as many minutes, as the big-money signing from Sevilla proves his worth with a fantastic finish into the bottom-right corner after latching onto a loose ball."
80',assist,"Assist Antoine Griezmann ; It was a sublime bit of play from Griezmann, whose pass was perfectly-weighted."
80',goal,"Goal Kevin Gameiro ; GOOOOOOAAAAAALLLL!!! GAMEIRO RESTORES ATLETI’S LEAD! It’s heartbreak for Sporting’s back-line, as they are punctured by a deft pass from Griezmann into his compatriot, who takes an intricate first-touch to round Cuellar before sliding a finish inside the near post."
79',action,"Atleti are just starting to up the tempo now, as fitness begins to come into play. Sporting’s plays have put so much effort into this contest, but the hosts are now getting penned back as we approach the final 10 minutes."
78',action,"Was that a foul? Huge appeals from the Atleti players now as Gameiro takes a tumble under pressure from Amorebieta. The defender, who was the only player in between Atleti’s forward and Cuellar’s goal, definitely had his arm across the Frenchman, but the referee decides to let it slip."
76',substitution,"; A first substitution of the game now from Rubi. Lacina Traore receives a standing ovation as he makes way, and Carlos Castro comes on."
75',action,"NO GOAL! That’s tight! Griezmann has the ball in the back of the net after taking the ball under his spell with an excellent first touch. He appeared to have just beaten the offside trap, but the linesman gives the benefit of doubt to the hosts."
74',action,"High and wide! A brilliant run from Vrsaljko comes to nothing when the full-back decides to go for goal from a tight angle. Gameiro was waiting for the cross, but instead stands frustrated as Vrsaljko’s effort soars into the stands."
72',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Thomas Teye Partey ; Thomas has wasted no time in marking his involvement in this game, as he picks up a booking after catering into Vesga."
70',action,"Great play from Atleti. Griezmann drifts wide to the right, weaving away from his marker before sliding a clever throughball into the path of Vrsaljko, who delivers a fantastic cross to the back post. Saul, now stationed out on the left, meets it with a powerful header, but Cuellar was well-placed to make the save."
68',substitution,; A third and final change from Simeone. Thomas Partey - who will add physicality and steel to Atleti’s midfield - comes on. It is the goalscorer Yannick Carrasco who makes way.
67',action,"Patient play from the hosts, who at the culmination of a series of corners, try their luck from range. First it’s Burgui who sees a strike blocked, before Savic then intercepts Moi Gomez’s strike. The rebound falls out to Vesga, but he can only thump a first-time shot way off target."
64',action,"While Gameiro has slotted in immediately alongside Griezmann, the other alteration has forced Atleti into something of a reshuffle in midfield. Saul has joined Gabi in the centre of the park, with Koke moving out to the right, taking up the position vacated by Correa."
62',substitution,; The second change sees Angel Correa make way for Saul Niguez.
62',substitution,"; A double-change now from Simeone, who has clearly seen enough from his side. First, Kevin Gameiro replaces Fernando Torres."
60',action,"CHANCE! Wonderful play from Traore, whose strength is too much for Hernandez. He proceeds to play a neat throughball into Burgui, who in turn slips a tidy pass into the path of Moi Gomez. Alvarez is on hand to meet the looping cross, but the ball bounces wickedly off the turf and lands on the roof of the net. Somehow, it remains 1-1!"
58',action,"Cuellar races out confidently to pluck Gabi’s free-kick from the air, and wastes no time in hauling the ball into the path of Burgui. But despite having plenty of time on the ball, the Real Madrid-loanne cannot replicate the cross he created for the goal, and the chance goes amiss."
57',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Mikel Vesga Arruti ; The first booking of the game goes to Vesga, who had pulled on the shirt of Carrasco, preventing the Belgian from getting free down the left wing."
56',action,"Sporting have got the upper-hand once more now, but they must be wary of Atleti’s threat on the counter. Simeone, meanwhile, will be fuming that his side conceded so soon after going ahead."
54',action,"Close! That’s a late call from the assistant, who takes an eternity to deem that Torres was offside, despite the fact that the ex-Chelsea forward was clearly well ahead of the play. It allowed Torres the time to unleash a strike at goal, but Cuellar was equal to it."
51',action,"CHANCE! That’s a fantastic stop from Moya, who reacts instinctively to claw Alvarez’s header off the line. That was very nearly a second in quick-succession for Sporting’s No.6!"
49',assist,"Assist Jorge Franco Alviz ; Burgui scored and assisted in a single LaLiga game for the first time ever in the win over Leganes last time out, and the winger showed all of his qualities there with a wonderful run to the byline before supplying a precise cross into Alvarez."
49',goal,"Goal Sergio Álvarez Díaz ; GOOOOOAAAAAALLLLL!! AND THEY HAVE DONE JUST THAT! This amazing start to the second-half continues, as Alvarez hammers home from close-range to restore parity. Burgui did brilliantly pick out the midfielder, who made no mistake with a venomous strike that Savic could only help into the back of the net."
48',action,"Whatever Simeone said at half-time, it certainly worked! Carrasco’s effort was Atleti’s first on target, and for all their first-half positivity, Sporting have been made to pay for not finishing off their chances."
46',goal,"Goal Yannick Ferreira Carrasco ; GOOOOOOOOOAAAAAALLLLLLL!! OUTSTANDING! What a start to the second-half as, striaght from kick-off, Carrasco gets on the end of Torres’ knock-down. His effort is saved, but the Belgian continues his run and eventually bundles the ball over the line."
46',action,"Welcome back! Atleti, donning their black and yellow away strip, get proceedings back underway."
,action,"Atleti are sure to come out revitalised - probably by a stern talking-to from Simeone - after the interval, though if Sporting play like they did in the opening half, then they will have every confidence of snatching a goal."
,action,"Well, that was not that opening 45 minutes that Simeone will have been wanting from his side, who have been by far second best in this contest so far. However, despite Sporting’s efforts in the first-half, it remains goalless."
,action,HALF-TIME! Sporting Gijon 0 Atletico Madrid 0.
45',action,"Almost! For all their positivity, one mistake from Sporting very nearly allowed Atleti to take the lead right on the stroke of half-time. Correa latched onto a sloppy pass and used his pace to drive into the area, but thankfully for the hosts, Carrasco cannot get on the end of the Argentine’s cross."
43',action,"Finally, the visitors thread a move together and win a corner down the left. Koke delivers… but his cross is well dealt with by Sporting, and Douglas leads the counter."
41',action,"Simone is getting extremely animated down on the touchline, and he is evidently frustrated at how deep his side are sitting at the moment. They have been dominated by Sporting, and at the moment the visitors just seem to be waiting for half-time."
38',action,"CHANCE! Brilliant play from Moi Gomez down the left, as he gets the better of his marker and puts in a low cross. Traore’s movement is excellent, and the half-a-yard it creates allows him to meet the cross with a venomous first-time effort that rattles away off the upright. Atleti are hanging on at the moment!"
36',action,"WHAT A TACKLE! That should really have been 1-0 to Sporting! Traore bulldozed his way past Savic, but just as he was about to unleash a strike, Hernandez got across to make a superb challenge."
34',action,"Atleti just appeared to have slowed the tempo of this game down again in recent moments, and that has prevented Sporting causing as much trouble as they had been in the final third. The hosts are pressing high, though, and we have seen very little of Correa or Carrasco in the wide areas, while Torres and Griezmann have been forced back into their own half."
31',action,"Atleti have already conceded the same number of goals in LaLiga this season in 22 games than in the whole previous campaign (18). And their defence has not looked at its best so far today, though still, with half-an-hour gone, it remains goalless."
29',action,"Douglas has returned to the field of play now, so Sporting are at least back to their full complement. The hosts get lucky, though, as Torres gets on the end of Koke’s lofted pass, but is deemed to have strayed offside, though it was an incredibly close call."
27',action,"This doesn’t look great for Douglas, who has picked up what appears to be a knock to his ankle after diving in on Hernandez. After a few minutes of treatment, the Brazilian hobbles back to his feet, though it’s not yet clear if he’ll carry on."
25',action,"SAVE! Moya, at full-stretch, has to get across to parry away a header that looked set to nestle in the top-corner. Traore was waiting for the rebound, but play is swiftly halted for a foul in the build-up, and Atleti escape unscathed."
24',action,"A succession of corners now for Sporting, which allows the hosts to relieve some of the pressure that had been building at the other end. From the second set-piece, Traore gets on the end of Douglas’ looping cross, but Griezmann - of all people - gets across to make a timely block."
22',action,"CLOSE! Two chances in quick succession for the visitors. First, 19-year-old Mere does brilliantly to deny Torres from close-range before, after Sporting failed to clear their lines, Correa flashes a low strike across the face of goal."
21',action,"Sporting have not won two La Liga games in a row in the same season since January 2016 (5-1 vs Real Sociedad an 1-0 vs Valencia). And despite their promising start today, Atleti have now taken control..."
18',action,"A pause in play now, as Burgui has to receive some treatment after a hefty challenge on Vrsaljko. The official did not award Atleti a free-kick, though it appears the Real Madrid-loanee came off worse, having been caught by Vrsaljko’s trailing leg."
16',action,"Atleti have taken a foothold in this game since Griezmann’s effort, and Sporting are struggling to make any inroads going forward at the moment."
13',action,"CLOSE! The first chance of the game goes Atleti’s way, though. It was superb play from Griezmann, who allowed the ball to race across him before unleashing a powerful left-footed effort. Cuellar was beaten, but the ball skipped just wide of the right-hand upright."
11',action,"Sporting, boosted by this encouraging start, are pressing high, not allowing Atleti’s midfield any time or space on the ball. Traore tries to get a shot away from the edge of the area, but the former Monaco man just can’t get the ball out of his feet."
10',action,"Unconvincing goalkeeping from Moya, who is perhaps fortunate to win a free-kick after rushing out to try and claim a corner, only to get his angles all wrong. With the huge frame of Traore up front, Sporting should present a real threat from set-pieces this afternoon."
9',action,"STAT - Sporting are unbeaten against Atleti at El Molinon in their last four games (W2 D2). Their last defeat against them at home was in 2008. The home side have started well today, though Atleti do seem comfortable in sitting back and playing on the counter..."
7',action,"Douglas seems to have been given a free role on the right flank for the hosts today, with the former Barcelona full-back regularly cutting inside to create space for Traore to work the channels. The Ivorian striker uses his strength to hold off Hernandez as he drives towards the area, but Atleti’s defence manage to regain control before Sporting can make anything of it."
5',action,"Neat play from Traore, who holds the ball up well before cutting back into midfield. However, his run is halted inadvertently by the referee, though fortunately for the official, Atleti cannot make anything of the counter-attack."
3',action,"Sporting do well to retain possession under pressure from Atleti’s high-intensity midfield, only for Moi Gomez to play a sloppy pass into the path of Torres. The former Liverpool striker looks to spread it wide out to Vrsaljko, but the Croatian cannot take the ball under his control."
1',action,KICK-OFF! Sporting get proceedings underway in northern Spain.
,action,"Atleti ran-out 5-0 victors in the reverse fixture earlier this season, but Simeone has taken no risks with his strong starting line-up, despite Atleti’s upcoming trip to Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League."
,action,"The visitors have a host of injuries to contend with - Juanfran, Diego Godin and Jan Oblak among the first-team regulars missing today - but still boast an incredibly strong substitutes bench that includes Kevin Gameiro, Nico Gaitan and Jose Gimenez."
,action,"Fernando Torres - who scored and missed a penalty in that game - retains his place up front, with Angel Correa preferred to Saul in midfield. Juanfran is out injured, so Sime Vrsaljko comes in at full-back."
,action,"Two alterations for the hosts, as Rubi drafts in Douglas and Burgui in place of Isma Lopez and Carlos Carmona respectively. Someone, meanwhile, has likewise made just two changes to the Atleti side that rallied late on to beat Celta Vigo last time out."
,action,"TEAM NEWS - Atletico Madrid substitutes: Saul, Gameiro, Partey, Gaitan, Gimenez, Moreira, Henrique."
,action,"TEAM NEWS - Atletico Madrid (4-4-2): Moya; Vrsaljko, Savic, Hernandez, Filipe Luis; Correa, Gabi, Koke, Carrasco; Griezmann, F.Torres."
,action,"TEAM NEWS - Sporting Gijon substitutes: Rodriguez, Castro, Nacho Cases, Echiejile, X.Torres, Cop, Whalley."
,action,"TEAM NEWS - Sporting Gijon (4-2-3-1): Cuellar; Lillo, Mere, Amorebieta, Canella; Alvarez, Vesga; Douglas, Moi Gomez, Burgui; Traore."
,action,"Atleti’s good run has not yet been enough for them to regain a spot in the top three, however, and you feel this is a must-win game for Diego Simeone’s men if they are to apply some pressure to Sevilla - who face Eibar later. Sporting, on the other hand, would move out of the relegation zone should they claim an unlikely three points."
,action,"Atleti have been in fine form since the turn of the year, winning four of their six league fixtures since returning from their winter-break. The same cannot be said for Sporting, however, with Rubi’s side having won just once since December 4. That victory, though, did come in their most-recent LaLiga match - against Leganes last weekend."
