,action,"Blimey, what an end to the game that was! It intially looked as if City were on course to ending Chelsea's winning streak when Cahill turned the ball into the back of his own net, but the league leaders did wonderfully well to fight back and leave the Etihad with a hard-earned victory from a game that has provided us with plenty of talking points."

90'+7',red-card,"Red Card Fernando Luiz Rosa ; ANOTHER RED CARD! It's all kicking off! Fernandinho gets involved and grabs Fabregas by the throat on the side of the pitch, and he too is given his marching orders by the referee. City have totally lost their discipline!"
90'+6',red-card,"Red Card Sergio Leonel Agüero del Castillo ; RED CARD! Aguero loses out to Luiz deep down the left flank and immediately lashes out at the Brazilian with a horrendously high challenge, leaving the defender in a heap on the floor and resulting in a straight red card for the striker."
90'+5',action,"Another City attack breaks down and allows City to fly forward on nother dangerous counter-attack, but Fernandinho darts across the edge of the penalty area to dispossess Moses at the vital moment."
90'+4',substitution,"; Chelsea have made their final substitution of the afternoon, with Batshuayi coming on to take the place of Hazard."

90'+2',action,"A low cross is thumped into the middle of the Chelsea penalty area and finds Toure in front of goal, but the ball is slightly behnid the Ivorian and deflects off his leg before landing safely into the hands of Courtois."
90',goal,"Goal Eden Hazard ; GOAL! Chelsea wrap up the win with another great counter-attack! A half-hearted City attacking move breaks down, allowing Alonso to fire a great lofted pass forward. It flies past Kolarov and finds Hazard, who skips into the City penalty area and slots a low shot past Bravo and into the bottom left-hand corner of the net."
90',assist,"Assist Marcos Alonso Mendoza ; That was a brilliant pick-out by Alonso, but Hazard did wonderfully well to skip past Kolarov, who was far too slow in trying to deal with the Belgian and lacked the pace needed to close him down when required."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be six minutes of added time.
88',action,"Iheanacho picks up the ball in a pocket of space just outside of the Chelsea penalty area and spins quickly before shooting, but his 25-yard strike is mishit and sails well wide of the near post and out for a goal-kick."
87',action,"The home side come back once again before winning themselves yet another corner over on the left wing, but Silva's cross fails to pick out a City player in front of goal and was dealt with by Moses, who was being put under plenty of pressure."
85',substitution,; Costa seems to have picked up an injury and hobbles off the pitch to be replaced by Chalobah for the final five minutes.
84',action,"City keep putting pressure on the Chelsea back line as they desperately try to find an equaliser. They do well to win themselves a corner, which is then curled towards Iheanacho, but the striker's header at the near post fails to trouble Courtois and sails well wide of the goal."
82',action,"The cross from the free-kick is a good one and almost finds Cahill in front of goal, but the defender misses the ball by the narrowest of margins and loses out to Bravo at the vital moment."
81',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Jesús Navas González ; Navas is quickly closed down by Alonso and Hazard over on the left flank and loses out to the latter, but he ends up tugging the Belgian's shirt and gives away a free-kick in a very dangerous position."
80',action,"De Bruyne battles with Hazard deep down the right flank before winning City a corner. It's fired into the middle of the penalty area and finds Otamendi, but the defender sends his header over the top of the crossbar after doing well to beat his marker in the air."
78',substitution,"; City have made another attacking change, with Stones making way for Iheanacho as the home side switch to a 4-4-2 formation."
77',action,"Navas goes down inside the box, but the referee isn't interested! The Spaniard first appeals for a penalty after his low cross seems to strike the arm of Luiz, and he then goes down under a challenge from Alonso, but there didn't seem to be much contact and play is allowed to go on."
76',substitution,; Gundogan is replaced by Toure in City's second substitution of the afternoon.
74',action,"There's another break in play as Willian receives treatment after being caught by Kolarov, but it looks as if the Brazilian is going to be able to continue. It also seems as if Guardiola is about to call on Toure as he tries to find a way back into the game."
72',action,"City are trying everything they can to get back into the game, but Chelsea are doing really well to hold on. This time it's Silva who penetrates the penalty area before unleashing a cross, but Azpilicueta, who has been great today, is there to head the ball away from goal."
70',assist,"Assist Diego Da Silva Costa ; Costa did brilliantly to set up Willian after beating Otamendi, but questions have to be asked of the City defender, who has been poor this afternoon. Costa skipped past him far too easily in the build-up to both goals and has been causing him all sorts of problems."
70',goal,"Goal Willian Borges Da Silva ; GOAL! What a counter-attack by Chelsea! A Gundogan cross is cut out by Fabregas and the visitors immediately break away quickly. Hazard flies forward and tees up Costa, who spins past Otamendi before finding Willian, and the substitute charges into the right-hand side of the box and beats Bravo with a lovely low shot to the goalkeeper's right."
69',substitution,"; City have made their first change of the game, with Sane making way for Clichy."
68',action,"De Bruyne, who has arguably been one of City's best players this afternoon, once again causes problems down the right flank before curling a cross into the Chelsea box, but it's sent too near to Courtois and is easily dealt with by the goalkeeper at the near post."
66',action,"What a block by Moses!

The Belgian quickly sets up Aguero, who then breaks into the box, but he's closed down quickly by Azpilicueta and ends up seeing his thumping shot saved by Courtois."
60',assist,Assist Francesc Fàbregas i Soler ; Assist Francesc Fàbregas i Soler
60',goal,"Goal Diego Da Silva Costa ; GOAL! Chelsea have equalised! An absolutely excellent lofted pass from Fabregas flies over the City back line and finds Costa on the edge of the penalty area. He brings the ball down brilliantly and out-muscles Otamendi far too easily before shooting, and his shot squirms under the body of Bravo and into the back of the net."
58',action,"Willian and Hazard link up brilliantly in the middle of the pitch before the latter skips past Otamendi far too easily. He breaks into the box and then sets up Costa, but the Spaniard is too slow on the ball and is dispossessed before he can shoot from close range."
56',action,"What a miss by De Bruyne! City break away quickly on a brilliant counter-attack before Navas sets up De Bruyne with an excellent low pass across the face of goal, but, from a few yards out, De Bruyne somehow fails to fire the ball into the back of the net and instead smashes it off the crossbar."
55',action,"There's a brief break in play after Aguero goes down inside the Chelsea penalty area clutching his ankle, but, after a few moments on the ground, it looks as if he's going to be able to continue."
54',action,"Almost a terrible mistake by Cahill! A backwards pass from Alonso is left by Cahill, who allows the ball to run through to Courtois. The goalkeeper isn't there to meet it, however, and the ball is picked up inside the penalty area by Aguero, but Cahill rushes back to stop the Argentine's shot from finding the back of the net."
52',action,"Willian makes an immediate impact as he skips past Fernandinho in the middle of the pitch before shooting from 25 yards out, but, like Costa's effort a couple of minutes ago, his strike is poorly hit and Bravo is able to watch it roll comfortably wide of his goal."
50',substitution,"; Conte certainly isn't happy with what he's seen so far, and he's decided to replace Pedro with Willian in Chelsea's first alteration of the afternoon."
50',action,"Chance for Costa! Moses spins past Sane far too easily before teeing up Costa with a clever through-ball. The striker meets the ball well before shooting from just inside the penalty area, but his shot is slightly mishit and ends up flying comfortably wide of the near post."

48',action,"Navas skips down the right flank on a dangerous run before curling a low cross into the middle of the Chelsea box, but Luiz is just about able to thump it out for a corner. The set-piece is sent short and worked back to Navas, who then tries to tee up De Bruyne, but the Spaniard's pass is poor and rolls out of play for a throw-in."
46',action,And we're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"At the other end of the pitch, Chelsea had a couple of chances on goal early on but, overall, have struggled to cause City too many problems. Alonso and Moses have found it difficult to get into the game over on both flanks, leaving Costa largely anonymous for the final 20 minutes of the half."
,action,"Despite being shut out for 44 minutes, it's City who head into the half-time break with a narrow lead thanks to a poor own-goal scored by Cahill. The Chelsea back line had largely done well up until then, particularly as they had to deal with De Bruyne and Silva, both of whom have been excellent so far, and will be extremely frustrated after going behind in such a disappointing way."
,action,HALF-TIME: MANCHESTER CITY 1-0 CHELSEA
45'+2',action,"Chelsea, who have largely been on the back foot for most of the game so far, try to push forward on what will surely be the final attacking move of the half, but he's quickly closed down by Otamendi and Stones and ends up running the ball out of play."
45',own-goal,"Own Goal Gary Cahill ; GOAL! City have taken the lead right on the stroke of half-time! Navas takes on Alonso before whipping a dangerous cross into the middle of the Chelsea penalty area, where it finds Cahill.

45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be two minutes of added time.
43',action,"Excellent tackle by Kante! City come back once again thanks to great work by De Bruyne, who once again picks out Aguero with a wonderful cross. This time the Argentine knocks the ball back to Gundogan, who is in a great position in front of goal, but as soon as he's about to pull the trigger, Kante dispossesses him from behind with a brilliant interception."
42',action,"What a chance for Aguero! A lofted, cross-field pass flies past Alonso and finds Navas, who then tees up De Bruyne. The Belgian is in a pocket of space and quickly curls a beautiful cross right on to the head of Aguero, but, under pressure, his close-range header ends up flying just past the far post."
40',action,"Great tackle by Cahill! Sane, who has largely been quiet this afternoon, embarks on a great run towards the Chelsea penalty area before trying to penetrate the box, but, just as he's about to, Cahill dives in and dispossesses the German with a fantastic sliding tackle."
39',action,"City come back once again after Chelsea are unable to fully clear the danger, but Sane, after doing well to cut inside from the right wing and beat his marker, ends up sending a curling cross over the head of Aguero and out for a goal-kick."
38',action,"Aguero and Luiz battle once again, and this time the striker skips past the defender on the left-hand side of the box before winning City a corner. Silva sends an out-swinger into the penalty area and towards one of many sky blue shirts, but Moses is there to deal with the danger."
36',action,"Chelsea patiently pass the ball around inside the City half of the pitch before Alonso curls a good cross into the heart of the penalty area, where it finds Pedro, but the Spaniard is unable to guide his header towards goal and instead sends it well wide of the goal."
34',action,"What a block by Azpilicueta! Silva picks out Sane with a beautiful lofted pass over the top of the Chelsea back line and into the path of Sane. The German runs into the penalty area before teeing up Aguero with a lovely, first-time pass, but the Argentine's shot from close range fails to beat Azpilicueta on the edge of the six-yard box."
32',action,"Another sloppy piece of play from Azpilicueta almost results in Aguero flying through on goal once again, but, luckily for the Spaniard, Silva's pass towards the striker is poor and easily cut out by Luiz at the vital moment. Unsurprisingly, the Brazilian is booed as soon as he makes contact with the ball."
31',action,"Chelsea immediately break forward and string together a great series of passes before winning themselves a corner over on the left flank, but City, who are still frustrated about the referee's decision not to penalise Luiz, do well to deal with the danger."
30',action,"Big call by the referee! Luiz and Aguero tangle deep inside the Chelsea half of the pitch after a poor attempted back pass from Azpilicueta, sending the Argentine crashing to the ground. The City players and fans all scream for a free-kick and a red card, but the referee isn't at all interested and waves play on."
29',action,"Moses gets forward well down the right flank before firing a low cross off Sane and out for a corner. It's sent short and worked towards the edge of the penalty area before a poked pass finds Luiz in front of goal, but the defender is unable to spin past his marker and is dispossessed before he can either shoot or find a teammate with a pass."
27',action,"Lovely play by City! Silva picks up the ball in the middle of the pitch and immediately chips a beautiful pass over the top of the Chelsea defence and into the path of Aguero. The striker brings the ball down wonderfully before trying to shoot, but Luiz is there to make sure that he can't."
26',action,"And now Hazard goes close! Otamendi misjudges a lofted pass forward and allows it to sail through to Hazard. The Belgian then skips past Bravo and towards the near post, but the angle towards goal is quickly closed down by Stones and forces him into poking the ball back to Pedro. The Spaniard is unable to meet it, however, and loses out at the last moment."
25',action,"City score, but it's ruled out for offside! The home side win themselves a free-kick over on the right flank that is beautifully curled into the heart of the penalty area, where it finds Fernandinho. The Brazilian is completely unmarked in front of goal and easily manages to beat Courtois with a bullet header, but the linesman's flag is rightly raised as soon as the ball hits the back of the net."
24',action,"There's a brief break in play as Pedro receives medical attention after tangling with Aguero in the build-up to City's last attacking move, but it looks as if the Spaniard is going to be able to continue, despite Willian being readied just in case."
22',action,"Great strike by Aguero! Kolarov charges into the Chelsea half of the pitch before teeing up Aguero on the edge of the penalty area. The striker takes a quick touch, spins and then unleashes a rocket of a shot, but Courtois is able to get a finger to it to tip the effort over the top of the crossbar."
20',action,"The free-kick is sent short but quickly lost by Hazard. City then hit Chelsea on another dangerous counter-attack down the right wing, but De Bruyne's attempted pass to Aguero is cut out by Pedro after the Spaniard did well to rush back."
19',action,"Chelsea press City well inside the home side's half of the pitch before winning themselves a throw-in over on the left wing. It's sent to Alonso, who is then brought down by De Bruyne and wins the visitors a free-kick in an advantageous position."
17',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Nicolás Hernán Otamendi ; After dealing with the danger, Chelsea try to break away on a swift counter-attack down the left wing, but Costa is quickly taken out by a hefty sliding challenge from Otamendi, resulting in a yellow card for the centre-back that will see him miss City's next game."
16',action,"Fernandinho wins the bll back deep inside the Chelsea half of the pitch and immediately plays a quick one-two with Silva on the edge of the penalty area. The Brazilian then breaks inside before firing a low cross towards Aguero, but Luiz is there to cut out the danger."
15',action,"Hazard goes close! A poor attempted headed clearance from Stones is quickly picked up by Pedro, who, with his back to goal, spins and finds Hazard. He's in a great position on the edge of the box and immediately unleashes a shot, but it ends up flying just wide of the near post after beating Bravo."
13',action,"Chelsea come back once again as they look to carve out a chance on goal, with Hazard and Costa playing an important role in the attacking move. The duo link up well on the edge of the penalty area before the Belgian tries to tee up Alonso, but his pass is slightly misplaced and is easily dealt with by Navas."
11',action,"Kante and Gundogan battle for the ball over on the right wing as Chelsea try to put pressure on City, who have bossed possession so far, but the Frenchman's boot is slightly too high and clips the City midfielder's ankle, resulting in a free-kick for the home side."
9',action,"Costa darts into the City penalty area before taking on Stones, who holds on to the ball for far too long near to the byline as he tries to out-muscle the striker. The Spaniard eventually dispossesses the defender before teeing up Pedro, but the latter is unable to pick out a teammate and instead pokes the ball to Gundogan."
7',action,"City scream for a penalty, but nothing is given! A poor attempted clearance from Alonso gifts possession to the hosts, who have started brightly. De Bruyne and Silva link up once again before the latter skips into the penalty area and takes on Cahill, but the ball ends up striking the centre-back's arm as he slides into a tackle. The referee waves away City's pleas for a penalty, however, and only awards them a corner."
6',action,"De Bruyne cleverly weaves his way down the right flank as he beats three Chelsea players. He then tees up Silva, who tries to take on Azpilicueta just outside of the penalty area, but the defender comes out on top and does well to poke the ball out for a throw-in."
4',action,"Vital block by Stones! Moses cuts in from the right flank and picks out Hazard with a lovely cross-field pass. The Belgian skips past his marker and plays a quick one-two with Costa before shooting from the edge of the box, but Stones throws his body in the way of the effort to stop it from troubling Bravo."
3',action,"After a few nervy moments for Chelsea, the game gets underway once again as Hazard makes his way back on to the pitch. De Bruyne immediately picks up the ball over on the right wing before trying to thread a clever pass into the path of Aguero, but Luiz holds off the striker to help shepherd the ball into the hands of Courtois."
2',action,"Fernandinho and Hazard battle for the ball in the middle of the pitch before the latter tangles with the Brazilian and crashes to the ground in pain. It looks as if he caught his ankle under the boot of the City man, leaving him in serious discomfort."
1',action,"And we're off! City get us underway, attacking from left to right."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out on to the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."
,action,"Meanwhile, Chelsea boss Antonio Conte has made just one alteration to the team that featured in their last outing, with Cesc Fabregas replacing the injured Nemanja Matic in the heart of midfield to make his first league appearance since the end of September."
,action,"Pep Guardiola has decided to make six changes to the City side that started the win against Burnley last weekend, with John Stones, Ilkay Gundogan, Jesus Navas, David Silva, Kevin De Bruyne and Leroy Sane coming into the starting line-up to replace Bacary Sagna, Gael Clichy, Fernando, Raheem Sterling, Yaya Toure and Nolito in a fluid 3-2-4-1 system."

,action,"Today’s game not only sees two of the league’s top teams take one another but also brings the two most prolific goalscorers. Both Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa have netted 10 times each, with the Argentine scoring twice last weekend to help City see off a determined Burnley side. Costa failed to find the back of the net against Tottenham but scored in each of his previous three league appearances to help Chelsea continue their excellent start to the season."
,action,"Last season’s corresponding fixture saw City comfortably win 3-0 in what would prove to be the beginning of the end for Jose Mourinho. A lot has changed since then, however, and the two sides head to the Etihad with a point to prove as they aim to finish the weekend top of the table. With games against Arsenal and Liverpool fast approaching, City will be particularly desperate to receive a big boost with a positive result here today."
,action,"Antonio Conte’s decision to switch to a 3-4-3 formation has worked wonders for his side, and they start the day top of the table, one point ahead of City. Pep Guardiola’s men have suffered a somewhat stuttering start to the season, but they are nonetheless unbeaten in their previous six games, with their last league defeat coming against Tottenham at the start of October."
,action,"This afternoon’s clash brings together two sides that are almost certain to be battling one another at the top of the table come the end of the season. A wonderful two-month period has seen Chelsea win all of their last seven league games, with last weekend’s victory against Tottenham Hotspur being the only instance during that time that they conceded a single goal."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Premier League game between Manchester City and Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium.
