,action,"FULL-TIME! Real Madrid scrape their way to a 2-1 win over Malaga, courtesy of a brace from Sergio Ramos. Juanpi scored in the second half to make things interesting, but the away side were unable to end their historic run of never winning at the Bernabeu. Less than convincing performance from Los Blancos, but they finally get a win after three matches without one. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+2',action,"Kroos whips in a free-kick from the left-hand side, with Morata nodding wide of the near upright with the aid of a deflection. The resulting corner is curled in by the German, but Luis heads clear of the danger zone easily. Morata is also penalised for pushing over his marker."
90',action,There are four minutes of stoppage time at the end of this clash.
89',action,"Real Madrid earn themselves a free-kick, and they are in absolutely no rush to take it. Real Madrid are happy to take their time and run down the clock. Vazquez is robbed of possession, with Jony trying to scamper down the left, but the ex-Sporting winger is penalised for a push."
87',action,"Real Madrid earn themselves a corner on the right-hand side, which is curled in by Kroos, but Malaga clear at their near post. Moments later, the German tries to bend in a cross from the right again, but Ronaldo heads over the bar."
85',yellow-card,Yellow Card Lucas Vázquez Iglesias ; Yellow card Lucas Vázquez Iglesias
85',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Michael Nicolás Santos Rosadilla ; Santos makes a rather cynical tackle, which earns him a place in the book."
84',action,"Juanpi tries to slide a pass into Santos, but Ramos makes a good interception, with Malaga struggling to put any dangerous balls in behind. Real Madrid's back four haven't been turned all too often in this game."
82',substitution,"; Morata is given a chance to impress in the dying stages, with Benzema jogging off after a frustrating performance."
81',action,"Malaga are trying to play on the front foot and cause some problems, with an equaliser not looking out of the question. Villanueva tries to offer an option down the left-hand side, but then Real Madrid counter. Ronaldo shoots from a tight angle, but Kameni makes a good save."
79',substitution,"; Penaranda takes his leave after chasing a lot of shadows up front, with Michael Santos introduced for the last 10 minutes in the capital."
78',substitution,"; Modric takes his leave, with Kovacic coming into the fray for the dying stages."
78',yellow-card,Yellow Card Ignacio Camacho Barnola ; Camacho picks up a yellow card and will need to watch his step for the last 10 minutes or so.
76',action,"OFF THE POST! Ronaldo is picked out in space on the right-hand side, before hammering a half-volley across goal. It cannons off the inside of the upright and rockets away to safety. The Portugal international can't seem to find the back of the net this afternoon."
74',action,"OFF THE LINE! Kameni is forced to race back to clear the ball away from the danger zone, after seeing an effort clipped over his body in a one-on-one situation. The rebound falls to Ronaldo, whose close-range shot is deflected wide. Moments later, Modric has an effort saved well by Kameni."
73',substitution,"; Juankar limps off with an injury problem, which sees Demichelis make his first league appearance since rejoining Malaga."
72',action,"There is a brief stoppage in play, as Juankar picks up a knock. There are definitely some nerves inside the stadium at the moment, as Real Madrid are just one mistake or magical moment away from throwing this contest away. They may have a game in hand at the top of LaLiga, but they are in a precarious situation."
70',action,"Real Madrid only have 20 minutes to see out at the Bernabeu, with Romero obviously feeling as though his team can battle back to 2-2. Juanpi and Juankar have been causing problems out wide, with Jony adding fresh legs on the left. The hosts' right-hand side is being probed."
68',action,"The home side need a third goal to wrap this game up, as that strike from Juanpi has opened the contest right back up. Given that Real Madrid have lost twice recently, this could be a big mental blow. Ronaldo looks to slide a throughball into Vazquez's pass, but Villanueva intercepts. Moments later, Luis does the same to deny Benzema."
67',substitution,"; Castro is replaced by Jony for the away side, despite starting the second half brightly."
65',action,"Close from Castro! From kick-off, Malaga win the ball back and Castro races into the clear.

Real Madrid counter down the right, with Vazquez cutting onto his left foot, but a shot from the ex-Espanyol winger is blocked."
63',goal,"Goal Juan Pablo Añor Acosta ; GOOOOOOOOAL! JUANPI MAKES IT 2-1! Juankar does brilliantly to burst in between two defenders in the penalty area, but sees a low shot parried away by Navas. The rebound falls to Juanpi, who takes his time to curl home a neat finish."
62',action,"Juankar overlaps down the left and bends in a cross, but Navas is easily able to claim the delivery from almost under his own crossbar. Malaga maintain their pressure, with Nacho putting the ball behind for a corner, but it comes to nothing for the visitors."
60',action,"Nacho sprints down the left-hand side, and drills in a low cross, but Benzema isn't able to get on the end of it. Moments later, Vazquez scampers to the right byline and cuts the ball back, but Mikel slides in well at the near post to intercept."
58',action,"Penaranda manages to take the ball down in the penalty area, and wriggles free of his marker, but a low shot from the Venezuelan trickles into Varane's path. Navas hasn't had much to do in this second-half at all."
56',action,"Nacho scampers down the left-hand side, but a cross from the Spaniard is inaccurate. Malaga are gradually dropping deeper and threatening less, with Zidane's men starting to have real control in this contest."
54',action,"Modric bursts forward and tries to feed Ronaldo in behind, but Mikel makes a good interception. Real Madrid are doing well on the counter-attack, but their final ball in offensive areas has been lacking. Ronaldo and Benzema aren't looking too sharp."
52',action,"Nacho is found overlapping down the left-hand side, but a sweeping cross from the Spaniard is cleared with ease. Moments later, Real Madrid earn themselves a free-kick on the left-hand side, which Kroos swings in, but Ronaldo is caught in an offside position."
50',action,"The away side are struggling to move the ball at a high enough pace to really cause Ramos and Varane any problems, but Real Madrid's second-choice full-backs could be considered as weak points. Penaranda is dropping so deep that he is struggling to get into any shooting positions."
48',action,"Play is slowed briefly, as both Juankar and Camacho spend time on the turf, but both are fine to continue. Real Madrid are pressing high, with Malaga's back four forced into a few mistakes. The hosts open play out to the left, but a cross from Ronaldo is cleared easily."
46',action,"We are underway in the second half! Zidane's men have a two-goal lead, but they aren't out of the woods yet. Malaga have threatened quite regularly, but Romero's men appear to have already missed the chance to frustrate Real Madrid this afternoon."
,action,"HALF-TIME! A brace from Sergio Ramos have Real Madrid in a strong position at the break, as the hosts survived an early onslaught from Malaga to take a 2-0 lead. Castro hit the woodwork for the visitors, before Los Blancos struck the woodwork just before the interval, with this game still wide open."
45'+1',action,"OFF THE BAR! Benzema delivers a cross from the right, with a deflection off Villanueva rattling the frame of the goal from a tight angle, as Real Madrid try to put the contest to bed before the break."
45'+1',action,There is one minute of first-half stoppage time.
45',action,"Camacho is left nursing his head, after diving into a sliding tackle on Benzema, but the Malaga midfielder will be fine to continue. It appears that the Spaniard was caught on the side of his forehead."
43',assist,"Assist Toni Kroos ; Kroos curls in a free-kick and Ramos gets on the end of it well. Very inviting delivery from the Germany international, and that's his second assist of the afternoon."
43',goal,"Goal Sergio Ramos García ; GOOOOOOOOAL! RAMOS MAKES IT 2-0! Kroos' free-kick finds the Real Madrid captain bearing down on goal, with a flicked finish from the centre-back wrongfooting Kameni. The ball bobbles over the goal-line, despite Malaga's complaints of offside."
42',action,"Rosales gives away a free-kick on the right-hand side, with Nacho coming off worse after a clash of knees. Kroos is allowed the chance to bend in a cross from the left-hand side for the hosts."
40',action,"Wide from Ramos! A free-kick is floated in from the right-hand side, but this time the centre-back can't find the back of the net with his head. Fortunately for the Spain international, his blushes are spared due to an offside flag."
39',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Juan Carlos Pérez López ; Juankar picks up a booking, after Vazquez easily sidestepped a challenge from the left-back and forced him into a cynical trip."
38',action,"The home side are happy to slow things down and retain possession, as Real Madrid have less than 10 minutes to navigate before the break. Fornals and Juanpi are continuing to cause problems in between the lines."
37',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Carlos Henrique Casimiro ; Casemiro picks up a yellow card due to a late, crunching tackle on Fornals. The Brazilian is no stranger to a booking this season."
35',assist,"Assist Toni Kroos ; Kroos curls a great corner into the box, which manages to find Ramos in a pocket of space."
35',goal,"Goal Sergio Ramos García ; GOOOOOOOOOAL! RAMOS MAKES IT 1-0! The Real Madrid captain meets a corner delivery from the right with his head, firing a tremendous effort into the back of the net. Kameni got nowhere near it. Great goal, but Malaga's marking was very poor indeed."
34',action,"Malaga continue to create a lot of chances, with Romero's men happy to press high and force a few mistakes. Ronaldo is found out on the left for Real Madrid, and feeds a pass infield, which Casemiro opens out to the right. Vazquez tries to bend in a cross, but a deflection off Juankar earns the hosts a corner."
33',action,"Sergio Ramos is lucky to get away with shoving his marker in the throat, as plenty of players jostle in the box for a Real Madrid corner. That could easily have been seen as a red-card offence. Moments later, Vazquez is the target of a ball over Juankar's head, but the Spaniard can't manage to keep it in play."
31',action,"This time, Malaga deliver a corner from the left-hand side, but Juanpi's ball in is nodded wide of the far post by Camacho! That was very close, the Spanish midfielder peeled off into space brilliantly. As we tick over the half-hour mark, both sides are looking likely to grab the opener."
29',action,"Malaga are holding their own so far, with Marcelo looking very annoyed on the touchline after being substituted with what appeared to be a muscle problem. Penaranda manages to win a corner from Varane, before Casemiro heads the set-piece delivery behind for a second one."
27',action,"Benzema shoots wide! Ronaldo cuts back from the left-hand side, and picks out the France international on the edge of the box, but his volleyed effort sails just shy of the top-right corner. This is an incredibly open game, both goalkeepers have had a lot to do."
25',substitution,"; Marcelo takes his leave, with the Brazil international unable to shake off the earlier injury problem. Isco is put into the fray, which sees Nacho switch to his more familiar position of left-back."
25',action,"Good effort from Vazquez! The Spaniard gets in behind Juankar with ease, before powering a near-post attempt goalwards! Kameni has to dive to his left to parry the ball to safety. All of Real Madrid's dangerous attacks have come down the right. Malaga respond with a counter-attack, but Penaranda is beaten to a Juanpi cross."
23',action,"The away side break down the right, with Juanpi trying to skip beyond Marcelo, but Casemiro covers across to dispossess the Venezuela international. Real Madrid's Brazilian defender goes down while trying to tackle the Malaga midfielder, but appears okay to continue."
21',action,"Vazquez is involved yet again, as Real Madrid break forward, but Kameni gobbles up his cross from the right easily. Malaga are moving the ball quite well, with Castro and Juanpi floating around dangerously in behind Penaranda. Castro attempts to find his striker in the box, but a terrible delivery sails straight out of play."
19',action,"Good stop from Navas! Penaranda manages to turn within the box, finding Castro in a position to shoot, but the ex-Real Sociedad winger fires an effort straight down the goalkeeper's throat! The hosts are struggling slightly here, and Romero will be very pleased with how his team have started at the Bernabeu. Fornals has a half-chance, but Navas claims his shot easily."
17',action,"Castro has a chance to shoot from the edge of the box, but his low strike can only kiss the inside of the post! The rebound is eventually worked out to Juanpi, but the Venezuela international blasts over the bar. Malaga almost edge ahead."
16',action,"Wide from Benzema! Vazquez is found making tracks down the right yet again, with a curling delivery picking out the Frennchman brilliantly. Instead of just slotting the ball home, he attempts a fancy flick, which he does terribly with. Strange decision!"
14',action,"Half chance for Penaranda! The ex-Granada forward is picked out by a cross, but fails to shoot on target, with Fornals doing brilliantly with the rebound. The young midfielder juggles the ball over Nacho's head, but is then unable to test Navas with a close-range shot from a tight angle."
13',action,"Kameni is off his line in a flash to deny Ronaldo, as Malaga continue to struggle to keep the hosts at bay. The goalkeeper makes a tidy save, but the Real Madrid forward will be disappointed that he didn't do better with that opportunity. Romero's men try to respond, but a long, searching throughball is far too heavy for Penaranda to catch up with."
12',action,"Vazquez bends in a good cross from the right-hand side, which Benzema meets with his head. The Frenchman's effort bounces off the turf, before looping over the crossbar and onto the roof of the net. That is probably the best chance of the game thus far, as the ex-Lyon man was found in plenty of space."
10',action,"Ronaldo is the target of a ball out to the left-hand side, but the Portugal international is unable to keep it in play at the byline. Malaga break down their own left flank, with Juankar and Castro working well together, but Casemiro shuffles across to make a good challenge. Moments later, Vazquez takes a cross-cum-shot from the right, but Kameni parries the ball to safety."
8',action,"Penaranda is yet to get any good service into feet, though the away side have managed to retain possession quite well within their back four. Kroos opens play out to the right-hand side, with Vazquez and Nacho combining, but a cross from the winger is cut out easily by Villanueva."
6',action,"Juanpi tries to wriggle his way beyond Ramos, but the Real Madrid captain tackles his adversary strongly. The hosts are unafraid to get stuck in during these early exchanges, but Malaga are holding their nerve in the face of pressing and aggression. Ronaldo almost manages to rob Kameni of the ball, even!"
4',action,"Romero will be pleased with how his charges have started in the Spanish capital, as they are pressing quite high and giving Real Madrid problems in their build-up play. Rosales sprints down the right for the visitors, but a searching cross from the Venezuelan is cleared ahead of Penaranda."
2',action,"Vazquez escapes down the right-hand side, but the Spaniard can only cross into Kameni's arms due to a deflection off Juankar. Malaga are happy to try and retain possession with composure, with a few niggling fouls characterising the early minutes here."
