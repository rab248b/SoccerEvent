,action,"That's all for our live coverage, thanks for following along. Goodbye!"
,action,"An Ahmed Elmohamady own goal put City ahead in the first half and they never looked back, as Raheem Sterling took the match over, setting up Sergio Aguero and Fabian Delph for second-half goals as Pep Guardiola's side strengthen their grip on a place in the top four. Hull pulled one back late through Andrea Ranocchia, which is more than just consolation, as every goal counts for them in their fight for survival."
90'+3',action,FULL-TIME: MANCHESTER CITY 3-1 HULL CITY.
90'+1',action,"Decent effort! City win a free-kick high up the pitch and Kolarov is the one to take. The Serbian drives a venomous effort at goal with that wicked left foot of his, but Jakupovic is able to beat it away at the near post."
90',action,There will be three minutes added on at the end of this match.
89',action,"City are looking vulnerable all of a sudden in the dying embers of this match. Grosicki goes down with a decent shout for a penalty, but Jonathan Moss wasn't interested. The last thing City want is to concede again and make this a nervy finish all of a sudden, after having a walk in the park for the entirety of this second half."
87',action,"STAT: Since Marco Silva was appointed Hull manager on January 5th, the Tigers have won 17 points in the Premier League – only Chelsea (23), Spurs (23) and Everton (21) have won more in this period. This is one more than Man City (16) since then, but they have played one more game."
85',assist,Assist Shaun Maloney ; Maloney picks up an assist within three minutes of coming on.
85',goal,"Goal Andrea Ranocchia ; HULL PULL ONE BACK! Is the comeback on? No, of course not, but it's still a big goal for the Tigers as far as goal difference is concerned. Malone makes an immediate impact as he drives down the left and pulls it back for Ranocchia. The centre-half stabs an effort towards goal and Bravo makes an absolute meal of it, somehow letting it through! Dreadful from the keeper, that."
84',action,"Two more shooting chances for City, as all of a sudden they look in the mood for another. Delph sees an effort deflected narrowly behind, before Aguero comes close moments later. City are cruising through to the final whistle and they're being serenaded along the way by these delighted supporters."
82',substitution,; Hull's final change sees Shaun Maloney come on for Niasse.
82',action,"DOUBLE CHANCE! City continue to use their width expertly today! Navas makes strides down the right again and whips in a cross that just eludes the head of Aguero! It's kept in play on the left flank the ball is played in again, but this time the cross-cum-shot drifts beyond the far corner."
80',action,"There's a whole lot of nothing happening out on the pitch as we enter the final 10 minutes. City are understandably relaxed in possession, not showing much desire to push forward and add to their lead. Hull aren't fighting back much either, probably worried about angering the beast that is this City attack."
78',action,"Hull are hardly managing more than a few consecutive touches on the ball, struggling mightily to string any passes together. Their away form has been abysmal this season and hasn't improved much under Marco Silva - probably the only facet of their game the Portuguese manager hasn't managed to correct."
76',action,"City have closed up shop, working the ball around calmly as Hull give up their fight. The Tigers have accepted the result and have shifted into damage control, with their main focus over the final 20 minutes is to not concede a fourth."
74',substitution,"; A third and final substitution of the match for the hosts here, as Toure gives way to Fernando."
73',substitution,"; David Silva's 300th appearance for the club comes to an end as the skipper walks off to a standing ovation from these City supporters, as he's replaced by Iheanacho."
71',action,"STAT: Manchester City have been beaten just once in nine previous Premier League games against Hull City, a 1-2 loss in February 2010 (W5 D3)."
69',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Alfred John Momar N'Diaye ; There's only one way to stop Sterling this afternoon, and N'Diaye shows us how right there. The midfielder is beat, so he holds onto the back of the attacker for dear life, before draping both arms around him and tackling him to the ground. Lovely improvisation."
66',substitution,; City's first change sees Nolito replace Sane.
64',assist,"Assist Raheem Shaquille Sterling ; Sterling has been outstanding today, absolutely dominating down that right flank, and he's got an assist to show for his efforts."
64',goal,"Goal Fabian Delph ; OUTSTANDING FINISH! City have their third and the points are in the bag now, surely! Sterling, because who else, makes waves down the right once again before picking out Delph atop the box, and the midfielder rifles a superb finish into the far corner!"
62',action,STAT: Sergio Aguero has scored 10 goals in his last 10 appearances for Manchester City in all competitions.
60',action,"We have reached the hour mark at the Etihad, and it's all sort of fizzled out. It's not just the tempo which has gone, but the intensity and intent as well. City are lazily keeping possession and Hull are showing no real desire to press and win it back."
58',substitution,; The other change sees Markus Henriksen replace Sam Clucas.
58',substitution,"; A pair of substitutions for Hull as Marco Silva brings on some attacking reinforcements. Abel Hernandez comes on to resume his partnership with Niasse up top, replacing Evandro."
56',action,"The out-of-town scoreboard presents good news for both these clubs, as Liverpool trail 1-0 at Stoke, and Swansea are losing by the same scoreline away to West Ham. Should these results hold, City would move into third place, while Hull would remain above the drop."
54',action,"More than an uphill climb now for Hull, who have to shift their focus to not doing further damage to their goal difference. If this 2-0 result stays the same, the Tigers would move to -31, which would be the worst mark in the Premier League - an ominous sign should the relegation scrap come down to a tiebreaker."
52',action,"STAT: Manchester City have lost only one of their last 17 Premier League games at the Etihad Stadium (W9 D7 L1), with that defeat coming at the hands of league leaders Chelsea in December."
50',action,"NEARLY ANOTHER! Almost a second own goal for Hull as Sterling rips through the defence yet again! He's carving through this backline like a hot knife through butter. Again his low cross is excellent, and Jakupovic has to produce a fantastic save to deny a second own goal!"
48',goal,"Goal Sergio Leonel Agüero del Castillo ; CITY COME FLYING OUT OF THE GATE! They couldn't have drawn it up much better, as minutes after the restart, City double their lead! Once again the move is orchestrated down the right, as Sterling carves the defence apart and somehow squeezes a low cross through to Aguero, who keeps his composure and finishes through a crowd of bodies on the line!"
46',action,Back underway in Manchester!
,action,"An own goal from Ahmed Elmohamady has City deservedly ahead at the interval. Still everything to play for, but the hosts look to be comfortably in charge for now, enjoying over 70 per cent possession in that first half."
45'+1',action,HALF-TIME: MANCHESTER CITY 1-0 HULL CITY.
45',action,The fourth official indicates there will be one minute added on at the end of this first half.
43',action,"City patiently pass the ball around as we approach half-time. They're parked in the attacking half, but struggling to find a way through to grab the second goal that might just put this game to bed. City's only threatening attacks of the afternoon have been orchestrated out wide - not once have they successfully build through the centre."
41',action,"This really has been a weird first half at the Etihad. It's been consistently open, with a respectable, upbeat tempo, but all that considered, you would expect a lot more scoring chances. There really hasn't been a whole lot for either keeper to do despite the lively nature of the match."
39',action,"STAT: Since picking up three points in their first away game of the season (2-0 at Swansea City), Hull City have won just two points in 14 Premier League away games since (W0 D2 L12)."
37',action,"TIDY BREAK! Another nearly moment for Hull, who will be frustrated with the amount of them they've had in the last few minutes. Evandro wins a challenge on Toure to start a break, which ends at the feet of Grosicki, who cuts inside on his right and bends an effort just wide of the far post!"
35',action,"CLOSE! Great play from Sterling, who picks up the ball near the corner flag with absolutely no supoort out wide or in the centre. He manages to hold onto it and wait for teammates to arrive, before picking out Silva in the centre, but the Spaniard's sliding volley lifts just over the bar!"
33',action,"Hull respond really well and nearly pull level straight away! Grosicki finds himself in a nice pocket of space on the left and sends a ball into the centre. It deflects straight to Niasse, who has a clean look at goal from six yards, but can't sort his footing and get the shot off! He really has to be rustling the back of the net there!"
31',own-goal,"Own Goal Ahmed Eissa El Mohamady Abdel Fattah ; HULL ARCHITECT THEIR OWN DOWNFALL! A lovely move from City orchestrated down the right through Silva and Navas. The later sends a cross in which is just over the head of Aguero, but turned in at the far post by... Elmohamady! A real head in the hands moment from the full-back who looks to the heavens in disbelief."
29',action,"FINE SAVE! Strong hands from Jakupovic who stays with Toure's strike to parry it over the bar! It was a good hit from the City midfielder, but a bit too central, which allowed Jakupovic to get a hand to it."
28',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Evandro Goebel ; Late challenge from Evandro, who slides in a takes out Aguero at the edge of the box. It's an unnecessary challenge from the Hull City player, as Aguero had the ball running away from goal and appeared set to pass it off - but now it's a great chance for City from the free-kick."
27',action,"STAT: The Tigers have scored just two goals in their last 11 Premier League away games, despite attempting 114 shots (41 on target)."
25',action,"NOT FAR AWAY! Sane pulls the ball back cleverly after a good run down the left, and it deflects kindly into the path of Toure, who measures the angle, opens up and bends one towards the far corner. He's scored numerous goals just like this, but gets the height wrong time time as he lifts it a foot or so over the bar."
23',action,"Delph lashes an effort wildly over the bar on the half-volley, which elicits a bit of a groan from the home supporters. Their disappointment is compounded moments later as the midfielder wins the ball back in an advanced position, takes a few steps forward and gets another shot off, but despite keeping this effort down, it's driven miles wide of the near post."
21',action,"The final ball has been lacking in this first half. There's been no real consistency in the final third at the end of these attacks. Both sides are making frequent waves down the flank, attacking with excellent width, but the balls in from these wide areas have been incredibly poor."
19',action,"There's a willing openness about this match. Both teams are aware of it and content with playing out this way, keen to attack in numbers and not overly fretting about leaving themselves a bit thin at the back. Hull are heavy underdogs this afternoon and they appear to be taking the 'we have nothing to lose' approach."
17',action,STAT: Man City could draw three consecutive Premier League home games for the second time this season under Pep Guardiola. They never drew three in a row under Manuel Pellegrini or Roberto Mancini.
15',action,"Hull win a corner and the ensuing delivery causes all sorts of chaos in the area. After a scramble, it falls incredibly kindly for Niasse, just a few yards out, but the whistle sounds. Hull are shouting for a handball, and there did appear to be one, but the striker was also offside, which trumps the handball in the referee's mind as City are awarded a free-kick."
13',action,"Hull are doing well in defence, largely because they aren't panicking. When under pressure they have done very well to keep their cool and remain organised, taking away the passing lanes and tracking the movement off the ball rather impressively."
11',action,"Sane and Sterling have been refreshingly direct on the flanks, getting after these full-backs and making for a few nervy moments in the Hull defence. Aguero was involved in that wonderful move to play through Silva, but otherwise he hasn't received much service in the opening stages."
9',action,"City are imposing themselves here, dominating possession and really taking the game to Hull. Sterling is picked out by a long ball over the top and settles for a corner. The ensuing delivery is played short for Silva, but Niasse tracks back excellently to dispossess the Spaniard and start the other way."
7',action,"STAT: Hull City’s last win in any competition away at Manchester City was in the FA Cup in February 1930, drawing three and losing seven since then."
5',action,"DOUBLE SAVE! Not sure how City haven't scored there, but Jakupovic does his part to keep this game scoreless! Silva is played through by Aguero and gets a shot off from in close, which is stopped by the keeper, before Sane is denied as well on the rebound from point-blank range! Excellent goalkeeping from Jakupovic, but the follow-up from Sane really has to be put away."
3',action,"It's a absolutely beautiful afternoon in Manchester, and the fans are out in full force to support City's quest to stay in the top-four. Both sides show some good intent from the off, with Sterling and Markovic each piecing together impressive runs to test the opposing defence."
1',action,"AND THEY'RE OFF! Hull get us underway, attacking left to right."
,action,"Marco Silva makes a pair of changes from Wednesday's massive win over Boro. Michael Dawson comes in at the back as Harry Maguire misses out with a knock, while Evandro is brought in to replace Abel Hernandez, who starts on the bench after suffering a dead leg in midweek."
,action,"Pep Guardiola makes four changes from Wednesday's defeat at Stamford Bridge. Willy Caballero, Vincent Kompany and Kevin de Bruyne drop to the bench as Claudio Bravo, Alex Kolarov and Raheem Sterling are restored, while Yaya Toure comes back into the XI at the expense of Fernandinho, who is left out of the squad."

,action,CONFIRMED TEAM NEWS:
,action,"Hull’s outlook has improved drastically thanks to wins from three of their last four, including a 4-2 triumph in Wednesday’s huge six-pointer against Middlesbrough. The Tigers still have some ways to go to secure their place in the top-flight next season, but suddenly the goal is feasible."

,action,"Pep Guardiola’s side enter tonight’s contest in fourth, two points back of third-place Liverpool and four up on both Arsenal and Manchester United. Three points are a must for them today as the schedule gets much tougher as April wears on, leading up to the Manchester derby on the 27th."
,action,"Manchester City had their already razor-thin title hopes dashed in Wednesday’s 2-1 defeat to runaway leaders Chelsea at the bridge, as their focus now shifts to securing a spot in the top four – or ideally the top three – and having a real go at the FA Cup."
