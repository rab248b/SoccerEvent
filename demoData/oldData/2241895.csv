,action,"Full-time at the Stadium of Light. Sunderland claim another MASSIVE three points at home as they eventually secure a narrow 2-1 win over current champions, Leicester. A Huth own-goal and a strike from Defoe gave the hosts the lead, while an Okazaki consolation made things dodgy for the Black Cats, but Moyes' men eventually held on for the win."
90'+4',action,"A mammoth goalmouth scramble ensues inside the Sunderland box as the home side eventually, somehow, survive despite numerous shots on goal. Simpson and Morgan both have cracks from inside the penalty area, with the second brilliantly saved by Pickford, and the third going for a goal-kick!!"
90'+2',action,"Sunderland are doing well to run down the clock at the moment, and this is partly due to Simpson who is still carrying that injury, meaning Leicester are effectively down to 10 men. Anichebe is attaching himself to the right-back, who isn't putting up much resistance."
90',action,A generous SIX minutes of injury tme have been allocated by the referee here which will certainly be a cause for optimism for Leicester who have one final ray of hope before the end of play. Can Sunderland hold on?
88',action,"It is the walking wounded out there now as Simpson has picked up an injury after taking a knock. There is a further problem now though as Ranieri has already made his three substitutions, which means the right-back will have to power through for another few minutes. Not ideal."
86',action,"Time is running out for Leicester to try and claim something, anything for this game. That injury to Watmore has put a dampner on proceedings towards the end of play, but the Foxes will still be hoping to spoil the party of Sunderland by claiming a late equaliser, even if the result comes second in importance to Watmore."
84',substitution,; Watmore won't be able to continue here and his replacement is Javier Manquillo. We really hope that injury isn't too serious for the young Englishman.
82',action,This does not look good for Watmore at the moment as he wend down on a heap on the pitch after that challenge from Fuchs. There wasn't anything particularly sinister involved in the altercation. but he young Sunderland man landed very awkwardly on his knee and then ankle. He receives treatment from the physios as we will have a break in play.
81',yellow-card,Yellow Card Christian Fuchs ; Fuchs is booked for a late challenge on Watmore.
80',assist,Assist Demarai Gray ; The substitutes combine for Leicester as Gray gains the assist.
80',goal,"Goal Shinji Okazaki ; GOOOOAAAAAAALLL FOR LEICESTER! A ray of hope for the Foxes! Gray opens up his stride down the left wing and takes on the full-back before smashing a cracking a superb cross to the front post, where Okazaki gets ahead of the defender to divert home with a delightful finish! Two-one - GAME ON."
78',yellow-card,Yellow Card Papiss Mison Djilobodji ; Yellow for Djilobodji.
77',goal,"Goal Jermain Defoe ; GOOOOAAAALLL! GOOOAAALL FOR SUNDERLAND! The hosts double the lead! Watmore seeks out a threatening position inside the Leicester penalty box and receives the ball to feet before firing a strike at goal, which is blocked. However, Defoe pounces on the rebound and fires a strike beyond Zieler into the net! Two-nil."
75',action,"Watmore evades the attentions of Amartey in the middle of the park before clipping a searching pass over the top of the defence, with Defoe the target. The former Spurs striker battles with strength alongside Morgan, but the towering Leicester centre-back typically comes out on top with a solid bit of defending."
73',substitution,; The second sees Demarai Gray come on for Albrighton.
73',substitution,"; Last throw of the dice from Ranieri now as he makes his last two changes in the last portion of play. The first sees the introduction of the speedy winger, Ahmed Musa, in place of the disappointing Mahrez, who really has looked out-of-sorts this season."
72',yellow-card,Yellow Card Sebastian Larsson ; Booking for Larsson.
70',action,"Twenty minutes to go in the second period and Sunderland still look the most likely team to go on and claim the second, and potentially game-winning second goal. They are being helped by the home fans who are urging them forward at each and every opportunity to try and wrap up the vital three points."
68',substitution,"; First change of the match for Leicester now and it has certainly been coming as Shinji Okazaki enters the action to replace Slimani, who has been disappointing."
68',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Patrick van Aanholt ; It has been an eventful few minutes for Van Aanholt as moments after appealing for a penalty, he is booked for diving, and rightly so."
66',action,"SURELY A PENALTY FOR SUNDERLAND! Van Aanholt exchanges a lovely one-two with his team-mate on the left channel before bursting his way into the penalty area, only to be tripped up under the retreating challenge of Simpson! The referee FAILS to point to the spot, rather incredibly!"
64',own-goal,"Own Goal Robert Huth ; GOOOOAAALLL! GOOAAALLL FOR SUNDERLAND! Larsson whips in a corner from the right wing and as Anichebe rises high to nod into the danger area, the ball cannons off the knee of Huth and nestles perfectly into the back of the net! The Stadium of Light ERUPTS! One-nil."
62',action,"Morgan versus Anichebe has been a particularly entertaining duel so far this afternoon, with physicality definitely the main factor between the two. Both of them are giving as good as they are getting but the Leicester captain needs to be more careful than his opponent with all the pushing and shoving."
60',action,"Some worrying scenes for Leicester at the moment as Slimani is now down on the pitch after taking a sore one from Jones just on the edge of the Sunderland box. It was certainly high from the right-back, but probably not enough for the time given to the Algerian going down. He'll be fine."
58',action,"Very, very ambitious from Anichebe this time as the former Everton striker has a crack at goal from just about 35 yards out. There wasn't much else on, and he is arguably the most confidence he has been in his career at the moment, but that was a bit of a waste all the same."
56',action,"Defoe comes deep to see a bit more of the ball and eventually pops a pass out wide to Watmore, who subsequently crosses into the box. Anichebe strives to get on the end of it, but the Sunderland fans breath a sigh of frustration as possession floats out harmlessly for a Leicester goal-kick."
54',action,"BRILLIANT BLOCK FROM KONE! Some excellent work from Albrighton now as he takes on Jones with a speedy dribbly before reversing a perfect cross to the centre of the box. Slimani meets it with a well-connected strike, but the Sunderland defender is positioned right to make the VITAL block a few yards out."
52',action,"Mahrez receives the ball to feet inside the centre circle and shows a cracking bit of skill to lose the attentions of his marker, but Leicester are quickly awarded the free-kick as Larsson concedes the foul. The Algerian takes it with haste as Vardy gains possession before bursting into space on the left."
50',action,"Leicester should have some confidence going into the second period as they can't really play as badly as they did in the opening 45 minutes. If Vardy, and Slimani in particular can get into this a little more, then the Foxes will fancy their chances of perhaps getting the win."
48',action,"Here is hoping we see some goals this afternoon, and we have indeed witnessed an increased tempo after the break. You would think that there must have been an injury to Denayer in the first half as he was impressive before being took off by Moyes."
46',substitution,; The second sees Sebastian Larsson enter the action to replace Pienaar.
46',substitution,"; Two changes to report here, both from Sunderland manager David Moyes. The first sees Jan Kirchhoff replace Jason Denayer."
46',action,We are back under way at the Stadium of Light!
,action,"Half-time at the Stadium of Light. After a promising start, Sunderland failed to capitalise on their dominance and allowed Leicester to grow in confidence, as we enter the break at a 0-0 stalemate."
45'+1',action,"Originally, the referee added on just two minutes of injury time but due to Albrighton and Pienaar going down, the first half has just been extended by a few moments."
44',action,"A small break in play at the moment as Albrighton and Pienaar are currently down injured after a nasty clash of heads just outside the centre circle. The referee takes no chances and quickly waves the physios on, but the duo should be okay to continue after some attention as they are thankfully already moving around."
42',action,"Amartey collects the ball in the middle of the park and slides a pass wide to Albrighton, but the former Aston Villa winger is forced back to pass to Simpson as Sunderland get into defensive positions quickly. The game desperately needs an increase in tempo and intensity after the break."
40',action,"Not a lot of quality in the game here as the lull continues. A promising start to proceedings has fizzled out rather quickly, which will come as a real source of frustration for the Stadium of Light faithful who will be wondering just how they haven't witnessed their side take the lead."
38',action,"This quiet period will be worrying for Moyes in the dugout because his team does indeed run the risk of not capitalising on their dominance of this first half. Leicester will gain confidence from going into the break with the stalemate still intact, and they are on course to do so."
36',action,"Jason Denayer has been somewhat of a revelation since coming into the Sunderland midfield, even though he plays mainly as a striker. The Belgian has looked solid today too and on this occasion shows an impressive bit of strength to ease Slimani off the ball down the right wing."
34',action,"There is a little bit of a lull in the match at the moment as both sides struggle to put together any kind of meaningful offence going forward. It is a bit of a midfield battle currently, but Sunderland are still edging it with the Stadium of Light faithful still in full voice."
32',action,"A dodgy moment at the back from Sunderland as Djilobodji battles alongside Vardy, seemingly awaiting Pickford to come off his line to claim. In the end, the goalkeeper makes his way out from his goal to claim, and takes a whack from Slimani in the process."
30',action,"Mahrez hasn't looked in the game so far this afternoon. Vardy initially does really well to turn sharply in the middle of the park before opening up his considerable stride into the final third. He attempts to find the Algerian at the far post, but the run never comes and Sunderland get the goal-kick."
28',action,"Excellent defending from Huth, who displays a nice bit of vision just to spot the run of Defoe and intercept the attempted pass through from Watmore. This Leicester defence just looking a little more sturdy now."
26',action,"The only negative, apart from actually scoring, for Sunderland is that they haven't managed to get Defoe into the game too much in those predatory areas. If the centre-forward got on to some of the chances that fell to the likes of Watmore and Anichebe it could have been 1-0."
24',action,"We are just beyond the midway point of the first half now and Sunderland will feel unlucky that they haven't managed to open the scoring so far, while the lost penalty appeal will not do wonders for their mental state."
22',action,"Mahrez, who has been pretty poor so far, attempts to affect the game positively for the Foxes by going on a signature run down the right wing before hitting the byline. However, the subsequent cross into the area is deflected harmlessly into the arms of the grateful Pickford between the sticks."
20',action,"WATMORE! HOW CLOSE WAS THAT?! The young Sunderland academy graduate has been the best player on the pitch so far, and almost opens the scoring here with a lashed attempt at goal from 25 yards, but unfortunately for him it is flashed wide of the post. Zieler certainly looked beaten between the sticks!"
18',action,"Mahrez drifts in from the right wing and collects the ball to feet around 20 yards out. The Algerian dazzles with a few nice touches before firing a strike at goal, but Djilobodji stands up solidly and ends up making an important block inside the penalty area."
16',action,"A bit better from Leicester at the moment as they begin to see a bit more of the ball in those central areas. The Foxes are of course without their star central midfield duo of last season, Kante and Drinkwater, this afternoon so King and Amartey need to step up to be counted."
14',action,"The Sunderland fans have a point with that one, that looked a spotkick!"
13',action,"The Sunderland fans are begging the referee to award a penalty here as they believe Anichebe is being hauled to the floor by Huth, who does have previous in such altercations. The play is waved on though and Morgan actually saves the visitors with a superb block from the striker."
11',action,"Sunderland continue to keep the ball patiently in midfield but as we all know from last season, this could potentially be playing into the hands of Leicester who love to play on the counter. The Black Cats need to score in this period of dominance or they risk allowing the visitors back into contention."
9',action,"Moyes and Ranieri are both right out to the front of their dugouts handing out instructions, but for very different reasons. The former is shouting encouragement, while the Italian veteran is trying to arrest the current slump of his charges as they attempt to curb the ascendancy of the hosts."
7',action,"Watmore has been absolutely superb here and continues to take the game to Leicester with bursting runs down the right-hand side. Fuchs looks unable to deal with the young Englishman at the moment, with Sunderland focusing their attacks down that channel."
5',action,"Leicester need to sort themselves out quickly here as they are yet to come out of the blocks. Slimani and Vardy certainly can pose a threat up top, but not if the midfield of the Foxes continues to sit extremely deep alongside the defence."
3',action,"A cracking start to proceedings from Sunderland here, who are eager to take the lead early on. Anichebe almost breaks the deadlock with an attempt from 12 yards, but it is blocked over the crossbar by Morgan."
1',action,We are under way at the Stadium of Light!
,action,"Leicester subs: Hamer, Hernandez, Musa, Schlupp, Okazaki, Gray, Mendy."
,action,"Leicester (4-4-2): Zieler; Simpson, Huth, Morgan, Fuchs; Mahrez, Amartey, King, Albrighton; Slimani, Vardy."

,action,TEAM NEWS...
,action,"Sunderland, meanwhile, have continued their seemingly perennial battle to avoid the drop and once again find themselves rooted to the table, this time with just eight points recorded from 13 matches. David Moyes' charges can take some confidence from the fact they are in relatively decent form, however, as they have claimed six out of the last nine points available, with a loss against Liverpool hardly damaging to morale last weekend."
,action,"As of yet, Leicester have been unable to maintain a good balance between Champions League football, which is entirely foreign to them, and their championship defence as at the moment they are currently closer to the relegation zone than the top four. Their best moments this campaign have come in Europe as they are on course to top the group having already secured qualification to the knockout stages."
,action,"Historically in the Premier League, this match would generally be considered to be a fixture in the lower echelons of the table, but we are witnessing the shock champions of last season this afternoon as Claudio Ranieri's men put in a desperate attempt to reclaim their title."
,action,Good afternoon football fans! Welcome to LIVE coverage of the English Premier League encounter between Sunderland and Leicester from the Stadium of Light.
