,action,"It wasn't the prettiest or most convincing of performances from Inter, but they nonetheless just about did enough to leave the Mapei with three hard-earned and much-needed points to help continue their climb up the table. Sassuolo fought diligently and will be frustrated that they were unable to hold the Nerazzurri to at least a draw, but they can still take plenty of positives into their next clash against Cagliari on Thursday. Inter, meanwhile, must face Lazio in what is set to be a fierce encounter just before Christmas."
,action,FULL-TIME: SASSUOLO 0-1 INTER
90'+4',action,"Late opportunity by Iemmello! The ball dangerously bounces around the Inter penalty area as Sassuolo desperately try to carve out a last-minute chance on goal, but Iemmello is unable to guide his thumping half-volley through the wall of white shirts camped just in front of him."
90'+3',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Gabriel Barbosa Almeida ; Gabriel breaks through the Sassuolo defence as he charges towards the penalty area, but he's flagged offside just as he's about to take on Consigli. The Brazilian then fires the ball into the back of the net in frustration and receives a yellow card for dissent."
90'+2',yellow-red,"Yellow/Red Felipe Melo de Carvalho ; RED CARD! Melo clumsily flies into a challenge in the middle of the pitch and leaves the referee with no choice but to show him a second yellow card. The Brazilian looks flabbergasted at the decision, but he really can't have any complaints."
90'+1',substitution,"; Inter have made a late change, with Candreva making way for Gabriel, who comes on to make a rare appearance for the Nerazzurri."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be four minutes of added time.
89',action,"Another fantastic save by Consigli! Perisic goes one-on-one with the Sassuolo goalkeeper after skipping through the middle of the hosts' back line once again, but this time the shot-stopper gets down well to his right to save the midfielder's low strike. He really should have buried that!"
88',action,"Great goalkeeping by Consigli! A lovely pass is slotted into the left-hand side of the Sassuolo box and towards Perisic, who had made a good run forward, but Consigli reads the danger extremely well and darts out swiftly to deal with the Croatian."
87',action,"Ragusa causes problems on the left wing again before cutting inside and teeing up Iemmello, but the striker's low shot from the edge of the box doesn't have enough power behind it to cause problems for Handanovic."
86',action,"Brozovic almost makes it 2-0! The Croatian charges through the middle of the pitch on a great run and unleashes a low strike from the edge of the Sassuolo penalty area, but he scuffs his shot ever so slightly to send it a few yards wide of the far post and out for a goal-kick."
84',action,"Almost an own-goal by Miranda! Ragusa skips past D'Ambrosio far too easily before fizzing a dangerous pass across the face of goal, but Miranda is just about able to get on the ball before firing a scuffed clearance just wide of the far post. That could have gone anywhere!"
82',action,"What a miss by Matri! Defrel, who has arguably been one of Sassuolo's best players today, weaves through the middle of the pitch before slotting a clever pass into the feet of Matri, but the striker snatches at his first-time effort and comically sends the ball spinning well wide of the goal."
80',action,"Perisic gets himself into a great position just outside of the Sassuolo box on the left wing after skipping past his marker, but his cross into the penalty area is poor and sails several yards over the head of Icardi."
79',action,"D'Ambrosio latches on to a loose ball on the halfway line and quickly tries to tee up Icardi with a chipped pass over the top of the Sassuolo defence, but the striker's run forward is slightly mistimed and he's flagged offside as a result."
77',substitution,"; Sassuolo have made their third and final change of the afternoon, with Mazzitelli making way for Pietro Iemmello."
76',action,"Ansaldi gets himself into a good position deep down the left wing and tries to pick out Icardi with a bouncing cross into the middle of the box, but the striker decides to leave the ball for a teammate that doesn't exist and Inter are unable to carve out another chance on goal."
75',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Felipe Melo de Carvalho ; Melo loses the ball after doing well to muscle his way towards the edge of the Sassuolo penalty area, and he then becomes the latest Inter player to receive a booking after clattering into Missiroli after the midfielder had cleared the ball away from danger."
73',action,"Sassuolo lose out deep inside the Inter half of the pitch and allow the visitors to counter quickly. Banega initially does well to get forward but is dispossessed far too easily after getting himself into a good position, and Ansaldi then plays a clumsy pass out of play for a throw-in."
72',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Marcelo Brozović ; Brozovic clumsy trips Defrel to the ground as the Frenchman tries to break away on a quick counter-attack, and he becomes the latest player to enter the referee's book."
71',action,"Banega immediately gets involved in the thick of the action before teeing up Perisic deep down the left wing, but the latter is unable to pick out Icardi with a low cross and has to settle for a corner. The set-piece is taken quickly and sent out to Brozovic, who then unleashes a curling cross-cum-shot that sails just a few yards over the top of the crossbar."
69',substitution,"; Inter have made their first alteration of the game, with Mario making way for Ever Banega."
68',yellow-card,"Yellow Card João Mário Naval da Costa Eduardo ; Sassuolo keep coming back at Inter, but they lose out deep down the left wing and the visitors are able to fly forward on a swift counter-attack. Mario initially does well to get forward before running into traffic, and he then commits a poor foul as he stretches for the ball and picks up a yellow card that means he'll miss the game against Lazio on Wednesday."
66',action,"Lirola gets himself into a good position just outside of the Inter penalty area before playing a quick one-two with Missiroli. He then tries to test Handanovic with a shot from 20 yards out, but his effort is completely overhit and sails well over the top of the crossbar."
64',action,"Great chance for Sensi! The midfielder flies into the left-hand side of the Inter box and latches on to a clever cross before testing Handanovic with a low half-volley, but the goalkeeper quickly closes his legs to stop the effort from finding the back of the net."
62',action,"The resulting free-kick is eventually taken and swung over to the far post, but it's slightly overhit and sails comfortably past the outstretched foot of D'Ambrosio and out of play for a Sassuolo goal-kick."
61',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Simone Missiroli ; Missiroli makes an immediate impact after coming on to the pitch, but it's not necessarily the one he would have wanted as he flies into Mario and brings the Portuguese crashing to the ground to earn himself the first yellow card of the game."
60',substitution,"; And the second is Alessandro Matri, who replaces Ricci."
60',substitution,"; Sassuolo have decided to make a double substitution as they try to find a way back into the game. The first player to come on is Simone Missiroli, who takes the place of Pellegrini."
59',action,"Sensi is dispossessed by Icardi in a dangerous position as the two battle for the ball in the middle of the pitch, and the referee decides that the tackle wasn't a fair one and awards a free-kick to Sassuolo just as Icardi is about to break away."
57',action,"Ouch! Pellegrini cuts inside from the left wing and skips towards the Inter penalty area before trying to take on D'Ambrosio, but he's dispossessed by a crunching tackle from the defender and is left in a heap on the floor. The challenge was a fair one, but Inter nonetheless decide to send the ball out of play."
55',action,"Melo muscles his way through the middle of the pitch and easily skips away from two Sassuolo players. He then quickly tees up Perisic, who is in a good position on the edge of the box, but the Croatian is far too slow in possession and is unable to get a decent shot away as a result."
53',action,"Miranda charges down the left flank as he tries to carve out another chance on goal for Inter, but he's unable to find a way past Antei and ends up firing a low cross off the defender and away from danger. The Brazilian immediately screams for a penalty after claiming that the ball had hit the defender's hand, but the referee isn't at all interested and waves play on."
51',action,"Candreva gets himself into a good position deep down the right wing and quickly swings a low cross into the middle of the Sassuolo penalty area, but it's slightly underhit and is easily thumped away from danger by Acerbi before it can find Icardi."
49',action,"Sassuolo quickly push forward from the restart and do well to win themselves a corner. It's whipped into a dangerous position inside the penalty area and causes problems for the Inter back line, but Jeison Murillo is just about able to clear the danger with a header that flies a few yards over the top of his own crossbar."
47',assist,"Assist Mauro Emanuel Icardi Rivero ; Icardi managed to get an important touch on the ball to knock it back to Candreva in the build-up to the goal, and questions will certainly be asked of the Sassuolo defence as they were far too slow to react to the danger."
47',goal,"Goal Antonio Candreva ; GOAL! Inter have taken the lead! A mistake by Dell'Orco allows Mario to dart into the left-hand side of the Sassuolo box and unleash a thumping low shot. Consigli gets down well but can only push the ball out to Candreva, who then thumps it into the top right-hand corner of the net to make it 1-0 to the Nerazzurri."
46',action,And we're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"It's been a frustrating opening 45 minutes for Inter, who have arguably been the better of the two sides but have been unable to break down a resolute and determined Sassuolo back line. The hosts have largely performed well, with Antei and Acerbi forming a particularly strong partnership in the centre of defence. At the other end, they've looked dangerous on the break, with Inter sometimes being caught out when pushing plenty of bodies forward."
,action,HALF-TIME: SASSUOLO 0-0 INTER
45',action,"Candreva and Cristian Dell'Orco battle for the ball deep down the right wing before the latter cynically stops the ball from rolling out of play by using his hands, resulting in a free-kick for Inter in a very dangerous position. Mario steps up and sends a low pass towards Brozovic on the edge of the penalty area, but the Croatian's shot is poor and fails to find its way through the sea of Sassuolo players camped in front of him."
43',action,"After spending the last 10 minutes or so on the back foot, Sassuolo try to push forward on an attack down the right wing. Lirola gets forward well before attempting to tee up Mazzitelli, but the midfielder fails to read the flight of the ball and loses out just outside of the penalty area."
41',action,"Perisic receives the ball on the left-hand side of the Sassuolo penalty area but is far too slow in possession. He's eventually able to tee up Brozovic after being put under pressure, but the latter's rushed strike is deflected comfortably wide of the goal and out for a corner that fails to result in a chance on goal."
39',action,"Candreva, who has arguably been Inter's best player thus far, skips into the box and takes on Acerbi before settling for a corner. The set-piece is whipped towards the near post and finds Icardi in a good position in front of goal, but the striker is unable to find the back of the net and instead sends his header out for a goal-kick."
38',action,"Ansaldi and Brozovic link up over on the left flank before the latter pokes a pass towards Candreva, but, again, the winger is unable to test Consigli and instead sends his first-time strike comfortably wide of the near post."
36',action,"Vital block by Francesco Acerbi! Inter come back once again, and this time it's Candreva who is presented with a chance to shoot. He's in a great position in front of goal and unleashes a thumping strike towards the right-hand side of the net, but Acerbi is there to throw his body in the way of the shot."
35',action,"Perisic almost makes it 1-0! Candreva sprints down the right wing on a great run and skips past his marker with ease before teeing up Perisic, but the Croatian's first-time shot is pushed away by Consigli before Icardi fires his follow-up effort well wide of the goal."
34',action,"And now Defrel goes close! A beautiful lofted pass is sent forward by Sensi and finds Defrel in a pocket of space inside the penalty area, but his first-time volleyed effort is just about cut out by a fingertip save from Handanovic. Sassuolo are starting to look dangerous whenever they push forward."
33',action,"Chance for Sensi! A huge gap opens up in the heart of the pitch and allows Sensi to fly forward completely unopposed, but he decides to shoot instead of teeing up Ragusa and his strike is deflected out of play. It definitely came off an Inter player, but the referee doesn't think so and awards a goal-kick to the visitors."
32',action,"Sassuolo lose out in the middle of the pitch, allowing Icardi to break into the right-hand side of the hosts' penalty area. He momentarily holds the ball up before trying to find D'Ambrosio at the far post, but his cross is poor and fails to pick out the defender."
30',action,"Ansaldi falls asleep on the ball near to the halfway line and is quickly dispossessed by Luca Mazzitelli, who then breaks forward swiftly. He charges down the right wing and tries to get himself into a position to cross, but Brozovic is there to win the ball back for Inter with a firm but fair sliding tackle."
28',action,"Icardi goes close! Candreva twists and turns over on the right flank before curling a beautiful cross right on to the head of Icardi, but the captain's headed effort ends up flying agonisingly wide of the far post after leaving Consigli rooted to the spot."
27',action,"Once again, Inter are caught with plenty of bodies up the pitch and allow Sassuolo the chance to hit them on a counter-attack. Ragusa is the main architect of the move and this time picks out Pellegrini, but the midfielder's shot is closed down well by Joao Miranda and is deflected into the hands of Handanovic."
26',action,"A half-hearted Inter attack comes to an end and Sassuolo counter quickly down the left flank. Ragusa sprints down the wing and cuts towards the penalty area before setting up Ricci with a smart cross, but the latter's first-time shot from close range ends up sailing comfortably over the top of the crossbar."
25',action,"D'Ambrosio darts down the right wing once again before sending another cross into the Sassuolo penalty area, but the home side have plenty of bodies back to deal with the danger."
23',action,"D'Ambrosio gets himself into a good position on the right-hand side of the Sassuolo penalty area and fires a low cross into the box that Luca Antei is just about able to poke out for a corner. The resulting set-piece almost finds D'Ambrosio at the near post, but, despite his best efforts, the Inter defender is unable to reach the ball with his head."
21',action,"Ansaldi spots a run forward from Mauro Icardi and quickly tries to pick out the striker with a lofted pass towards the edge of the penalty area, but the captain's run is slightly mistimed and the linesman's flag is raised as soon as he touches the ball."
20',action,"Stefano Sensi picks up the ball in a good position in the middle of the pitch and quickly tries to pick out Defrel with a chipped pass into the Inter box, but it's slightly overhit and sails over the striker's head before landing in the hands of Samir Handanovic."
19',action,"Sassuolo are caught light at the back, allowing Inter to hit them on a counter-attack of their own. Perisic charges down the right wing and links up well with Mario, but the Portuguese is unable to swing a cross into the penalty area and the attacking move fails to result in a chance on goal."
17',action,"Fantastic opportunity for Sassuolo! Melo loses the ball in the middle of the pitch and allows Defrel to break forward on a quick counter-attack. The Frenchman sprints down the left wing and cuts into the box before trying to tee up Ricci, but his fizzed pass across the face of goal is poor and sails to find the forward."
16',action,Candreva hits the post! Lorenzo Pellegrini is caught out of position over on the left of the Sassuolo midfield and allows Candreva to pick up the ball in acres of space. He breaks forward quickly and then unleashes a rocket of a shot that deflects off a defender and on to the woodwork after leaving Consigli rooted to the spot.
14',action,"Mario swings in a dangerous cross from the set-piece that flies just over the head of Felipe Melo before bouncing out to Marcelo Brozovic on the edge of the box, but the Croatian is unable to control the ball before having it poked away from his feet."
13',action,"Inter quickly come back and continue putting pressure on the Sassuolo back line, but each of the three crosses chipped into the heart of the penalty area are just about dealt with by Consigli before the visitors win themselves another corner."
12',action,"Fantastic strike by Antonio Candreva! Joao Mario is fouled midway down the left wing, resulting in a free-kick for Inter. The set-piece initially fails to result in a chance on goal but falls to Candreva, who then unleashes a rocket of a shot that Andrea Consigli does well to parry away with a smart diving save."
11',action,"Great chance for Ragusa! Pol Lirola picks up the ball in a pocket of space over on the right wing before swinging a dangerous cross into the Inter box. It flies over the visitors' defence before finding Ragusa, but the flight of the ball seems to take him by surprise and he's unable to control it in front of goal."
9',action,"A lofted pass down the right wing finds Federico Ricci, who then quickly wins a corner for the home side. It's curled towards the near post and causes plenty of problems for the Inter defence, but Perisic is just about able to pounce on the ball before a Sassuolo player can get a shot away from close range."
7',action,"Sassuolo put good pressure on the Inter midfield to win the ball back before flying forward on a quick counter-attack. Antonio Ragusa cuts inside from the left wing and tries to play a quick one-two with Gregoire Defrel on the edge of the penalty area, but Danilo D'Ambrosio is there to cut out the danger."
5',action,"Perisic darts down the left flank once again as he does well to latch on to a lofted pass forward from Cristian Ansaldi. He gets himself into a good position near to the byline before sending another cross into the penalty area, but this time it sails out of play for a goal-kick."
3',action,"Inter patiently move the ball around deep inside the Sassuolo half of the pitch before Ivan Perisic swings a low cross into the middle of the box, but it's poorly hit and fails to find a white shirt in front of goal."
1',action,"And we're off! Inter get us underway, attacking from right to left."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."
,action,"Meanwhile, Inter boss Stefano Pioli has made three alterations to the team that featured in their last outing, with Yuto Nagatomo, Eder and Rodrigo Palacio making way for Felipe Melo, Cristian Ansaldi and Ivan Perisic."
,action,"Eusebio Di Francesco has decided to make four changes to the Sassuolo side that started the defeat against Fiorentina, with Pol Lirola, Luca Antei, Cristian Dell’Orco and Luca Mazzitelli coming into the starting line-up to replace Marcello Gazzola, Paolo Cannavaro, Federico Peluso and Francesco Magnanelli, respectively."

,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this morning…"
,action,"Luckily for today’s hosts, Inter haven’t been in great form either, despite looking slightly better under the watchful eye of Stefano Pioli. Last weekend saw them beat Genoa 2-0 at home to move up to ninth place in the table, and the 3-4-3 adopted by their new manager seemed to do the trick. It looks as if he will continue with that formation today as he aims to guide his team to a much-needed victory."
,action,"After managing to go unbeaten in two consecutive games for only the second time this season, last weekend saw Sassuolo lose 2-1 away to Fiorentina to suffer their ninth loss of the campaign. Five of those have come in their last seven games, leaving an injury-stricken side in desperate need of a positive result here today."
,action,"Sassuolo thoroughly impressed last season and deservedly finished in an excellent sixth place, qualifying them for the Europa League in the process, but things haven’t been quite as rosy for the Neroverdi this year. They currently sit in a disappointing 15th place with just 17 points from 16 games, with their leaky defence largely the cause of their current problems."
,action,"Inter have had to endure some miserable moments at the Mapei in recent years, with clashing with ultras and red card-induced capitulations blighting some of their recent visits to Modena. They did leave here with a 7-0 victory little over two years ago, but since then Sassuolo have won in each of the three meetings between the two sides."
,action,Good morning and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Serie A game between Sassuolo and Inter at the Mapei Stadium.
