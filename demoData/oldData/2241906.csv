,action,"FULL-TIME! Southampton grind out a 1-0 win over Boro at St. Mary's, courtesy of a bit of magic from Boufal. Boro were combative and kept chances to a minimum, with both goalkeepers having little to do throughout the 90 minutes, but the Saints just about come out on top. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+2',action,"Over the crossbar from Rodriguez! What a miss! Redmond breaks down the left-hand side and gets to the byline, before drilling a low cross into the six-yard box. The ex-Burnley striker slides in but can't make telling contact, sending the ball whistling over the target from about three yards out."
90',action,There are three minutes of stoppage time.
89',action,"Fonte lifts a great pass in behind for Long to chase, which the Irishman gets out. He drives to the right byline and clips a cross in towards the back post, but Rodriguez can't manage to turn it goalwards! Boro respond with their own attack, but Redmond robs Adama Traore of possession easily."
87',action,"Southampton win themselves a corner on the right-hand side of the attack, with Ward-Prowse able to bend in a cross from out wide. He puts in a poor delivery, and then follows it up by getting hold of the rebound and firing that over the crossbar too. He has had a bit of an off-day!"
85',substitution,"; Clasie is replaced for the late stages for Southampton, with Long coming into the game. Boro will need to be very wary of his pace on the counter-attack. Meanwhile, on the pitch, Fabio gives away a throw-in after failing to take it from where the referee told him to stand."
83',action,"OFF THE LINE! Southampton win themselves a corner, which shouldn't have been given their way at all. Rodriguez gets up well and powers Ward-Prowse's delivery goalwards, but Clayton stoops to head a good clearance away from the danger zone. That man on the near post does his job well!"
81',substitution,"; Stuani is replaced by Adama Traore for the late stages, as Karanka uses his wildcard from the bench."
80',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Adam Clayton ; Clayton gets a booking for diving into a cynical tackle on Clasie, after losing possession in the midfield third."
79',action,"Forshaw drives forward and beats a couple of players, before combining with Fabio. Fischer is then fed possession, and play is whipped out to the right-hand side, but Clayton gifts the ball away to Clasie in a dangerous area. They can't seem to break Southampton's lines."
77',action,"Southampton are happy to slow things down with a slow spell of possession, before Ward-Prowse gets released down the right. The English midfielder tries to whip in a cross, but Chambers clears. This game has seen a lot of percentage football played from the wide areas."
75',action,"Over from Davis! Martina bends in a good cross from the right-hand side, but the full-back's delivery is headed above the crossbar by the Southampton substitute. His introduction has inspired a slight change of shape for the Saints, who are keen to earn themselves a much-needed three points today."
74',action,"Redmond tries to beat Gibson down the right-hand side, but the English defender puts in a good block to deny a cross from the former Norwich winger. Boro are committing players forward to try and find an equaliser, but it is leaving their central defenders a bit more exposed a at the back as a result."
73',substitution,"; Boufal is replaced by the more industrious option of Davis, as Puel tries to see out a good result."
72',action,"Martina scampers down the line, but then gives away possession to De Roon. Boro play their way out of trouble, with Fischer and Fabio combining down the left, before a long-range strike from Stuani is blocked by Van Dijk. The rebound falls to Barragan, who tries to fire in a powerful cross from the right byline, but the ex-Valencia man can only find Forster's gloves."
70',action,"Forshaw curls a lofted delivery into the box, but Fabio is beaten to a header, with Boro's points of attack still not getting any joy. Fonte lifts a pass down the right-hand side to Martina, who picks out Boufal at the back post, but the goalscorer is penalised for grabbing hold of Stuani. There wasn't much in that, really."
68',action,"Rodriguez almost manages to pinch the ball from Valdes' feet, but the Spaniard keeps his cool to slot a pass out to Fabio. That was a nervy moment for Boro! The visitors respond by trying to mount an offensive, but Rhodes is fouled by Fonte, before a curling cross from Barragan sees Martina deny Fischer a chance to shoot brilliantly."
66',action,"Barragan tries to whip in a cross from the right-hand side, but Van Dijk makes a block, before a curling delivery from Stuani evades everyone and fizzes beyond the back post. Rhodes and Fischer really should have gambled on that ball in, as it was angled perfectly for his teammates to attack without Forster being confident of coming out to claim."
64',action,"Van Dijk has got the measure of Rhodes, with the ex-Blackburn Rovers forward unable to win anything over the towering Dutchman. Boro are very much looking to get their striker into the game, but the absence of Negredo is proving damaging. The ex-Sevilla man would hold his own against a physical central defensive pairing."
62',action,"Fabio is found on the left-hand side, but can't deliver a cross, with Boro forced to open the ball out to the opposite flank instead. The away side have to remain patient, as they can't seem to find their way through Southampton's organised lines. Half an hour remains for Karanka to mastermind a comeback."
60',action,"Boro whip a free-kick in from the right-hand side, but Forster claims easily. Karanka's men are committing a few players forward in search of an equaliser, but Southampton are standing up to the rest so far. Moments later, Barragan bends in a delivery from out wide, but Van Dijk hooks clear."
58',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Oriol Romeu Vidal ; Rhodes is the target of a long ball in behind by Stuani, but Van Dijk has the pace to get there ahead of the ex-Blackburn striker. Boro maintain their pressure, before Romeu dives into a really poor tackle on Forshaw. That gets him a yellow card too."
57',action,"Boro try to get onto the front foot and ask a few questions of the hosts, but Fonte and Van Dijk have had the measure of Rhodes so far. Forshaw whips in a cross from the right-hand side, but Forster is off his line quickly to punch clear effectively. This contest is opening up a little, after a cagey first 45 minutes."
55',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Jos√© Miguel da Rocha Fonte ; Fonte picks up a yellow card for a late tackle on Stuani, slides through the ex-Espanyol man after the ball was long gone. There can be no complaints with that one."
55',action,"After a terrible first half, this game has already burst into life after the break. Boufal's magical strike has roused the St. Mary's crowd, and Boro now have no option but to try and get forward themselves in response. Martina tries to find Redmond at the back post, but the former Birmingham man loses out in the air."
53',assist,"Assist James Ward-Prowse ; Ward-Prowse slides a low pass into his team-mate, but it is Boufal that applies the classy finish!"
53',goal,"Goal Sofiane Boufal ; GOOOOOOOOAL! BOUFAL MAKES IT 1-0! The Moroccan nets his first Premier League goal, and that's quite an effort! He unleashes a left-footed effort from 25 yards out that swerves into the top-left corner, with Valdes left rooted to the spot. He got some real power behind that one!"
52',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Adam Forshaw ; The refere gives the first yellow card of the second half to Forshaw, as the Boro midfielder gets the wrong side of Boufal and then hauls his man back."
51',action,"Rodriguez is the target of a long, clipped pass upfield, but Chambers is able to nod a cushioned header back to Valdes. Boro respond with a long-range effort from Rhodes, but the former Huddersfield man blasts the ball a long way over the crossbar. That's a disappointing strike from the Scotland international."
50',action,"Redmond finds Boufal overlapping down the left-hand side, before a cut-back from the byline picks out Rodriguez. The ex-Burnley striker tries to shoot from close-range, but is denied by Gibson, as Southampton continue to attack with a real swagger in the opening minutes of this second half."
48',action,"Redmond sees a shot charged down on the edge of the box, before a whipped cross from the right by Martina is missed by Ward-Prowse! The Englishman tries a cheeky backheel finish, but doesn't make telling contact. Moments later, Redmond is bound at the back post and knocks a pass down to Boufal, but the Moroccan midfielder sees a close-range effort blocked."
46',substitution,"; Tadic is replaced by Redmond for the second half, with the ex-Norwich man offering a bit more pace and a direct approach down the left."
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half! Puel will be hoping for a reaction from his players, after what was a fairly disappointing first 45 minutes from the home side."
,action,"HALF-TIME! The two sides go in goalless at the break, with boos ringing around the stadium. Clear-cut chances have been at a premium, with entertainment lacking, and Puel will have a lot to say at the break after a disappointing and toothless half from his Saints."
45'+1',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Sofiane Boufal ; Boufal picks up a yellow card for kicking the ball away, after giving away a foul for a tackle on Barragan. That's the frustration showing from the Moroccan."
44',action,"Boro win themselves another free-kick in a dangerous area, with Fischer playing short to Clayton. A pass is then fed to De Roon, who tries to whip a cross into the penalty area, but his delivery sails straight out. That one definitely wasn't straight off the training ground. Karanka looks a bit flummoxed on the touchline after that."
42',action,"De Roon is fouled by Tadic on the left-hand side, but a free-kick delivery is half-cleared. A second cross is lumped back into the box from the right, this time finding De Roon, but the midfielder sees a shot blocked. Moments later, Rhodes is penalised for dangerous play, after catching Fonte with a boot to the head. Only a few minutes remain until the break."
40',action,"Barragan makes his way down the right and clips a cross towards the back post, but Martina rises highest to nod clear. Moments later, Fabio threatens down the opposite flank, but can only win his side a throw-in. Boro are not afraid to commit players forward, and this game is very precariously poised indeed."
38',action,"Boufal tries to slip a neat throughball in behind for Rodriguez, but Chambers reads it well to clear. Moments later, Clasie is found in space inside the box, but the Dutchman sees a powerful effort charged down well. Southampton then look for the ex-Burnley striker with a direct, lofted ball, but Valdes is happy to let it run out for a goal-kick."
36',action,"OFF THE POST! Fischer is released in behind by a poor backpass, but the ex-Ajax man is forced wide by Van Dijk. He dances beyond Forster and thuds a shot from a tight angle onto the woodwork, with the rebound struck into a ruck of bodies by Stuani. The ex-Espanyol man picks up the second ball, but his second attempt is deflected over the target. That was a huge chance for Boro."
33',action,"De Roon tries to find Barragan overlapping, but he sells his right-back short and McQueen intercepts. The Southampton full-back bolts upfield and is denied by a clearance from Clayton, but a quick throw-in from Tadic allows for the hosts to whip a quick cross into the box. Ward-Prowse is the man to get on the end of it, but his flicked header sails wide."
32',action,"Clayton finds Fabio on the left-hand side, but the Brazilian is robbed of possession while trying to cut infield and onto his favoured foot. Moments later, the ex-Manchester United gets a final warning for fouling Clasie in the midfield third, as he has been rather rash throughout the first 30 minutes at St. Mary's."
30',action,"Forshaw wins a corner from Fonte down the left-hand side, which is Boro's first of the afternoon. Fischer bends it in, but the delivery is lashed away by Ward-Prowse at the near post. Moments later, Stuani tries to find the Dane making a run in behind, but the ex-Ajax man is penalised for tugging on Martina's shirt in a bid to earn an extra yard on his opponent."
28',action,"Southampton continue to show patience with their use of the ball, but McQueen is failing to offer any kind of quality on the overlap. This time, the Englishman can't keep possession in play. Boro respond with a break, as Fischer bends in a cross from the left, but Van Dijk is present the volley the danger away from within his own box."
26',action,"The home side work the ball from right to left, with McQueen a continued outlet on the left-hand side. Stuani continues to not get close enough to his man, but the Englishman swings an awful delivery straight out for a goal-kick on the far side. Southampton have seen more of the ball, but Valdes remains untroubled. Boufal is showing some flashes of magic, but a few stepovers have been his limit thus far."
24',action,"Martina breaks down the right-hand side and cuts in a pass, but Boro half-clear their lines. McQueen breaks down the left moments later, but Stuani get back and slides in to deny the inexperienced full-back. He is afforded the chance to deliver again with his wrong foot, but bends the cross out of play at the back post."
22',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Du≈°an Tadiƒá ; Tadic is cautioned for tugging back on Fabio, as the Brazilian full-back looks to start a break from his own half."
20',action,"Tadic wriggles to the right byline and manages to get beyond McQueen, but can only win a corner. The Serbia international bends a delivery in, which is cleared at the first attempt, but the Saints maintain their pressure. Clasie curls a low cross in from the right, but Rodriguez can only sweep a low effort straight at Valdes."
18',action,"Wide from Clasie! The Netherlands international is picked out on the edge of the penalty area by a good cut-back from Macqueen, but he guides a sweeping shot just beyond the back post. Two half-chances have fallen to the Dutchman in good areas."
17',yellow-card,Yellow Card Antonio Barrag√°n Fern√°ndez ; Stuani picks up a yellow card for clipping the heels of McQueen as the young left-back tried to bend in a cross from the left.
16',action,"The game has broken down regularly so far, with a few fouls interrupting the flow of the action. Karanka won't mind too much, but the referee might have to be liberal with his cards to prevent this game getting out of hand. Rhodes is sitting on the last man and preying on any potential errors from the hosts, but the Scotland international has had no such luck so far."
14',action,"Boufal should have been awarded a free-kick on the edge of the Southampton box, as Clayton raises an arm to the Moroccan's face accidentally, but the referee doesn't see anything wrong. Moments later, Tadic goes down after a painful one from Fabio, but the Brazilian escapes an early booking."
12',action,"Clasie takes aim from around 20 yards out, after linking up well with Rodriguez, but the Dutchman then blazes a powerful shot a long way wide of the near post. Valdes had his angles covered easily there. Both sides are struggling to carve out telling opportunities, with Rodriguez in particular struggling to find the space required up top to enjoy himself."
11',action,"Both Clayton and Forshaw are happy to sit a little deeper today, allowing for Fabio and Barragan to push high upfield to offer width on the attack. Tadic clips a long pass over to McQueen on the left-hand side, but the ex-Valencia right-back tracks back to slot a clearance into touch. Boufal then goes down on the edge of the box, as the Spaniard tackles his man roughly, but it is a fair challenge."
9',action,"Martina is released down the right-hand side, but is denied the chance to cross, with Southampton enjoying a long spell of settled possession. The hosts are calm, with the likes of De Roon, Forshaw and Clayton keen to buzz around and press intensely in the right areas."
7',action,"Fischer makes a good intervention in midfield, with the Dane clipping a cross in towards Stuani at the back post, but the Uruguayan striker is outmuscled by Fonte. Boro are already looking fairly dangerous on the break, and the Saints can't afford to give the ball away so cheaply in the midfield third."
5',action,"Southampton win a free-kick on the right-hand side, and it is whipped in towards the back post, but Boro manage to clear their lines well through Stuani. The home side settle down and enjoy a spell of possession, with Karanka's men choosing to sit deep and play on the counter-attack as they like to."
3',action,"Important save from Forster! The ex-Celtic goalkeeper makes a great save at his near post, after narrowing the angle well. Rhodes was the man denied from close-range, after Fischer did well to break beyond Martina and get to the left byline."
