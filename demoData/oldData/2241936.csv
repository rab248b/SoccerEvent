,action,"FULL-TIME! Southampton crash to a 4-1 defeat against Spurs, with a red card for Redmond defining the game. Alli scored twice for the away side, with Kane and Son grabbing the others - with Kane also missing a penalty. Van Dijk opened the scoring, but the Saints then sank to a terrible loss, which puts Pochettino's men right back in the race for fourth place. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+2',action,"Long is the target of a long ball in behind from Southampton, and appeared to be shoved by Vertonghen, allowing for Lloris to mop up the loose ball. The referee isn't interested in giving a foul, however, and waves for the French goalkeeper to continue."
90'+1',action,There are three minutes of stoppage time at St. Mary's.
90',yellow-card,Yellow Card Jan Vertonghen ; Vertonghen gets a late booking for reacting angrily to Long's tackle.
90',yellow-card,Yellow Card Shane Long ; Long gets a yellow card for his part in tangling with Vertonghen.
89',substitution,"; Kane is replaced for the last few minutes, with Janssen given the chance to return from injury with a brief cameo."
87',assist,"Assist Danny Rose ; Rose does excellently, dancing infield from out wide, before stabbing a low pass through the lines and into Alli's feet."
87',goal,"Goal Bamidele Alli ; GOOOOOOOAL! IT'S FOUR! Alli manages to stab a neat pass forward into Son, who appears to be fouled on the edge of the Southampton box, but the referee isn't interested. Moments later, Rose sparks a break down the left and cuts infield, before finding Alli in the area. The English midfielder takes a touch and curls a low finish home."
85',goal,"Goal Heung-Min Son ; GOOOOOOOAL! SON WRAPS IT UP! Eriksen tries to lift a throughball into the path of the substitute, which takes an important touch off Romeu on the way forward. The South Korea international races into the penalty area and slots a fantastic finish into the bottom-right corner."
84',action,"Spurs are happy to retain possession and stroke the ball around in their own half, with Southampton needing to press and show some late urgency. Hojbjerg tries to carry the ball forward, but the substitute is quickly robbed of the ball and the visitor are on the charge!"
82',substitution,"; Dembele takes his leave for the dying minutes at St. Mary's, with Winks given the chance to prove himself as Spurs try and close this one out. With the Belgian having a booking to his name, Pochettino isn't willing to risk a second."
80',action,"Lloris gives the ball away to Hojbjerg and slips to the ground, with the Danish substitute unable to lift a finish into an open goal while the Frenchman is on the turf! That was a huge let-off for the away side."
78',action,"Narrowly over 10 minutes remain in the second half, with Southampton on the prowl for a goal. Romeu wins the ball high upfield, before feeding a low pass into Tadic, but Dembele robs the Serbia international of possession easily. The hosts have been too light-weight in the final third."
76',action,"Eriksen wins a corner on the right-hand side, after his shot from long-range was deflected shy of the right-hand post. The away side take it short, with the Dane eventually whipping in a cross from the same flank. It is cleared quite easily. Southampton need to break out of their own half."
74',substitution,"; Sissoko takes his leave for the final quarter of an hour, with Son introduced to add some fresh legs to Spurs' attack."
74',action,"Wide from Rose! The England international gets into the penalty area, after being picked out getting in behind by a neat flick from Eriksen. The former Sunderland man tries to shoot from a tight angle, but loses his footing and slices a shot wide of the near upright."
72',substitution,"; Rodriguez is withdrawn after chasing lost causes all evening, with Long given the last 20 minutes to find himself a goal."
72',substitution,"; Boufal jogs off after a quiet second half, with Tadic introduced on the left-hand side for the Saints."
72',substitution,"; Davis takes his leave, with Hojbjerg freshening up the midfield third for the home side."
71',action,"OFF THE BAR! Sissoko and Rose combine down the left-hand side, with the latter able to cut a cross back to Eriksen from the byline. The Danish midfielder gets the ball out of his feet, before blasting a ferocious effort onto the woodwork. Forster wouldn't have got anywhere near it!"
70',action,"Cedric bends in a wonderful cross from wide on the right-hand side, but Lloris is alert to the danger and makes a fantastic claim. Moments later, Southampton threaten through Romeu, who slots a pass infield to Davis, but the hosts' midfielder is flattened by a great tackle from Rose."
68',action,"Good effort from Wanyama! The ex-Saints midfielder takes aim from range, after wrongfooting Davis, but the Southampton goalkeeper pushes the shot over his crossbar with a firm hand. The resulting corner finds its way to Walker on the edge of the box, who shoots, but Bertrand makes a great block."
66',action,"Rose is found making tracks down the left-hand side, but a low cross from the Englishman is cut out by Cedric. Neither goalkeeper has had a great deal to do, with Lloris enjoying a relative holiday in the second half. The final ball into the box has been awful on both sides of the fence."
64',action,"Kane is fed into the penalty area, but Van Dijk covers across brilliantly to deny the Spurs striker. Moments later, Alli scoops a ball over the top for Sissoko, but the French wide man's square ball towards Kane is cleared. Pochettino's men are struggling to kill this contest off."
62',action,"Cedric sees a long-range effort deflected wide of the target, before some maintained pressure from the hosts results in a cross being gobbled up by Forster. Spurs are happy to retain possession and enjoy a calming spell on the ball, as this second half has been rather inflammatory so far."
60',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Danny Rose ; Tempers are rising a little bit at St. Mary's, with Rose getting a yellow card for cynically blocking off Cedric. The home fans are getting on the referee's back, especially since Redmond's dismissal."
58',missed-penalty,"Missed Penalty Harry Kane ; OVER THE CROSSBAR FROM KANE! Awful penalty attempt from the Englishman. He blasts a terrible shot over the target, after the turf moved beneath his standing leg! The pitch is to blame, there."
57',red-card,"Red Card Nathan Redmond ; RED CARD! Redmond is sent off for denying a goalscoring opportunity, and seemingly due to the referee believing that he wasn't making a genuine attempt to play the ball."
56',action,"PENALTY TO SPURS! Alli scampers into the penalty area and shoots wide of the target under pressure, but the referee pulls play back for a tug from Redmond."
55',yellow-card,Yellow Card Kyle Walker ; Walker gets a yellow card after diving into a tackle dangerously on Bertrand. The Englishman will miss his next game due to suspension as a result.
54',action,"Southampton earn themselves a free-kick on the right, which is curled in by Fonte. The Portuguese centre-back meets the ball with his head, but can only lift a looping header well over the crossbar. That was an awful effort. Spurs' travelling support is making all of the noise now!"
52',assist,"Assist Christian Dannemann Eriksen ; Eriksen opts to whip in a cross, rather than go short, earning himself another assist for the season."
52',goal,"Goal Harry Kane ; GOOOOOOOAL! SPURS TURN IT AROUND! Dier tries to clip a long pass into the path of the overlapping Walker, forcing Bertrand to concede a corner on the left-hand side. Eriksen bends the delivery in, which Kane meets! The England international plants a firm header inside the near post and Spurs have the lead. Forster had no chance."
50',action,"Play has been reserved to the midfield third at the moment, with both teams moving the ball at quite a slow pace. As a result, it has been made much easier for Southampton to keep their shape. Sissoko tries to lift a cross in from the left, but his delivery sails straight behind for a goal-kick."
48',action,"The second half has started very nervily, with Spurs enjoying patient, slow possession. Dier tries to lift a long pass forward that searches for the run of Kane in behind, but the ball is far too heavy. Forster is off his line in a flash to gather it up, in acres of space."
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half! Spurs may have had more of the ball, but chances have been scarce so far on the south coast of England. A huge 45 minutes remains for the away side, who need to win to keep the pressure on Arsenal."
,action,"HALF-TIME! The two sides go in level at the break, courtesy of goals from Van Dijk and Alli. Both have been headers, and there hasn't been much else to shout about at St. Mary's. The away side have enjoyed more of the ball, but chances have been few and far between, with Kane struggling to get himself involved up top."
45',action,There is one minute of first-half stoppage time.
43',action,"Chance for Wanyama! The ex-Saints midfielder bundles his way into the box, after being found on the edge of the box by Sissoko. He dances past two players, before getting into a shooting position - but Fonte and Forster slide in to deny the Kenya international. Almost a breakthrough!"
41',action,"Southampton are waiting for Spurs to play into certain areas, before descending onto the ball in numbers, but their quick-fire counter-attacks aren't generating any opportunities. Both lone strikers at St. Mary's have had very little to feed off. Rose bends a cross in from the left, but Davis takes the delivery down easily on the edge of his own area."
39',action,"Dembele escapes down the left-hand side once again for the away side, but Cedric recovers and then robs the Belgian of possession. Spurs are enjoying much more of the ball, but they are simply doing nothing with it. There is no cutting edge on this pitch at the moment."
37',action,"Spurs continue to patiently build up from the back, but Kane has had very little service throughout this game. Forster has had nothing to do with his hands, apart from picking the ball out of his own net. The away side win a corner, which is taken short, before a cross from Dembele is deflected behind by Cedric."
35',action,"Once again, Cedric is fed to the right byline, but this time a delivery from the Portugal international is nodded away by Dier. Only 10 minutes remain until the break, and sloppy passes in midfield are leading to attack after attack breaking down in the middle third of the field. Maybe these two sides have had a little bit too long to rest!"
33',action,"Dembele gives the ball away terribly in the middle of the park, with Redmond then able to release Cedric on the overlap down the right. The ex-Sporting wing-back hurtles into the box and tries to cut back a cross from the byline, but Dier covers across to make an inch-perfect sliding tackle."
31',action,"Van Dijk makes a great interception, but is promptly tackled while trying to drive upfield and spark a counter-attack for the hosts. Spurs' resulting attack picks out Eriksen on the edge of the area, but the Denmark international sees a low shot deflected just shy of the left-hand post. Moments later, the same Tottenham man fires wildly over the crossbar from close-range."
29',action,"Dier lifts a cross into the box from deep on the right-hand side, which ricochets off Cedric and behind for a corner. Suddenly, Southampton are the team that look just a shade nervy. The resulting set-piece is whipped in by Eriksen, but easily cleared at the near post."
27',action,"Spurs look much more confident since Alli's header, after starting the game terribly. Boufal is trying to just do a little too much at the moment for the Saints, with the intricate play of the wide man running him into trouble a little too often."
25',action,"Walker tries to break down the right-hand side and get beyond Bertrand, but the former Chelsea defender makes a good tackle. The full-backs have been bright so far in this game, but quality in the final third has been lacking on both sides. Chances have been hard to come by as a result."
23',action,"Since equalising, the away side have held onto the ball well, with their away supporters finding their voice too. Southampton are much happier to play on the break, with Redmond and Boufal looking electric when they get up to full speed. This contest could swing in either direction before the interval."
21',action,"Suddenly this game is looking open again, as that equaliser has somewhat stunned Southampton. They looked comfortable, but suddenly the cat has been thrown among the pigeons. Davies tries to release Boufal down the left-hand side, but Sissoko tracks back to deny the Moroccan wide man."
19',goal,"Goal Bamidele Alli ; GOOOOOOOOOAL! ALLI MAKES IT 1-1! Out of nowhere for the away side! Dembele manages to releease Sissoko down the left, who then lifts a cross into the area via a minor deflection off Redmond. The England international gets above Van Dijk to guide a neat header into the top-right corner. Postage stamp stuff!"
18',action,"Big chance for Southampton! Bertrand nutmegs Walker and bursts down the left, before drilling in a dangerous cross. It is blocked initially by Rose, who denies Redmond, with Vertongen able to mop up the scraps ahead of Rodriguez. Spurs are really struggling!"
17',action,"Boufal causes some problems down the left-hand side, before a cut-back from the Moroccan to the edge of the penalty area is met by Fonte. The centre-back shoots, but sees his attempt blocked, before Southampton maintain their pressure. Redmond cuts in from the right, before shooting with a low effort that skips beyond the far post by inches."
15',yellow-card,Yellow Card Moussa Sidi Yaya Dembélé ; Dembele gets a yellow card for protesting a little too heavily after being penalised for tugging cynically on the shirt of Redmond.
14',action,"Fonte lifts a free-kick into the box from the right flank, but Spurs clear and then counter. A cross is whipped in from the same wing, but Southampton able to race away themselves. Redmond wriggles his way forward, but is then fouled."
12',action,"Great challenge from Romeu! Wanyama manages to break Southampton's pressing line with a neat pass, which sees Eriksen dance into a pocket of space. The former Chelsea midfielder recovers well to slide in and deny his man the chance to test Forster, however."
10',action,"Rose and Eriksen combine down the left, but a poor first touch from the latter robs him of the chance to shoot from close range. The Danish midfielder tries to cut back a delivery from the byline, but Romeu gets there ahead of Wanyama to clear. Puel's men respond with some great interplay down the right, but the move ends with Cedric's cross being headed away."
9',action,"Redmond drives down the right, before slotting a pass in behind for Rodriguez to chase. The Englishman gets beyond Vertonghen and into the box, but drags an eventual shot a long way wide of the far upright. He ran himself down a cul-de-sac there, really."
7',action,"Southampton are continuing to play with real pace and purpose. Davis tries to dip a cross in from wide on the right, but the Northern Irish midfielder's delivery bounces once before heading out of the danger zone. Spurs are yet to really get their foot on the ball and call the shots."
5',action,"Kane tries his luck from range, but the England international blasts high and wide of the target, to the glee of the home supporters. Pochettino will be looking for his side to get back into this one as quickly as they can."
4',action,"Spurs won't be pleased with how they have started, as that early goal has robbed them of a chance to grow into the game. Van Dijk gives away a free-kick on the right, which Eriksen bends into the box from deep, but Davis is present at the near post to clear the hosts' lines."
2',assist,"Assist James Ward-Prowse ; Ward-Prowse lifts a cross into the penalty box, which is met easily by his Dutch teammate."
2',goal,"Goal Virgil van Dijk ; GOOOOOOOOAL! VAN DIJK MAKES IT 1-0 INSIDE TWO MINUTES! Southampton win a free-kick high on the left-hand side, which sees Ward-Prowse curl a great delivery into the penalty area. The former Celtic centre-back rises brilliantly and guides a low header into the bottom-left corner."
1',action,"We are underway at St. Mary's! Tottenham need three points to try and close the gap on fourth-placed Arsenal, who are currently four points clear. With Man United's recent win against Sunderland putting the pressure well and truly on Spurs, they need a result tonight desperately."
,action,"Spurs substitutes: Son, Janssen, Vorm, N'Koudou, Wimmer, Winks, Davies."
,action,"Spurs starting line-up (4-2-3-1): Lloris; Walker, Dier, Vertonghen, Rose; Dembele, Wanyama; Sissoko, Alli, Eriksen; Kane."

,action,"Southampton starting line-up (4-3-3): Forster; Cedric, Fonte, Van Dijk, Bertrand; Ward-Prowse, Romeu, Davis; Redmond, Rodriguez, Boufal."
,action,"TEAM NEWS: Toby Alderweireld is still out with an injury, which sees Eric Dier continue in the heart of the Tottenham defence. Mousa Dembele is fit to start in midfield, with Moussa Sissoko given a rare start out on the right flank. Harry Kane leads the line, with Dele Alli in behind with license to roam. Vincent Janssen is fit enough for the bench, but Erik Lamela is still absent for Pochettino's side."
,action,"TEAM NEWS: Cedric is given the nod at right-back for Southampton, with no real changes made to their in-form defence. Oriol Romeu will anchor the midfield, with James Ward-Prowse and Steven Davis having freer roles. Sofiane Boufal and Nathan Redmond flank Jay Rodriguez up top, as Charlie Austin is out long-term with a shoulder injury."
,action,"Southampton haven't conceded in their last three top-flight matches at home, keeping clean sheets against Middlesbrough, Everton and Liverpool respectively. Spurs, meanwhile, haven't won any of their last five away outings in the Premier League. Consecutive draws against West Brom, Bournemouth and Arsenal have recently been followed up by defeats on the road to Chelsea and Manchester United."
,action,"Hello and welcome to live coverage of Tottenham's away visit to face Southampton in the Premier League. Although only two teams separate these two in the table, Mauricio Pochettino's men are 11 points clear of the Saints. The hosts, however, have lost just once at St. Mary's in league action since February, and that solitary defeat came at the hands of high-flying Chelsea."
