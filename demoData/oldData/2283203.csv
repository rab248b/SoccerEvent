As things stand, they currently sit top of the table, albeit with little over five minutes to go until Real Madrid's game against Leganes gets underway."

,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this evening…"
,action,"November’s meeting between the two sides at the Sanchez Pizjuan ended in a narrow 2-1 victory for the visitors, and this fixture has certainly been dominated by Barcelona in recent years. Sevilla have only managed to beat the reigning champions once in the last 18 games between the two, with the last win in the league coming way back in January 2010."
,action,"Sampaoli has hinted that he would be interested in replacing Luis Enrique in the Barcelona dugout next season, and the Argentine is rumoured to be on the shortlist for the job. That was before Sevilla’s recent slump, however, and in many ways his chances of being handed the reins rest on whether or not he can turn around his side’s fortunes, starting with a positive performance tonight."
,action,"Things couldn’t be more different for Sevilla, who head to the Catalan capital without a win in any of their previous four league outings. Gijon were the latest team to hold Jorge Sampaoli’s stuttering side to a goalless draw on the weekend, meaning that their last win in all competitions came over a month ago when Athletic Bilbao were narrowly beaten at home."
,action,"Barcelona suffered a slight stumble against Deportivo de La Coruna three weeks ago on what was a frustrating night for the Blaugrana, but, since then, they've managed to return to the impressive form that saw them embark on a 19-game unbeaten run in La Liga. Valencia and Granada were both easily swept aside thanks to four-goal hauls in both outings, echoing the thrashings they handed to Sporting de Gijon and Celta de Vigo at the start of March."
,action,"A third consecutive league title remains a possibility for Barcelona, who head into tonight’s big clash just two points behind leaders Real Madrid - albeit after having played one game more. A collapse of almighty proportions from Sevilla means that the race for the crown is now firmly between the two giants, and, like the last two seasons, it looks set to go right down to the wire."
,action,Good evening and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s La Liga game between Barcelona and Sevilla at Camp Nou.
