,action,"It was a slightly frustrating first half for a City side that struggled to break down the hosts, but they came to life in the second half and never looked like losing. Kompany's goal completely changed the game, and from then onwards Pep Guardiola's men were always on the front foot. Southampton continually looked open when their opponents broke quickly, and they seemed to lose all hope of initiating a comeback once Sane scored his side's second in the 77th minute."
,action,FULL-TIME: SOUTHAMPTON 0-3 MANCHESTER CITY
90'+4',action,"Navas links up well with De Bruyne over on the right-hand side of the Southampton penalty area before the Belgian fires in another dangerous cross. It flies towards the near post and looks set to cause Forster a few problems, but the goalkeeper nonchalantly kicks the ball away from danger before it can find a City player in front of goal."
90'+2',action,"Tadic tangles with Kompany deep down the right flank as the Serbian tries to skip past the Belgian and into the box, but he's easily out-muscled by the City captain and can't stop the ball from rolling out for a goal-kick."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be four minutes of added time.
89',substitution,Substitution sub-out Sergio Leonel Agüero del Castillo sub-in Kelechi Promise Iheanacho . Aguero has made way for Kelechi Iheanacho in City's third and final alteration of the game.
88',action,"Boufal, who has looked sharp since coming on to the pitch, twists and turns over on the left wing as he weaves past two players. He then unleashes an audacious cross-cum-shot, but it's slightly overhit and Bravo can watch it sail well wide of the goal."
86',substitution,Substitution sub-out Leroy Sané sub-in Raheem Shaquille Sterling . Raheem Sterling comes on to replace Sane in City's second change of the evening.
84',action,"Rodriguez gets himself into a good position just outside of the City penalty area and tries to muscle his way past Kompany, but he's unable to do so and the centre-back does well to keep the striker at bay."
82',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Shane Long sub-in Jay Rodriguez . Meanwhile, Long, who only came on to the pitch little over 20 minutes ago, is replaced by sub-in Jay Rodriguez. He doesn't look at all happy with that decision."
81',substitution,"Substitution sub-out David Josué Jiménez Silva sub-in Pablo Javier Zabaleta Girod . City have made a late change, with Silva making way for Pablo Zabaleta. That should mean Navas will push further forward."
80',assist,"Assist Kevin De Bruyne. That was more wonderful play by De Bruyne. The Belgian has arguably been City's best player this afternoon, and since the break he's caused all sorts of problems for the struggling Southampton back line."
80',goal,"Goal Sergio Leonel Agüero del Castillo. GOAL! It's another for City! De Bruyne causes further problems for the Southampton back line before lifting a lovely cross over to the far post, where Aguero rises high and nods the ball into the back of the net from close range."
79',action,"Tadic almost pulls one back! Boufal makes a nuisance of himself over on the left-hand side of the City box before teeing up Tadic, who tries to pull off a flicked shot but is closed down by blue shirts."
77',assist,"Assist Kevin De Bruyne. That was an excellent break away by De Bruyne, who was easily able to fly through a sea of Southampton players before picking out Sane with a perfect pass."
77',goal,"Goal Leroy Sané. GOAL! It's 2-0! Southampton lose possession deep inside the City half of the pitch and allow the visitors to counter quickly. De Bruyne charges down the right wing on a brilliant run as he heads towards the penalty area, and he then cleverly tees up Sane to wrap up a quick move with a lovely finish."
75',action,"Another determined Southampton attack results in the ball being flung into the box, where Yoshida rises high and sends a deflected header out for a corner. Tadic steps up and swings a dangerous cross into the penalty area, where Otamendi is able to clear the danger under pressure."
73',action,"Chance for Maya Yoshida! Bertrand battles his way down the left wing and does well to win the home side a corner. It's swung into the penalty area and finds Yoshida at the back post, but the Japan international can only send his header straight into the arms of Bravo."
71',action,"Vital interception by Stephens! Aguero bursts towards the Southampton box and only has Stephens to beat before he can test Forster, but the defender comes out on top once again with a well-timed tackle."
69',action,"Silva twists and turns deep down the right wing and cuts inside before poking a clever pass up to De Bruyne. The Belgian meets it well before trying to set up Aguero, but, not for the first time today, Stephens is there to throw his body in the way."
67',action,"Bertrand skips down the left flank on a great run as he beats two City players. He then swings a dangerous cross into the heart of the penalty area and over to Redmond, whose header back across the face of goal is well dealt with by a diving header from Otamendi."
65',action,"Two great opportunities for City! A lovely low cross from De Bruyne looks set to find Aguero, but Forster is just about able to get a hand on the ball to push it out to Silva. The Spaniard then immediately unleashes a rocket of a shot, but this time it's Stephens who throws his body in the way."
63',action,"Southampton move the ball around well deep down the right wing as Boufal gets involved in the action. He links up nicely with Tadic before trying to penetrate the penalty area, but Otamendi is there to cut out the danger."
61',action,"Almost another goal for Kompany! Once again, a curling corner from the left causes problems for the Southampton defence before falling to Kompany, but the centre-back can't get the ball out of his feet quickly enough and his poked shot is closed down well."
60',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Manolo Gabbiadini sub-in Sofiane Boufal . Meanwhile, sub-in Sofiane Boufal has replaced Gabbiadini in a change that hasn't gone down well with the Southampton fans."
60',substitution,Substitution sub-out James Ward-Prowse sub-in Shane Long . Ward-Prowse makes way for sub-in Shane Long in Southampton's first substitution of the game.
59',action,"City have looked a lot better since the break, and they're pushing forward with far more urgency. That looks as if it's going to continue as Southampton also commit bodies up the pitch in search of an equaliser."
57',action,"City keep pushing forward as they try to quickly double their lead, but, after initially linking up well with De Bruyne, Sane fires an attempted low cross out to the right flank and away from danger."
55',assist,"Assist David Josué Jiménez Silva. That was a lovely delivery from Silva, who picked out Kompany perfectly, but the Southampton defence really should have done better to deal with the City captain."
55',goal,"Goal Vincent Kompany. GOAL! City have taken the lead! The resulting corner is curled into the heart of the penalty area and finds Kompany, who beats his marker in the air and sends a bullet header into the back of the net for his first Premier League goal since August 2015."
54',action,"Rocket of a shot from Navas! Stephens does well to cut out a Toure pass but is caught sleeping on the ball by Aguero, who the young defender then clumsily fouls from behind. The resulting free-kick is curled in by De Bruyne but his delivery is flat. It bounces out to Navas though, and the Spaniard unleashes a great strike that Forster just about manages to tip over the top of the crossbar."
53',action,"Hojbjerg commits a clumsy error in the middle of the pitch and sets up Silva to counter quickly. The Spaniard darts towards the penalty area and looks set to get a shot away, but Davis is there to dispossess him with an excellent tackle from behind."
52',action,"Ward-Prowse goes close! Silva catches Davis from behind as the midfielder breaks towards the City box, resulting in a free-kick for the home side in a very dangerous position. Ward-Prowse steps up and shoots, but his curling strike flies just a yard or so wide of the near post."
50',action,"Silva and Aguero link up well deep inside the Southampton half of the pitch before the striker tries to tee up another team-mate on the edge of the penalty area. His pass is poorly hit though, and it's easily dealt with by Ward-Prowse."
48',action,"Silva is dragged back by Stephens and wins a free-kick for City just inside the Southampton half of the pitch. It's sent short and worked over to Aguero, who unleashes a shot from the edge of the box that's deflected out to Toure. The Ivorian then has a strike of his own, but it's tame and fails to trouble Forster."
46',action,We're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"It's been a relatively tame game so far, with City easily managing to dominate possession without being able to do much with it. Bar an early chance for Aguero and Sane's dangerous run into the box, the visitors have struggled to cause too many problems for the home side, who have sat deep and soaked up the pressure brilliantly."
,action,HALF-TIME: SOUTHAMPTON 0-0 MANCHESTER CITY

43',action,"Yaya Toure battles his way down the left wing and does well to win City a corner. It's curled in by De Bruyne and almost finds Nicolas Otamendi, but the ball ends up fizzing just past the head of the centre-back."
41',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Cédric Ricardo Alves Soares. Cedric flies into Fernandinho and brings the Brazilian crashing to the ground with a dangerous challenge, leaving the referee with no choice but to book him."
39',action,"Southampton enjoy what is arguably their best spell of the game as James Ward-Prowse and Redmond link up well on the edge of the City penalty area, but the latter's low cross towards Gabbiadini is cut out by Toure at the vital moment."
37',yellow-card,Yellow Card Steven Davis. Davis committed a foul in the build-up to City's last chance on goal and is shown a yellow card once the move comes to an end.
37',action,"Big call by the referee! Sane darts into the Southampton box on an excellent run before going one-on-one with Forster, who rushes out and seems to bring the German crashing to the ground with an outstretched arm. The referee doesn't agree though and only awards a free-kick to City."
36',action,"Silva goes close! Aguero, who has struggled to get into the game so far, twists and turns as he weaves his way into the left-hand side of the Southampton penalty area. He then chips a lovely cross over to the far post, where it finds Silva, but the Spaniard can only fire his first-time shot into the side-netting."
35',action,"Chance for Cedric! A looping cross from the left wing is only half dealt with by Bravo, who punches the ball out to the right flank. It's met well by Cedric and sets up the full-back to shoot, but his thumping effort is blocked inside the box by Fernandinho."
33',action,"Sane is caught in possession by Davis and Southampton counter quickly. They work the ball around nicely before Ryan Bertrand swings a dangerous cross into the box, but Kompany is able to blast it away from danger."
31',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Pierre-Emile Højbjerg. Ouch! Silva receives the ball just inside the Southampton half of the pitch and quickly tries to spin past Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, but he's caught by a clumsy sliding challenge from the Dane, who goes straight into the referee's book as a result."
29',action,"Bertrand and Redmond link up well deep down the left flank as Southampton try to break away on a quick attack, but, under pressure from Kompany, the winger runs the ball out of play before he can get himself into a good position."
28',action,"De Bruyne is able to find a pocket of space for himself over on the right-hand side of the Southampton box as he cuts on to his left foot and shoots. He's unable to make decent contact though, which results in his effort failing to trouble Forster."
26',action,"City have comfortably bossed possession so far but they've done very little with it. Southampton look really well organised and are defending in numbers, which is continually frustrating the visitors."
24',action,"De Bruyne embarks on a weaving run through a sea of Southampton players before trying to poke a pass through to Sane inside the penalty area, but it's completely overhit by the Belgian and rolls harmlessly out of play for a goal-kick."
22',action,"Southampton move the ball around quickly after space opens up in the middle of the pitch, but a promising attacking move is brought to a disappointing end by Redmond, who can't control the ball over on the left flank and allows it to roll out for a throw-in."
20',action,"De Bruyne is set up just outside of the Southampton penalty area and immediately swings a great cross into the box. It looks set to find Aguero, but Jack Stephens is just about able to get a head on the ball ahead of the Argentine striker."
18',action,"Claudio Bravo receives the ball inside his own penalty area and spends slightly too long in possession, allowing Tadic to press him. The Serbian gives the goalkeeper a slight scare but can't win the ball, as it's released at the vital moment."
16',action,"City try to embark on a swift counter-attack after bringing to an end another Southampton break forward, but they're closed down well by the hosts and have to start again from deep. The ball is moved around patiently before Navas swings in a cross from the right flank, but it's well dealt with by Cedric Soares, who chests the ball into the hands of Forster."
15',action,"What a chance for Dusan Tadic! City lose the ball in the middle of the pitch and allow Southampton to counter quickly. Redmond darts towards the visitors' penalty area before teeing up Manolo Gabbiadini, who then cuts a clever pass back to Tadic, but the Serbian's first-time shot is poorly hit and sails well over the top of the crossbar."
13',action,"More patient build-up play from City ends with Sane over on the left wing, as the German is unable to link up quickly with David Silva and loses out to a group of red and white shirts."
11',action,"An attempted Southampton counter-attack is brought to an end by Kompany, who is easily able to latch on to the end of a Redmond pass. He then charges into the hosts' half of the pitch before teeing up Leroy Sane, who's too slow on the ball and can't take advantage of the defender's good work."
9',action,"De Bruyne steps up and swings a cross into a dangerous position inside the Southampton penalty area, but the home side are just about able to deal with the threat thanks to a strong headed clearance under pressure."
8',action,"Navas pushes forward again and picks out a pocket of space deep down the right wing, where he swings in a cross that deflects out for a throw-in. It's sent short before being worked over to De Bruyne, who then forces Steven Davis into poking the ball out for a corner."

3',action,"City enjoy a good start to the game as they move the ball around nicely inside the Southampton half of the pitch. Gael Clichy is left in a pocket of space over on the left wing and is able to swing a great cross over to Sergio Aguero, but the striker is unable to fire his volleyed effort into the back of the net and sends it wide of the goal."
1',action,"We're off! City get us underway, attacking from left to right."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."
,action,"Meanwhile, City boss Pep Guardiola has made four alterations to the team that featured in their last outing, with John Stones, Aleksandar Kolarov, Fabian Delph and Raheem Sterling making way for Vincent Kompany, Nicolas Otamendi, Fernandinho and Kevin De Bruyne."

,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"October’s meeting at the Etihad Stadium proved to be a tight and tense affair, resulting in the two teams leaving with a point each. Last season’s corresponding fixture was a great one for Southampton though, as they dazzled in a 4-2 win against their opponents. They were helped by a Sadio Mane hat-trick, however, and with the Senegalese attacking midfielder now gone, it’ll be up to one of his former team-mates to impress in similar fashion if they’re to leave with another victory today."
,action,"As for City, they remain in the hunt for a Champions League spot but have struggled against top opposition over the past month. Draws against Stoke City, Liverpool and Arsenal were followed by a defeat away to champions-elect Chelsea, but they did manage to bounce back with a much-needed 3-1 victory at home to struggling Hull City seven days ago."
,action,"Southampton can call upon Manolo Gabbiadini once again thanks to the Italian managing to overcome a frustrating groin injury. The striker kick-started his career on the south coast with six goals from his first four games, and he’ll be looking to return to goalscoring form today against a City back line that has looked shaky on several occasions this season."
,action,"Southampton head into this afternoon’s big clash aiming to consolidate their place in the top half of the table with a third consecutive league victory, a feat they haven’t achieved since the final days of last season. The Saints suffered disappointing results against Tottenham Hotspur and Bournemouth before going on to beat Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion, and they’ve certainly looked more impressive in recent weeks."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Premier League game between Southampton and Manchester City at St. Mary’s Stadium.
