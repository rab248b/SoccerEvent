,action,"Evidently there is plenty more to play for in the final stages of the season, with the title race and battle for Champions League qualification receiving new life today. Thanks for joining our live coverage!"
,action,"FULL-TIME - Man United 2-0 Chelsea: After setting up Rashford for the opener, Herrera added United's second for a win that keeps their top-four hopes alive and dents Chelsea's title hopes. The Premier League leaders now hold just a four-point advantage over Tottenham, while United could move to within a point of Manchester City if they win their game in hand."
90'+4',action,THERE IS THE FINAL WHISTLE!
90'+3',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Ashley Young sub-in Timothy Fosu-Mensah . Mourinho's final change sees Young, who wore the armband today, go off to a standing ovation. Fosu-Mensah takes his place."
90'+1',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Zlatan Ibrahimović. It's a yellow card for Ibrahimovic, seemingly for something he said to the referee."
90'+1',action,We are going to have a minimum of four additional minutes.
90',yellow-card,Yellow Card Francesc Fàbregas i Soler. Fabregas goes in late on Carrick and the pair clash shins. It brings protests from the United players but the referee stays calm and takes his time before showing Fabregas a yellow card.
88',action,"Willian and Loftus-Cheek combine on the left but the latter ends up inadvertently putting the ball out of play as his cross ricochets back off him. A huge cheer rings out from the United faithful, followed by chants of ""Jose Mourinho""."
87',action,"United seem to have gathered their energy reserves for the final minutes, with the pressing returning to frustrate Chelsea."
85',action,"A tough challenge from Cahill on Ibrahimovic results in the referee giving United a free-kick near the halfway line. Young launches it long to Ibrahimovic, who cushions down for Pogba. The midfielder tries to tee up Herrera but Chelsea manager to intervene."
83',substitution,Substitution sub-out Kurt Zouma sub-in Ruben Loftus-Cheek . One last roll of the dice from Conte sees Zouma make way for Loftus-Cheek.
83',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Marcus Rashford sub-in Zlatan Ibrahimović . Mourinho said Ibrahimovic was ""very tired"" before kick-off, but that hasn't stopped the striker coming on to replace Rashford for the remaining minutes."
81',action,"Another shot from Young goes sailing over the top, but the chance only came about because of his impressive high pressing forced the Chelsea defence into a mistake."
79',action,"It's still all Chelsea. However, United are doing a great job of holding onto their lead - Chelsea are still yet to register a shot on target. They are making it difficult for the visitors to create openings, while Rashford remains a threat on the counter-attack."
77',action,"Willian swings in a corner for Chelsea, but once again it is headed away by United - Rojo getting on it this time."
75',yellow-card,Yellow Card Faustino Marcos Alberto Rojo. Rojo is shown a yellow card for a pull on Costa as he raced towards goal for an incoming long ball.
73',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ander Herrera Agüera. Herrera has watched Hazard like a hawk today, and he goes into the book for running through the back of the Belgian."
71',action,"The ball is worked well out on the left, with Pedro sent to the byline for a crossing opportunity. He drills one into the six-yard box and De Gea gets down to smother it. United had plenty of bodies back there, making it difficult for Chelsea to create the chance."
69',action,"Rashford is released down the left and uses his strength to keep David Luiz at bay, somehow working space for a shot. He sends it low towards the near post, where Begovic gets down to make a save."
68',action,"Chelsea are going to need a goal soon if they are likely to have any chance of salvaging anything from this match. They've improved since the second goal, but that is largely down to a change in approach from United."
66',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Nemanja Matić sub-in Willian Borges da Silva . An attacking move from Conte here. Willian is brought on and Matic is the man sacrificed, potentially making it a 4-2-3-1 for Chelsea."
65',action,"Chelsea get their first corner of the match but the initial ball in is dealt with. Hazard collects and pings it out to Pedro on the right. The winger cuts onto his left foot and sends a shot over, but a deflection gives the visitors another corner."
63',action,"Kane is doing his best to distribute the ball into different areas of Chelsea's attack with United more content to sit back on their two-goal cushion. It's worked to Costa, who hesitates and ends up sending a wayward pass to the opposition."
61',action,"Matic runs into trouble inside his own half and the ball is quickly sent to the feet of Rashford. He turns and rifles a shot towards the top-right corner, but he finds the side-netting, tricking a section of the ground into thinking he'd scored!"
60',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Jesse Lingard sub-in Michael Carrick . Mourinho opts for an extra body in midfield, replacing Lingard with Carrick."
60',action,Pedro peels away from Darmian to find some space at the back post. He is picked out by a brilliant cross from Hazard but is always stretching to make contact and can only volley wide of the upright.
58',action,"Fellaini concedes a free-kick for a high foot. It's taken quickly and angled towards Costa, whose first touch gets away from him and is collected by De Gea."
56',action,"Hazard attempts to thread a pass through the defence for Pedro but it is cut out by Darmian. It's a bit more positive from Chelsea, but they know they have to go after the game now."
54',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Victor Moses sub-in Francesc Fàbregas i Soler . Fabregas comes on for Moses, so it looks like Conte is switching to a back four, with Zouma at right-back and Azpilicueta on the opposite side."
53',action,"Chelsea just don't have an answer for United at the moment. Azpilicueta knicks in to win the ball on the halfway line but his pass inside only finds a red shirt, something that is becoming a recurring theme for the visitors."
51',action,"David Luiz gives the ball away sloppily, not for the first time, inviting United to come straight back at them. Rashford tees up Lingard for a shot from the edge of the box but he curls it high of the target."
49',goal,"Goal Ander Herrera Agüera. GOOOOOAAAL!! UNITED HAVE ANOTHER! Rashford's deep free-kick delivery is kept alive by Young. He drives into the box and is tackled by Zouma, who ends up stabbing the ball straight to Herrera. He fires a first-time shot at goal that deflects off Zouma and beats the wrongfooted Begovic to find the net!"
48',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Gary Cahill. Cahill gives away a free kick for a high foot on Fellaini, getting nowhere near the ball. It was a clumsy challenge and it has come at the expense of a yellow card."
46',action,United kick the second half off!
,action,"The teams are heading back out for the second half, so we will be back underway shortly."
,action,"HALF-TIME - Man United 1-0 Chelsea: A thoroughly impressive first half from Mourinho's side puts them 45 minutes away from an important win. Rashford scored the opener inside seven minutes, and United have been in control from there. Darmian and Herrera have largely marked Pedro and Hazard out of the game respectively. Will Mourinho's stifling strategy tempt Conte into tweaking his tactics at the interval? Stay tuned to find out!"
45'+3',action,There is the half-time whistle! United go in with a 1-0 lead.
45'+2',action,"WHAT A MISS! Lingard fires a pass to Fellaini inside the box and the ball deflects off him and to the feet of Young, who blasts a wild shot over."
45'+1',action,"WIDE! Chelsea break at pace and although Pedro's pass for Hazard is not accurate enough, the ball falls kindly for Costa. The striker drills a fierce 25-yard shot towards goal that arrows outside De Gea's right-hand post."
45',action,We are going to have a minimum of two added minutes.
43',action,"Azpilicueta slips when teed up for a cross on the right - he seems to have swapped flanks with Moses - and Chelsea's attack comes to an end. The defender gestures at the turf, unhappy the chance has gone begging."
42',action,"SO CLOSE! Rashford has been quite industrious in attack and he manages to hold off Moses and get a cross into the box. Cahill instinctively gets a header on it which heads dangerously towards the top-right corner. Fortunately for the centre-back, it drops onto the roof of the net."
41',action,STAT: This is the longest Chelsea have gone in a Premier League game this season without taking a shot. (via Opta)
39',action,"Young and Lingard fail to combine on the left and Chelsea get a goal-kick. They look for Hazard, who has been closely watched by Herrera throughout, and he is fouled in front of the dugout."
37',action,"David Luiz launches a long ball up which is headed into the middle for Costa by Azpilicueta. He jumps up to challenge Rojo, and ends up falling on top of the Argentine. The United defender lashes out with his hand, but it is not noticed by the officials and he goes unpunished. That could've been a lot worse for him."
35',action,"Chelsea finally manage to work a few passes together with Pedro and Hazard running into space. Herrera ends up sending the Belgian to ground as he spins away on the right and concedes a free-kick, but a push in the box relieves the pressure on United."
33',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Diego Da Silva Costa. We have the first yellow card and it has gone the way of Costa following a late challenge on Pogba. The contact did not look particularly dangerous, but he has been doing his best to get on the nerves of the opposition throughout."
32',action,"The energy United are showing here is rather impressive. They are not allowing Chelsea time to build attacks, with Zouma's response to the pressure he is put under to send a long pass straight out of play for a goal-kick."
30',action,The referee stops play with Lingard seemingly suffering from a head injury after going up for a header with David Luiz. The forward is back to his feet and looks fine to continue.
29',action,"Some superb work from Rashford keeps the ball in play on the near side, and he offloads to Pogba who rolls a pass to Young around 20 yards out in a central position. The shot that he connects with is poor and skids harmlessly off target."
27',action,"STAT: Of the last 10 times that Chelsea have conceded first in a Premier League match at Old Trafford, they have won just once. (via Opta)"
25',action,David Luiz goes on one of those marauding runs out from the back that have become a less common sight under Conte. The ball looks like it is getting away from him but this time he draws a foul from Fellaini just inside the United half.
23',action,"Rashford gets a cross in from the right after outmuscling Moses. Lingard is his target, but Begovic sticks out a fist and manages to punch the ball away from danger. That seemed like hopeful goalkeeping!"
22',action,Kante is penalised for a trip on Lingard that gives United a free-kick around 30 yards from goal. Rashford delivers it but Zouma gets it clear and Chelsea break. Pogba recovers with an exceptional tackle on Costa to bring the move to an end.
20',action,"STAT: Herrera now has five Premier League assists this season, more than he has managed in any previous campaign."
18',action,"Chelsea's only attacking ventures are coming through fast breaks at the moment and they are struggling to get a hold of possession. Pedro's foul on Herrera brings an end to their latest opportunity, though."
16',action,"A nice move from United sees Pogba, Rashford and Lingard combine to work the ball out to Young on the left. He drills a low cross into the goalmouth which is out of Rashford's reach and goes behind for a goal-kick."
15',action,"The boos ring out for Costa as he picks up the ball on halfway, but he holds off Bailly and spins away down the sideline. Costa drops to ground under slight pressure from the United defender, and a free-kick is awarded to the Chelsea. Hazard's delivery is cleared easily."
13',action,Hazard does well to keep hold of the ball in the middle and roll a pass out to Moses on the right. His cross is deflected towards the back post and is comfortably caught by De Gea. There's a bit of confrontation between - you guessed it - Costa and Rojo after the Spain international appeared to shove Bailly in the back. He gets off with a warning.
11',action,Young attempts to get beyond Moses out on United's left but the wing-back does well to get between his opponent and the ball before winning a throw-in. Chelsea are allowing United plenty of space here.
9',action,"United will be delighted with their start. They've controlled possession in the early proceedings and are taking the game to their opponents, who are having to chase the ball at the moment."
7',assist,"Assist Ander Herrera Agüera. That was a great pass from Herrera, but he appeared to handle the ball in winning it back from Matic. Referee Bobby Madley signalled for play to continue, and how the Spaniard made it count!"
7',goal,Goal Marcus Rashford. GOOOOOOAAAAL!! UNITED LEAD! An exquisite pass from Herrera curls around David Luiz and releases Rashford. He cuts across the Chelsea centre-back with his first touch and sends a cool finish beyond Begovic!
6',action,"CHANCE! David Luiz hesitates in possession and is tackled by Lingard, with the ball ricocheting in behind the defence for Rashford to latch onto. The striker snatches at his shot, though, screwing wide of the left-hand post."
5',action,"United try to slow the tempo down, knocking a few passes around near to the halfway line. Chelsea manage to press them into sending the ball the way back to De Gea, who launches a long kick forwards."
3',action,"Azpilicueta races forward down the left and is fed by Hazard. The Spaniard drills a cross into the box which is cleared, though Fellaini has to stretch for a challenge on Kante after giving the ball away to Hazard."
2',action,"Well it looks as though Mourinho has set his team out with a three-man defence, with Darmian playing centrally alongside Bailly and Rojo. Valencia and Young appear to be playing as wing-backs, with Lingard and Rashford forming a two-pronged attack."
1',action,Here we go! Chelsea get the ball rolling.
,action,"So that's two blows to Chelsea's defence ahead of kick-off. How will it impact them at Old Trafford? We're about to find out, as the teams are making their way onto the pitch!"
,action,"Here is Chelsea's amended line-up: Begovic; Zouma, David Luiz, Cahill; Moses, Kante, Matic, Azpilicueta; Pedro, Costa, Hazard."
,action,"BREAKING: Alonso hobbled off during the warm-up, seemingly clutching at his hamstring. Zouma will replace him in the starting line-up, which likely means Azplicueta will start at left wing-back."
,action,"United are currently on a 21-match unbeaten run in the Premier League, their last defeat being that 4-0 thumping at Stamford Bridge. However, included in that streak is 10 draws, which is why they remain outside the Champions League places. Mourinho is yet to beat his former club since taking over at United - they lost 1-0 at Stamford Bridge in the FA Cup last month - but this is the first time he will be in the home dugout."
,action,"Chelsea are without first-choice goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, the Belgian reportedly failing to overcome an ankle issue that could also keep him out of next weekend’s FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham. Begovic takes his place between the posts, with Eduardo on the bench. It’s the only change Conte has made from the 3-1 win at Bournemouth last time out."
,action,"The big news for United is that Ibrahimovic - their highest scoring player this season - starts on the bench, with Rashford leading the line instead. Mourinho clearly wants to ensure the towering Swede is 100 per cent fit for the visit of Anderlecht in the Europa League quarter-finals on Thursday, the tie being level at 1-1. De Gea returns after a hip issue so Romero is back on the bench, while Carrick and Mkhitaryan make way for Fellaini and Herrera."
,action,"Chelsea substitutes: Eduardo, Kurt Zouma, John Terry, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Cesc Fabregas, Willian, Michy Batshuayi."
,action,"Chelsea (3-4-3): Asmir Begovic; Cesar Azpilicueta, David Luiz, Gary Cahill; Victor Moses, N’Golo Kante, Nemanja Matic, Marcos Alonso; Pedro, Diego Costa, Eden Hazard."
,action,"Manchester United substitutes: Sergio Romero, Daley Blind, Timothy Fosu-Mensah, Luke Shaw, Michael Carrick, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Zlatan Ibrahimovic."
,action,"Manchester United (4–3-3): David de Gea; Antonio Valencia, Eric Bailly, Marcos Rojo, Matteo Darmian; Marouane Fellaini, Ander Herrera, Paul Pogba; Jesse Lingard, Marcus Rashford, Ashley Young."
,action,"Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte, who appeared to have a disagreement when Chelsea ran out 4-0 winners in the previous league meeting in October, have named their squads, so let's take a look at how the teams will line up."
,action,"This match could have quite an important bearing on the amount of pressure these sides will face in the final weeks of the season. Chelsea saw their advantage at summit cut to four points by Tottenham's 4-0 victory over Bournemouth yesterday, and defeat would be a huge boost to their London rivals' title hopes. United, meanwhile, find themselves seven points adrift of the top four. Losing today could make winning the Europa League their most realistic route for Champions League qualification."
