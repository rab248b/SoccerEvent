,action,FULL-TIME: LEVERKUSEN 0-0 BAYERN
90'+3',action,That's the final whistle!
90'+1',action,"GREAT CHANCE! Robben hits the side netting! Half of the crowd think it is in, but the winger's header has gone the wrong side of the post after a deep ball over the top by Muller. Bayern have had so many chances here tonight."
90',action,There will be a minimum of three minutes added time played here at the BayArena.
88',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Kai Havertz sub-in Leon Bailey Butler . Final substitution of the game here. The man coming off is sub-out Kai Havertz, who replaces the youngster, Leon Bailey."
86',action,"HUGE CHANCE! Lahm goes incredibly close to finally breaking the deadlock here. Muller has now switched to the wing, he fired a low ball across the six-yard box which is met by Lahm who tries to place the ball in the back of the net. However he doesn't get enough contact on the ball and it dribbles agonisingly wide of the far post, with Leno stranded in the middle of the Leverkusen goal."
85',action,Jedvaj is now the youngest player to receive three red cards in Bundesliga. Not a stat the youngster will be happy with.
83',action,"CHANCE! Kampl unleashes a powerful shot at goal from long-range, but his effort goes well wide. Any deflection and that may have been troubling Neuer."
81',action,Less than 10 minutes to play here now. Can either side break the deadlock and clinch all three points?
79',action,"The home supporters are creating an excellent atmosphere inside the BayArena, they can sense that their side need some vocal support as they continue to drop deep and be put under pressure by Bayern."
77',action,"The frustration is clear to see on the faces of the Bayern players at the moment, they have failed to capitalise on their man advantage and are not carving out any goalscoring opportunities."
75',action,"Neuer makes a big mistake, the keeper looks to pick out Bernat with a long throw but instead it is straight into the path of Bellarabi. Neuer has to sprint back to his goal as Bellarabi take a shot at goal from long range, however his shot is rushed and goes well wide of the Bayern goal."
74',action,"Leverkusen are defending very well here, they are still pressing the Bayern players high up the pitch and since going down to 10 men they haven't given Bayern any clear cut chances to score. This could be a huge point for Leverkusen if they can keep the score level."
72',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Javier Martínez Aginaga sub-in Philipp Lahm . Bayern make their third and final substitution, with Javier Martínez coming off to be replaced by the club captain, sub-in Philipp Lahm."
70',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Kingsley Coman sub-in Xabier Alonso Olano . Here is the second Bayern substitution of the game. sub-out Kingsley Coman is the man coming off and he is replaced by the experienced midfielder, Xabi Alonso."
68',action,STAT: Bayern Munich have won 71% of their Bundesliga away matches this season. Whilst Leverkusen have conceded at least one goal in 79% of their home matches.
66',action,"ANOTHER BAYERN CHANCE! Coman is beating his marker every time down the left wing and he plays a good ball into the path of Muller who tries to sidefoot the ball into the back of the net.However, Toprak is once again there to block the ball and deny Bayern a goal. Excellent block by the Leverkusen centre-back."
66',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Julian Brandt sub-in Karim Bellarabi . Leverkusen make their second substitution of the game, with sub-out Julian Brandt being replaced by sub-in Karim Bellarabi, who was a doubt before the game."
65',action,It is all Bayern now. The visitors are keeping the ball well and may now start to find even more time and space in the Leverkusen final third.
62',substitution,Substitution sub-out Charles Mariano Aránguiz Sandoval sub-in Aleksandar Dragović . Now it is Leverkusen's time to make a substitution as a result of the sending off. Aránguiz is the man heading off the pitch and he is replaced by sub-in Aleksandar Dragović.
61',action,"The resulting free-kick is taken by Alaba and it forces Leno into tipping it over the bar. The resulting corner comes to nothing. With Leverkusen now down to 10 men, this could be one-way traffic for the remaining half an hour."
60',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Douglas Costa de Souza sub-in Arjen Robben . Bayern make the first substitution of the game, with Douglas Costa the man coming off to be replaced by sub-in Arjen Robben."
59',yellow-red,"Yellow/Red Tin Jedvaj. RED CARD! Jedvaj is dismissed after receiving a second yellow card for a challenge on Muller. It looked like both players had hold of eachother, however Jedvaj then makes a rash challenge on the Bayern striker and the referee has no hesitation in producing a second yellow card."
57',action,"BAYERN CHANCE! Vidal has another opportunity to score, but he is once again denied. First of all, Muller goes close but he his crowded out by Leno, the ball falls to Thiago who lays it off to Vidal, he then fires a shot at goal which is well blocked by Jedvaj. The resulting corner comes to nothing."
56',action,Bayern need to secure just three more victories in order to clinch the Bundesliga title for the fifth successive season.
54',action,"GREAT CHANCE! Muller goes ever so close to giving Bayern the lead! Costa did very well to find space in the box and he pulled the ball back to his teammate from the byline. Muller got in-front of his marker and diverted the ball goal wards, however his effort goes inches wide of the goal."
52',action,"One player who hasn't enjoyed the best season for Bayern is Thomas Muller. The striker has struggled to score and has been left on the pitch on many occasions this season, with most of Bayern's goals coming through Robert Lewandowski. However the absence of the Polish striker means Muller is getting his chance to star tonight."
50',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Tin Jedvaj. Jedvaj is the second Leverkusen player to receive a yellow card here, for a foul on late challenge on Coman."
49',action,"Good start by Bayern. Thiago is pulling off the strings in the middle of the pitch and the Leverkusen players are struggling to get close enough to him and stop his creativity. The Spanish midfielder managed to whip a ball into the box which is met by Kimmich, however he should have left it for Muller who was in a better position behind him. Lack of communication cost them there."
48',action,"Bayern certainly ended the first half as the team on top, threatening to score every time they ventured forward. If they start to give Bayern as much time and space as they did towards the end of the half, they will be punished by the reigning Bundesliga champions."
46',action,The second half is underway!
,action,"An end-to-end first half comes to an end. Both sides had plenty of chances to open the scoring, but the best chances have comes from Bayern who didn't start the game well but they ended it on top. They will be wondering how they didn't manage to score in the opening 45 minutes."
,action,HALF-TIME: LEVERKUSEN 0-0 BAYERN
45'+1',action,That's the half-time whistle!
45',action,There will be a minimum of one minute added time played here.
43',action,"Coman uses his terrific pace to run the length of the pitch, he then pulls the ball back to the oncoming Vidal who tries an adventurous volley from the edge of the box. However he gets it all wrong and is shot goes high over the bar."
41',action,Leverkusen are starting to allow Bayern slightly more time and space in the final third as the first half starts to reach its conclusion. The likes of Costa and Thiago are starting to find a lot more time and space to be creative and carve out chances.
40',action,"ANOTHER BAYERN CHANCE! Bernat does brilliantly down the left wing, beating a couple of Leverkusen defenders, he then chips the ball into the box which is met by the on-rushing Thiago. The midfielder should score, but he gets under the ball and his header is powered over the crossbar. Excellent chance."
37',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Charles Mariano Aránguiz Sandoval. The first yellow card of the game is shown to Aránguiz for a late and high tackle on Thiago. The Bayern midfielder looks in a bit of pain, but he will be able to continue."
37',action,"WHAT A SAVE! Leno pulls off a phenomenal save to deny Coman an almost certain goal! Muller was played in behind by Thiago, he then squares the ball across the box for Coman who must score. However, Coman is off his line quickly to pull off a great save."
35',action,"This is an excellent game for the neutral here, with both teams pushing forward in search of the opening goal. Leverkusen have had more chances but Bayern had the better chance just a couple of minutes ago."
32',action,"BAYERN SHOULD SCORE! Bayern have a number of excellent chances in a matter of seconds. First Alaba has his shot superbly saved by Leno, then Javi Martinez has his shot blocked, before Vidal then looks to have headed the ball into the back of the net. However, Omer Toprak gets back to clear the ball off the line! Incredible defending by a number of Leverkusen players, but that clearance was terrific by Toprak, he denied Vidal an almost certain goal."
30',action,"CHANCE LEVERKUSEN! Volland did brilliantly down the left flank, he found his way into the box and could have pulled the trigger himself, instead he squares the ball to Brandt instead. Brandt gets there ahead of Bernat but his shot goes over the bar from the six-yard box."
30',action,"Despite this good start by Leverkusen they cannot afford to drop their guard against a team of such quality as Bayern. They have had a couple of decent opportunities in this game, but haven't forced Neuer into making a good save as of yet."
28',action,"Leverkusen are defending well at the moment, keeping their shape and forces Bayern to play through the middle. It looks like they are missing the pace and skill of Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery down the flanks."
27',action,"Head to head: Bayern Munich won 2-1 at home to Leverkusen when the two sides met earlier this season. Of the 39 matches at home to Bayern Munich, Leverkusen have won 14, drawn 9 and lost 16."
24',action,"Bayern break with pace and Thomas Muller is played through on goal, however he is forced wide and cannot work an opportunity to have a shot at goal. Therefore he tries to play a square ball to Costa on the edge of the box, but by now the Leverkusen players have got back and they manage to push Bayern back."
21',action,"Leverkusen have a free-kick in a good position down the right flank after a late and dangerous tackle by Bernat on Julian Baumgartlinger. The ball came into the box and Kai Havertz managed to get a shot at goal, but it was comfortably saved by Neuer."
19',action,"CHANCE BAYERN! Juan Bernat forces Bernd Leno into making a good save, after a good ball from Douglas Costa put him in an excellent position deep in the hosts penalty area. However Leno got down well and made a decent save."
18',action,"A sell-out crowd is here tonight in Leverkusen, cheering on their sides and so far they are creating an excellent atmosphere."
17',action,"Bayern are now starting to dominate the possession of the ball, however most of their play is in the middle of the pitch and they are struggling to work any openings in the hosts final third."
14',action,"CHANCE! Leverkusen break on the counter, they play the ball nicely into the Bayern final third. The ball then falls to Kevin Kampl on the edge of the box who had plenty of time and space to line up a shot. However his effort is straight at Manuel Neuer, who makes a comfortable save."
12',action,"Julian Brandt does very well down the left wing to win a corner off Joshua Kimmich. The winger capitalised on a mistake from Kimmich to run into the box, but the Bayern defender did well to get back and force a corner. The resulting corner is too deep and comes to nothing."
9',action,"CHANCE LEVERKUSEN! A great opportuntity for the hosts to take the lead! The ball fell to Kevin Volland on the edge of the six-yard box, he was just about to pull the trigger and score an almost certain goal. However, then Rafinha charged in and made a superb tackle to clear the danger."
8',action,"One area that Leverkusen may try to exploit, is the left centre-back position held by David Alaba. The Austrian international is not a natural centre-back, normally he likes to venture forward at every opportunity down the left as wing-back. However a player of his quality should be able to slot in with ease."
6',action,"Both sides are struggling to keep the ball at the moment, it's end-to-end in terms of possession as both teams are trying to break with pace. No chances here so far."
4',action,"Leverkusen have struggled with inconsistency throughout this season and their performances have not showed much improvement under Kurkut. For a side that should be competing for Champions League qualification, their current home record is the fifth worst in the Bundesliga."
2',action,"This could be an intense game, with Leverkusen keen to get back to winning ways. Whilst Bayern have rested several players, ahead of the Champions League second leg against Real Madrid in midweek. However the reigning champions should still have enough experience and quality to come away with the victory today."
