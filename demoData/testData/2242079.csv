,action,"That's all for our live coverage from Selhurst Park, thanks for following along. Goodbye!"
,action,"Leicester were in complete control of the match following goals from Robert Huth and Jamie Vardy, but goals from goals from Yohan Cabaye and Christian Benteke complete dramatic second-half turnaround from Crystal Palace as they salvage a draw to pull further away from the bottom-three."
90'+4',action,FULL-TIME: CRYSTAL PALACE 2-2 LEICESTER CITY.
90'+2',action,"Some really wasteful set-pieces from Albrighton as Leicester squander their chances to restore the lead. They are getting at it well here though, not just sitting back and playing for the point. A win for the Foxes would surely secure their Premier League status."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated there will be a minimum of four minutes added on at the end of this match.
88',action,"Palace are camped out in attack here and have themselves a corner. They get the big bodies forward from the back and pack the penalty area, but nothing comes of it. Still Leicester can't clear, however. Nervy moments for the defending champions here following what was once a 2-0 lead."
86',action,"Into the final minutes now and while the match remains delicately poised, the tempo has gone out quite a bit. It's looking a lot less likely now that we will see a winner, unless someone can really dig deep and find that reserve energy - it is, by all means, there for the taking."
84',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Wilfried Zaha sub-in James McArthur . Palace's second change sees the arrival of sub-in James McArthur, with Zaha surprisingly giving way."
82',action,STAT: Crystal Palace have won their last three league games at Selhurst Park – they haven’t won four top-flight home games in a row since December 1990. Wilfried Zaha and Andros Townsend had yet to be born when this occurred.
80',action,"The pace has slowed a bit as we enter the final 10 minutes, but these sides are just getting organised for one final push. By no means are either content with a draw, Palace especially, who have a bit more left in the tank with Leicester's congested fixture list leaving them a bit fatigued."
78',action,"It's on a knife edge here at Selhurst Park. In fact, the unlikeliest result right now might just be the draw, as both teams look like they have goal left in them. Who can step up and be the hero for one of these clubs, with three points going a long way to securing their safety!"
76',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Yohan Benalouane sub-in Ben Chilwell . Benalouane can't contine after all, or it's just not sensible to risk it ahead of Tuesday, as he's replaced by sub-in Ben Chilwell."
75',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Riyad Mahrez sub-in Demarai Gray . Leicester have two subs prepared, but they make just the one change here as Benalouane may have picked up a knock, so they wait and see how he carries on first. sub-in Demarai Gray enters for the final 15 minutes, with Mahrez the one replaced."
74',action,"STAT: Sam Allardyce has won his last two home games against reigning Premier League champions as a manager, beating Manchester City with West Ham in 2014-15 and beating Chelsea with Sunderland in 2015-16."
72',action,"Massive save from Schmeichel! That may just be his best of the afternoon! Benteke does so well to beat Benalouae, proving too quick and strong for the centre-half, but Schmeichel spreads himself big to make a superb stop at such a vital time for Leicester!"
70',assist,Assist Andros Townsend. Lovely delivery from Townsend who just invited Benteke to get on the end of that perfectly floated in cross.
70',goal,"Goal Christian Benteke Liolo. PALACE COMPLETE THE TURNAROUND! Benteke has been a nuisance all afternoon, consistently knocking at the door, and his persistence pays off! He climbs above a pair of defenders to get on the end of Townsend's cross and bounce a header past Schmeichel and just inside the post!"
69',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Jeffrey Schlupp sub-in Patrick van Aanholt . Palace make their first change of the match as sub-in Patrick van Aanholt makes his much-awaited return from injury, replacing Schlupp."
68',action,"King picked up a knock, hence the reason for the substitution, as he's spotted applying an ice pack to his foot on the bench. It's still an interesting decision to bring Drinkwater on, however, from Shakespear, who clearly has no desire to rest his players ahead of Tuesday's massive Champions League decider."
66',action,"NEARLY IN! Ward has no choice but to fling himself at another incredibly dangerous long throw from Fuchs, and it nearly ends in disaster as his touch sends the ball over the head of Hennessey, but it winds up crashing onto the roof of the net."
64',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Andy King sub-in Danny Drinkwater . Leicester make their first change of the night and it's King, freshly into the book, who is replaced by sub-in Danny Drinkwater."
63',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Andy King. Andy King picks up the second booking of the match, both to Leicester players - the other shown to Simpson in the first half."
60',action,"Zaha is growing into the match as well. He's really stepped up his game in the last 10 minutes and Simpson is starting to feel the effects of it. The full-back goes to ground after whiffing on a challenge and he stays there, not because he's injured, but merely taking the opportunity to collect himself and catch his breath."
58',action,"So often when you see a quick exchange of goals like that, the momentum often sticks with the side who scored second, and that's holding true here. The match has a different feel to it as it did a few moments ago, with the crowd and Palace buzzing once again. They win a free-kick high up the pitch, and Benteke's header on the end of Cabaye's cross forces Schmeichel into a save."
56',action,STAT: Crystal Palace have trailed 14 times at half-time this season and only once have they come back to win the game (D3 L10).
54',goal,"Goal Yohan Cabaye. PALACE PRODUCE AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE! Great reactions from the hosts to get that goal back in a flash! Schlupp on the left does well to get into space. His blocked shot falls for Cabaye in the centre, and the midfielder makes the most of lax marking to power a first-time effort beyond Schmeichel!"
52',assist,"Assist Riyad Mahrez. Mahrez provides the assist, but Huth's role in the build-up was of equal importance."
52',goal,"Goal Jamie Vardy. VINTAGE LEICESTER, WHO DOUBLE THEIR LEAD! That's Foxes football in a nutshell as Huth starts them on a break, before Mahrez springs Vardy, who produces a delightful touch to turn Schlupp before bending an effort in at the far post! Hennessey got both his hands to it and really should have done better to keep it out."
50',action,"Leicester remain in the ascendency, doing not just a good job of getting forward, but also taking the sting out of the match and frustrating these Palace players. The atmosphere at Selhurst remains a vibrant one, but these fans will grow restless if it stays on this course."
48',action,"Mahrez and Leicester start brightly in this second half. They attack with some good width, and it leads to a shooting chance for Mahrez, but the winger bends an effort just beyond the far post. Had it been on target, it doesn't appear as though Hennessey was getting to it."
46',action,Back underway at Selhurst Park!
,action,"Robert Huth headed home a long throw from Christian Fuchs as Leicester lead at the interval at Selhurst Park through their only attempt at goal of the match thus far, compared to Crystal Palace's seven. Huth has been a force at the other end as well, putting in a number of blocks to keep the hosts at bay. Still everything to play for, though, in the second half."
45'+1',action,HALF-TIME: CRYSTAL PALACE 0-1 LEICESTER CITY.
45',action,The fourth official has indicated there will be just one minute added on at the end of this first half.
44',action,"Mahrez goes on a long, meandering run as his skill is on display for the first time this afternoon. The winger gets into the area and tries to cut back into a nice pocket of space for a shot, but just slips at the vital moment as Palace are let off the hook."
42',action,"Palace continue to find themselves parked in the attacking half, but they're sort of sputtering out as half-time nears. They seem to be out of ideas in attack at how to find their way through this tight back four, needing a bit of instruction at the half to change the course of the match."
40',action,"Herculean effort from Huth in this first half, as he continues to be an impenetrable wall as the last line of defence. Townsend tries to take him on here, but the centre-half does really well to force him to the outside, before sliding in marvelously to block his eventual effort behind for a corner."
38',action,"STAT: Wilfried Zaha has assisted nine goals for Crystal Palace in the Premier League this season, equalling the record by an Eagles’ player in a single PL campaign (Wayne Routledge, nine in 2004-05)."
36',action,"Palace are still doing a nice job of attacking the flanks. Townsend whips a tidy ball in from the right that finds Zaha at the far post, off the head of Huth, but the winger makes a meal of it as he fails to sort his footing, sending the ball behind for a goal-kick. He had more time than he realized there."
34',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Danny Simpson. Cynical from Simpson, but important, as he blocks the run of Benteke to deny the striker from running through onto the end of a long ball forward. He really took one for the team there."
32',action,"On the other hand, Sam Allardyce will be kicking himself seeing as how these opening 30 minutes have gone. His side, usually a consistent threat from set-pieces, scoring a quarter of their goals this season from them, have been wasteful from those positions, while allowing Leicester to open the score from a dead ball situation. Palace getting a dose of their own medicine in this first half."
30',action,"Craig Shakespear will be happy with how his side have played in the opening 30 minutes, largely limiting Palace's opportunities, while making the most of their forays into attack. He has this team firing on all cylinders, but you have to wonder if he will be made to regret not resting more of his first-team regulars ahead of Tuesday's return leg against Atletico."
28',action,STAT: Leicester City have won four and lost just two of their eight Premier League away games in London since the start of last season (W4 D2 L2).
26',action,"It remains a wonderfully open match, with both sides able to glide through midfield at will. Leicester continue to pose a threat on the break, especially in the air as they whip crosses into the box at every opportunity."
24',action,"This game has started out completely opposite for Palace than that of their victory Monday against Arsenal. In Monday's game Palace were really content on sitting back and absorbing the pressure before hitting back on the break, which they did superbly. Today possession is mostly in their hands, as is the onus to try and negotiate their own space in attack, not just exploit that which is made available to them."
22',action,"Schmeichel comes off his line to try and claim the ball in the air, but Zaha does really well to head it back to Benteke as the keeper makes a mess of it. With Schmeichel off his line and struggling to recover his position, the striker looks to have a sure goal, but he's denied as Zaha is called for a foul!"
20',action,"Leicester are fine with allowing Palace the majority of possession, but they have to be a bit sharper in defence if they're going to absorb this pressure, because the hosts are starting to get through with some consistency, with Benteke especially looking in the mood."
18',action,STAT: Both Crystal Palace and Leicester have won 15 of a possible 18 points in their last six Premier League games – the only side to have won more points in their last six PL matches are Spurs (18).
16',action,"SOMEHOW IT STAYS OUT! Lovely passage of play from Palace as Benteke produces a stunning first touch off his chest to bring the ball down, get around Simpson and through on goal. Schmeichel gets out like a flash to deny him from in close, before Huth and King somehow combine to keep the rebound off the line!"
14',action,"Leicester threatening again now, packing the Palace penalty area following a string of set-pieces. The hosts struggle to combat the Foxes aerial threat, but finally are able to relieve the pressure as Huth is penalised for a shove into the back of a defender."
12',action,"THAT'S MORE LIKE IT! Hennessey comes all the way up to near the halfway line to take a free-kick, lofting a delivery deep into the Leicester box. It's met by the head of Benteke, who sees his effort deflect kindly into the path of Zaha, but the winger's first-time effort is blocked by Huth!"
10',action,"Palace have started this match with a spring in their step, but they've been almost too energetic, as it's resulted in some sloppy play on the ball. They haven't been able to ask any real questions of this Leicester defence through the opening 10 minutes, despite some decent spells in the attacking half."
8',action,STAT: Leicester have won three games in a row against Crystal Palace in all competitions for the first time since March 1925 – they’ve never won four consecutively against them.
6',assist,Assist Christian Fuchs. Fuchs' long throw sees him provide the assist.
6',goal,"Goal Robert Huth. FIRST BLOOD FOXES! Poor marking from Milivojevic and the rest of the Palace defence from a Leicester long throw, as Huth is allowed to escape the marking of the midfielder and run towards the near post to get onto the ball and guide a wonderfully placed header past Hennessey!"
5',action,"Both participants in this match have been in excellent form, scoring plenty of goals over the past two months. They've each picked up a lot of points over that span to catapult themselves out of the relegation race, at least for the time being, which should help them play loose and lead to a lot of goals this afternoon."
3',action,"There's a terrific atmosphere inside sunny Selhurst Park this afternoon, much like the one these fans generated in Monday's victory over Arsenal. That was a hostile place to play for the Gunners and the noise level just seemed to guide Palace through their sticky spells and really take the game to the visitors from start to finish."
1',action,"AND THEY'RE OFF! Crystal Palace in red and blue as they get us underway, attacking left to right, with Leicester in all white."
,action,"Craig Shakespear has not rested many of his first-team regulars, as was expected with the Champions League return leg against Atletico looming on Tuesday. The manager makes just two changes from Wednesday's first leg, with Danny Drinkwater and Shinji Okazaki getting some rest on the bench, replaced by Wilfred Ndidi and Leonardo Ulloa."
,action,"Sam Allardyce names an unchanged side for the third successive match, and why wouldn't he following a 3-0 win over Arsenal on Monday. Palace are still without a number of first-team players, but Patrick van Aanholt is no longer one of them, as the full-back has returned to training and is among the substitutes today."
,action,"SUBS: Chilwell, Drinkwater, Musa, Amartey, Okazaki, Zieler, Gray."
,action,"LEICESTER CITY (4-4-2): Schmeichel; Simpson, Benalouane, Huth, Fuchs; Mahrez, Ndidi, King, Albrighton; Vardy, Ulloa."
,action,"SUBS: Speroni, Van Aanholt, Flamini, Campbell, McArthur, Sako, Delaney"
,action,"CRYSTAL PALACE (4-2-3-1): Hennessey; Ward, Kelly, Sakho, Schlupp; Milivojevic, Cabaye; Townsend, Puncheon, Zaha; Benteke."
,action,CONFIRMED TEAM NEWS:
,action,"The Foxes aren’t completely safe from relegation just yet, though the eight points and seven teams separating them from the relegation zone has certainly provided a bit of breathing room, allowing them to shift some focus on Tuesday’s return leg against Atletico."
,action,"After winning their first six matches under Craig Shakespeare across all competitions, Leicester suffered their first two defeats under their new management in the past week, 4-2 at Goodison Park on Sunday and 1-0 away to Atletico Madrid on Wednesday in the Champions League."
,action,"Their reversal of fortunes has seen them climb well above the relegation zone, six points to be exact, having played one fewer game than both Hull City and Swansea below them, providing a renewed outlook on next season."
,action,"Crystal Palace have been on the upswing since late February, claiming victory in five of their last six in the league, the same amount as they won in their previous 25 matches to start the season."
,action,"Hello and welcome to Selhurst Park for live coverage of this Premier League match, as Crystal Palace aim to secure their place in the top-flight for next season when they play host to a resurgent Leicester City!"
