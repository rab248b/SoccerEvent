,action,"FULL-TIME! Barcelona manage to close out a 3-2 win over Real Sociedad, courtesy of an action-packed first half at Camp Nou. Messi and Alcacer popped up with the goals, which helps the struggling hosts amble their way towards El Clasico. Eusebio will be disappointed that the Basque club didn't manage to make more of a fist of it late on, but it was incredibly tight. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+2',action,"Yuri tries his luck from the left-hand side, but fluffs his lines. Barcelona try to break up the other end, with Suarez racing through on goal, but the Uruguay international shoots straight at Rulli. That was a big chance."
90',action,"There are three minutes of stoppage time at Camp Nou, with Barcelona finding themselves very close to a big three points."
88',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Gerard Piqué Bernabéu. Barcelona patiently try and see this one out, but Pique is then forced to tug Oyarzabal back very cynically. The youngster threatened to escape down the left, but the hosts' defender takes a booking."
86',action,"Messi bursts beyond two tackles and gets into the penalty area, before going down under pressure. The home fans call for a penalty, but the referee rightly just views it as strength from the defender. In the next attack, Denis rattles a shot straight at Rulli."
84',substitution,"Substitution sub-out David Zurutuza Veillet sub-in Esteban Félix Granero Molina . Zurutuza is replaced after putting a real shift in, with Granero introduced into the centre of midfield."
83',action,"Barcelona earn themselves a corner out on the right-hand side, with the initial delivery by Rakitic being cleared behind for a second set-piece. The Croatia international takes the next one short, receives the ball back, and then cuts in onto his left foot. A shot from just outside the box sails shy of the far upright!"
81',action,"We're into the last 10 minutes at Camp Nou, with Barcelona still not out of the woods yet. Real Sociedad still have a chance in this game, if the hosts keep making defensive errors. It appears that Luis Enrique is happy to see this scoreline out."
79',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Francisco Alcácer García sub-in Denis Suárez Fernández . Alcacer is replaced by Denis for the dying stages, and he will take up his position on the left-hand side of the attack."
79',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Willian José da Silva sub-in Jon Bautista Orgilles . Sergi Roberto covers across brilliantly to slide in and deny a break down the left-hand side from Real Sociedad, before Willian Jose takes his leave once the ball is out of play. Jon Bautista replaces him."
76',action,"Barcelona win a corner out on the left-hand side, but Rulli is easily able to make a catch among traffic. Zaldua drives down the right flank at pace and tries to cut back a cross, but the hosts clear their lines. The final ball is just letting the away side down slightly."
74',action,"Ter Stegen is able to make a simple catch from deep inside his penalty area, after a speculative ball into the danger zone from Canales. Barcelona attempt to counter up the other end, with Inigo Martinez coming across brilliantly to outmuscle Suarez."
72',action,"Illarramendi tries his luck from long range! The former Real Madrid midfielder spots Ter Stegen slightly off his line, and tries to ping a 40-yard effort over the goalkeeper and in. The Germany international has to parry the ball over the bar."
71',action,"Oyarzabal tries to cut inside from the left-hand side, but Pique stands up to the teenager and puts the ball behind for a corner. The ball is whipped in, with Raul Navas heading over the crossbar, but the centre-back is penalised for climbing on his man."
69',substitution,"Substitution sub-out André Filipe Tavares Gomes sub-in Andrés Iniesta Luján . Andre Gomes takes his leave after a poor performance, with Iniesta coming into the game for the last 20 minutes. Immediately, Sergi Roberto is fed through on goal, but Rulli gets there first."
68',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Luis Alberto Suárez Díaz. Suarez gets a yellow card for protesting to the referee. Barcelona are losing their cool a little bit, with a few lapses of concentration allowing for Real Sociedad to keep getting in behind."
65',action,"The whistles are out at Camp Nou, as Pique falls asleep and allows for Canales to get in behind the back four. A cross from the substitute doesn't manage to find Willian Jose square then. Moments later, Umtiti does just enough to prevent the ex-Las Palmas striker from scoring, following a good cross in from the left-hand corner."
64',action,"Willian Jose manages to earn a free-kick from Umtiti, as the French defender pushes his man firmly in the back. Real Sociedad load the box as a result, but a delivery is whipped in towards the near post area and easily cleared. Ter Stegen tries to kick long, but the hosts immediately lose possession."
62',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Carlos Alberto Vela Garrido sub-in Sergio Canales Madrazo . Vela is replaced after a rather ineffectual second half, with Canales coming into the fray."
61',action,"Willian Jose gets into the penalty area and shapes to shoot, but his hesitancy ensures that two defenders come across to dispossess the Brazilian. Suarez and Messi are trying to grab the game by the scruff of the neck with long runs from deep, but Inigo Martinez and Raul Navas have been quite comfortable."
59',action,Luis Enrique might have to start looking to his bench to try and mould this game a little bit further in the hosts' favour. Real Sociedad's midfield three have been in control for the last 10 minutes. Messi may well have to weigh in with a bit more magic.
57',action,"Real Sociedad continue to try and push up high and cause some problems, with Barcelona yet to put this game to bed. The visitors are having quite a bit of possession, with the home fans starting to grow a little bit frustrated."
55',action,"Vela and Oyarzabal haven't quite grown into this game since the restart, with Willian Jose getting little service inside the final third. Real Sociedad continue to press high and force Barcelona to play riskier, direct passes upfield. The visiting midfield three have been excellent."
53',action,"Eusebio's men continue to compete and harry Barcelona, who haven't quite been able to take control of this second half yet. Quick breaks are characterising this contest so far. Ter Stegen and Rulli have had to be very quick off their line."
51',action,"A missed chance from Messi! The hosts break down the right-hand side at real pace, but a cross from the byline is diverted a long way wide of the target by the Argentina international. A lot of players are slipping over this evening - it could have a definitive effect on the outcome of this game."
49',yellow-card,Yellow Card Asier Illarramendi Andonegi. Illarramendi gets a yellow card for tugging Messi back cynically by his shorts. The resulting free-kick is whipped straight into Rulli's awaiting grasp.
48',action,"Vela is picked out on the right-hand side, allowing for Real Sociedad to push up onto the edge of the hosts' penalty area, with an eventual cross forcing Pique to hoof clear. Moments later, Barcelona break up the other end, with a pass back to Rulli seeing the Argentine slip over. He is forced to hoof into touch."
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half in Catalonia! Barcelona are narrowly ahead, but Real Sociedad still have a real chance of causing an upset."
,action,"HALF-TIME! Barcelona head into the break in the lead, though Real Sociedad have made things interesting to leave it 3-2. Goals from Messi and Alcacer had the hosts sitting pretty, but an own goal and a neat Xabi Prieto finish have Eusebio's men in with a chance of stealing a point. Look away if you're a defensive purist!"
45'+1',assist,"Assist Willian José da Silva. Willian Jose turns provider this time, and his teammate slots home beautifully."
45'+1',goal,"Goal Xabier Prieto Argarate. GOOOOOOOAL! XABI PRIETO WITH THE GOAL! He slots a really neat finish into the bottom right corner, after a looping pass into the box from Willian Jose. Yet another classy touch from the veteran midfielder."
45',action,There is one minute of stoppage time in the first half.
44',assist,Assist Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini. Messi picked his moment to slide a neat pass in behind Zaldua.
44',goal,"Goal Francisco Alcácer García. GOOOOOOAL! ALCACER RESTORES THE CUSHION! Messi manages to take advantage of some poor defending from the away side, slotting a ball in behind for Alcacer to chase. The Spanish striker rifles a low finish across the onrushing Rulli and into the bottom corner. Great finish!"
42',own-goal,"Own Goal Samuel Umtiti. GOOOOOOOOAL! OWN GOAL FROM UMTITI! Barcelona just can't seem to clear their lines, even after a few opportunities for Ter Stegen and his back four to hack the ball away. Inigo Martinez takes control of the situation and hammers a finish through Ter Stegen's legs, which deflects off the French defender and goes into the back fo the net."
41',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Francisco Alcácer García. Alcacer gets a yellow card for blocking off Vela cynically, before complaining extensively at the linesman."
39',action,"Barcelona are happy to put themselves into cruise control and relax a little bit ahead of the break in terms of exerting energy. Yuri whips in a deep cross from the left-hand side, but Zaldua is unable to make any contact at the back post with an acrobatic over-head kick attempt. Real Sociedad's final ball has been lacking."
37',goal,"Goal Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini. GOOOOOOOAL! MESSI MAKES IT 2-0! Real Sociedad shoot themselves in the foot there. Zaldua fails to hoof an Alcacer backheel away from the danger zone, which allows for Suarez to force a save out of Rulli. The Argentine goalkeeper can't parry the ball to safety, with Messi running the ball over the line from close-range with an unorthodox flick."
35',action,"Over the bar from Alba! Sergi Roberto is released to the right byline by Rakitic, with the Spaniard needing to slide in to angle a cross into the box without the ball running out of play. Andre Gomes tees up the Barcelona left-back on the edge of the area, rather than shooting on the volley, but his teammate does no better."
33',action,"Willian Jose jinks inside to earn himself a yard of space, before shooting far too closely to Ter Stegen. The German goalkeeper has potentially been the busier of the two, but Barcelona have had by far the better chances. The hosts are looking quite comfortable at present."
31',action,"Oyarzabal plays a good ball forward into the path of Yuri, who races into the Barcelona box, but the left-back loses his footing and slips over at a vital moment. Zurutuza isn't moving too well, with the Real Sociedad midfielder having been caught quite nastily by Andre Gomes."
29',action,"Real Sociedad are struggling to retain possession for long periods, with Barcelona grabbing control of the midfield battle and the tempo. Willian Jose has struggled to get much in the way of service, with the hosts settling down and not allowing their visitors too many out balls."
27',action,"Sergi Roberto is found on the overlap down the right-hand side, before cutting a beautiful ball back square from the byline, with Alcacer picked out. The ex-Valencia forward makes all of the right movement, before failing to apply a finish. Somehow, he doesn't even send the ball goalwards!"
25',action,"Yuri tries his luck from just outside the box once again, but his effort gets charged down easily. The Real Sociedad left-back has been very keen to test Ter Stegen so far. Alba tries to feed a neat pass in behind Navas for Suarez to chase, but the visiting defender does just enough to recover and clear."
23',action,"Oyarzabal cuts in from the right-hand side and tries to bend a left-footed effort inside the far post, but the teenager doesn't get around the ball at all. It sails harmlessly wide. Real Sociedad need to try and respond quickly, as a second Barcelona goal could well kill this game."
21',action,"Barcelona haven't been at their best in this game, not by any stretch, but a bit of inspiration from Messi has them ahead anyway. The hosts are buiiding up a head of steam with their counter-attacks, but their defending leaves something to be desired."
19',action,"Real Sociedad continue to try and play their own game and keep the ball, but that strike from Messi will have really dented their confidence. Rulli manages to make a great save to deny Messi, before Suarez tries an acrobatic volley to make the most of the goalkeeper being a little dazed from colliding with his compatriot - but nothing comes of it due to a well-timed block."
17',assist,"Assist Luis Alberto Suárez Díaz. Suarez touches the ball off to Messi, after good work from Alba to find the Uruguayan."
17',goal,"Goal Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini. GOOOOOOOOAL! MESSI MAKES IT 1-0! That came from out of the blue, but Rulli couldn't do anything about it at all. Alba nutmegs Navas and cuts in from the left, before finding the Argentina international around 30 yards out. He rifles a beautiful finish into the bottom-right corner, leaving the goalkeeper with absolutely no chance."
15',action,"Raul Navas takes aim from long-range, but Ter Stegen makes a simple stop to deny the Real Sociedad centre-back. Barcelona are having a few half chances, with Messi doing well to try and cause some problems in behind the visiting defence, but largely Rulli has been the least worried goalkeeper."
13',action,"Ter Stegen denies Oyarzabal! The home side play their way through the midfield third nicely, before finding Yuri out on the left-hand side. The marauding full-back cuts back a cross from that flank, but the young forward can only direct a finish far too close the German goalkeeper. That should be 1-0."
11',action,"Messi slips a pass through the lines to Alcacer, but Rulli charges out and dives at the feet of the former Valencia striker. He gets back up and then scratches the ball off the toes of Sergi Roberto, who was following up. This contest has been even so far, with neither goalkeeper having a real save to make."
9',action,"Real Sociedad break down the right-hand side, after some great work from Zurutuza in the centre of the park, before a Vela cross is half-cleared by Pique. The rebound is picked up by the visitors and Yuri finds himself in a pocket of space, but the left-back lashes a speculative half-volley miles over the crossbar."
7',yellow-card,Yellow Card Carlos Alberto Vela Garrido. Vela gets a yellow card for showing his studs in a tackle with Alcacer.
7',action,"Umtiti slides in to deny a throughball from slipping through Barcelona's lines towards Xabi Prieto, with Real Sociedad continuing to try and press high and play the hosts at their own game. Eusebio will be pleased with how his side have started."
5',action,"Suarez plays a throughball into the path of Messi, but Inigo Martinez lashes a hurried clearance into touch. Messi changes the pace of the next attack with a lovely pass in behind Zaldua, with Jordi Alba overlapping to the left byline. The full-back cuts back a cross, but he puts it too far behind Suarez in the centre of the penalty area. Yuri manages to get the danger away and wins a free-kick from Rakitic."
3',action,"Big chance for Yuri! Real Sociedad play a few wonderful one-twos in the Barcelona final third, with Umtiti unable to hook a clearance away from the danger zone. The rebound loops out to the left-back, who rattles a low finish towards the bottom corner - but Pique makes a great block."
1',action,"We are underway in the first half at Camp Nou! Real Sociedad are always a threat at Anoeta, but away from their Basque home they rarely stand up to the test against Barcelona. Luis Enrique will hope that they rings true once again tonight."

,action,"TEAM NEWS: Alvaro Odriozola is still injured for Real Sociedad, so Joseba Zaldua starts at right-back for the visitors. Willian Jose starts up front, with Mikel Oyarzabal coming back in on the left-hand side of the attack due to a suspension for Juanmi. Eusebio goes with his strongest available side, though he doesn't have much quality to call upon from the bench this evening."
,action,"TEAM NEWS: Gerard Pique and Ivan Rakitic both are available for Barcelona after a league suspension, and both start. Jordi Alba and Sergi Roberto feature at full-back in a 4-3-3, with Sergio Busquets sitting at the base of midfield. Paco Alcacer and Luls Suarez lead the line, with Lionel Messi drifting in behind, as Neymar is serving the first game of his recent three-match suspension. Andre Gomes starts, with Andres Iniesta rested."
,action,"Some light rotation is necessary for the home side, given that they played recently, but Real Sociedad have the benefit of only having the Spanish top-flight to focus on. Eusebio's men are hell-bent on securing themselves a European place come the end of the campaign, but their form has been extremely patchy over the last month or so."
,action,"Hello and welcome to live coverage of Barcelona's home LaLiga clash against Real Sociedad, with Luis Enrique's side needing to put a midweek Champions League defeat to the back of their minds in order to focus on chasing down Real Madrid at the summit of the table. A loss to Malaga has hamstrung their title charge, with a win tonight necessarily to get the ball rolling again."
