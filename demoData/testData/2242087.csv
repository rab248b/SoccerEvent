,action,"A disappointing game with neither team creating much. Sigurdsson came closest for the Swans with his header late on but in the end, it was Capoue capitalising on Mawson's error that decided the game. Paul Clement's side looked to apply more pressure after the break and took charge of the game but in the end they were unable to create any meaningful chances and have now scored only one goal in their previous five games. Watford, meanwhile, have reached their 40 point tally with a victory that has pretty more assured their Premier League status for another season."

45',action,The fourth official has indicated there will be one minute of added time.
42',goal,"Goal Etienne Capoue. Unbelievable. Mawson gifts Watford an opportunity on the edge of the box as he dawdles on the ball. Etienne Capoue nicks it off him, his right-footed effort is parried away by Fabianski but Capoue runs onto the follow up to rifle the ball into the roof of the net.

38',action,Holebas is left with space on the left to cross the ball into the Swansea box. His cross is poor and again Fabianski is able to comfortably collect. Neither side causing many problems at the moment. Deeney's effort earlier being the best chance of the game so far.
