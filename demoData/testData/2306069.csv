,action,"What an end to an excellent game! Milan looked dead and buried when Inter went 2-0 up, but they showed great grit and determination to fight back and leave with a well-earned point thanks to a contentious late equaliser. The goal was scored almost two minutes after the alotted time had come to an end, and that will surely feature in Stefano Pioli's post-game interview."
,action,FULL-TIME: INTER 2-2 MILAN
90'+7',assist,"Assist Carlos Arturo Bacca Ahumada. Locatelli did really well to beat his man in the air before setting up Zapata, but the Inter players are absolutely fuming. The goal was scored deep into the 97th minute, despite the referee only awarding five extra minutes."
90'+7',goal,"Goal Cristian Eduardo Zapata Valencia. GOAL! Milan have equalised with the last minute of the game! The Rossoneri are presented with one last opportunity to fire the ball into the box after Deulofeu wins them a corner over on the right wing. It's swung into the penalty area and finds Locatelli, who nods the ball over to Zapata and sets up the defender to fire a shot over the line off the underside of the crossbar. Crazy!"
90'+6',action,"Biabiany almost makes it 3-1! The resulting free-kick is fired down the left wing, where it finds Eder. The forward cuts inside and along the box before teeing up Biabiany, whose thumping strike flies a few yards over the top of the crossbar. That should be that for Inter."
90'+5',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Manuel Locatelli. Ouch! Milan desperately push forward on one last attack, but it's brought to an end by Nagatomo. The Japanese defender tries to clear the danger but is clattered into by Locatelli, who receives a booking for a high and dangerous challenge."
90'+3',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Roberto Gagliardini. Gagliardini flies into a challenge over on the left flank and gives away a free-kick in a dangerous position. It's swung into the penalty area and finds Zapata in front of goal, but the centre-back's downward header is easily stopped by Handanovic."
90'+2',action,"De Sciglio breaks down the right wing on a purposeful run before threading a lovely ball into the Inter penalty area and towards Suso, but the Spaniard is unable to reach it after being beaten to the pass by Joao Miranda, who then shepherds the ball out for a goal-kick."
90'+1',substitution,Substitution sub-out Antonio Candreva sub-in Jonathan Ludovic Biabiany . Candreva makes way for Jonathan Biabiany in a late alteration for the Nerazzurri.
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be five minutes of added time.
89',action,"Huge chance for Eder to wrap up the win! After dealing with the danger, Inter break away on a blisteringly quick counter-attack. Eder charges down the right wing and cuts inside before trying to set up Icardi, but his pass is poor and deflects off a defender before hitting his hand, resulting in a free-kick."
88',action,"Plenty of Milan players fly down the right flank as each try to swing a cross into the penalty area, but they have to settle for a free-kick in a dangerous position. Suso steps up and curls a cross towards a group of white shirts, but Handanovic darts out to deal with the danger with a strong punch."
86',yellow-card,Yellow Card Samir Handanovič. Handanovic becomes the latest player to enter the referee's book for dissent.
85',action,It's all Milan as they continue piling forward in search of an equalising goal. Inter now have almost every available player behind the ball as they desperately try to hold on to a lead that's now looking slender and shaky.
83',assist,"Assist Jesús Joaquín Fernández Sáez de la Torre. It's been a really tough day for Suso, who has largely lost out to Nagatomo, but the Spaniard did really well there to set up Romagnoli. Can Milan go on to find an equaliser?"
83',goal,"Goal Alessio Romagnoli. GOAL! Milan have pulled one back! Suso, who has had a tough time this afternoon, twists and turns over on the right wing before swinging a cross into the box and over to Romagnoli, who sticks out a foot and pokes a volleyed shot into the bottom right-hand corner of the net. Game on!"
81',action,"Ocampos is quickly able to get involved in the game before he fires in a dangerous cross from the left flank, but, not for the first time today, Medel is there to skip in front of Bacca and beat the Colombian to the ball at the vital moment."
80',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Davide Calabria sub-in Lucas Ariel Ocampos . Meanwhile, Calabria has made way for Lucas Ocampos for Milan. It looks as if they're going to play with a three-man defence for the final 10 minutes."
80',substitution,"Substitution sub-out João Mário Naval da Costa Eduardo sub-in Jeison Fabián Murillo Cerón . Inter have made their second change of the afternoon, with Jeison Murillo coming on to replace Joao Mario in a defensive switch."
79',action,"Big opportunity for Lapadula! Bacca weaves his way into the right-hand side of the Inter box and rounds Handanovic before chipping a dangerous cross over to the far post, where Lapadula rises high but, under pressure from D'Ambrosio, is unable to get a head to the ball."
78',action,"Inter patiently hold on to the ball deep inside the Milan half of the pitch after an attempted Rossoneri attack fails to result in a chance on goal. Unsurprisingly, they don't look to be in a huge rush to push forward, as they seem content to try and hold on to their two-goal lead."
76',action,"Fernandez and Deulofeu link up well deep down the left flank before the Spaniard skips past Gagliardini and towards the penalty area. He holds on to the ball for slightly too long, however, and can only run it out for a goal-kick."
75',substitution,"Substitution sub-out José Ernesto Sosa sub-in Gianluca Lapadula . Sosa seems to have picked up a slight injury, and he's replaced by sub-in Gianluca Lapadula for the final quarter of an hour."
73',action,"Nervy moments at the back for Inter! Handanovic darts out to deal with a loose ball but can only spill it into the path of Bacca, who then tries to poke the ball into the back of the net. He's unable to do so though, as the Slovenian does really well to make amends for his error."
71',action,"A clever pass from De Sciglio finds Bacca on the edge of the Inter penalty area. The Colombian tries to hold off Medel as he attempts to spin and shoot, but the centre-back remains glued to his opponent and does really well to poke the ball away from danger."
69',action,"Milan patiently pass the ball around just inside the Inter half of the pitch before Suso tries to skip past Eder, but he's quickly closed down by the forward and is comfortably dispossessed before he can pick out a team-mate with a pass."
68',substitution,Substitution sub-out Ivan Perišić sub-in Eder Citadin Martins . Perisic receives a rousing round of applause from the Inter fans as he's replaced by Eder.
66',action,"Great save by Handanovic! Nagatomo tries to hold off Calabria deep down the right flank but accidentally touches the ball, resulting in a corner for Milan. It's swung in by Sosa and almost finds Cristian Zapata but is deflected out to Deulofeu, who unleashes a beautiful strike that Handanovic does well to parry away from goal."
64',action,"The pace of the game has slowed down somewhat as Inter take their foot off the pedal slightly. They seem content to sit deep and soak up the pressure, meaning that it's all Milan at the moment as they desperately try to find a way back into the contest."
62',action,"Deulofeu goes down inside the box, but nothing is given! The Spaniard, who has arguably been Milan's best player today, skips down the left wing once again before taking on D'Ambrosio and going down under a tackle. He immediately screams for a penalty but the referee shakes his head, much to the annoyance of the on-loan winger."
60',action,"Excellent block by Medel! Bacca is set up deep inside the Inter penalty area and looks set to test Handanovic from close range, but as soon as he unleashes a rocket of a low shot, Medel dives in front of the effort to deflect it away from goal."
58',action,"What a run by Deulofeu! The Spaniard sprints down the left wing and easily beats two Inter players before poking a beautiful pass across the face of goal, but there's nobody there to meet it and Nagatomo can blast the ball back towards the halfway line."
57',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Juraj Kucka sub-in Manuel Locatelli . Milan have decided to make their first substitution of the game as they try to find a way back into the game, with sub-in Manuel Locatelli coming on to replace Kucka, who was quiet this afternoon."
56',action,"Great opportunity for Perisic to make it 3-0! A half-hearted Milan attacking move breaks down and allows Inter to break forward on a swift counter-attack. Icardi charges down the left wing before cutting inside and picking out Perisic on the edge of the box, and the Croatian immediately side-foots a first-time shot straight into the hands of Donnarumma."
55',action,"Almost another chance for Inter! Gagliardini lifts a lovely pass over the Milan defence and into the box, where Icardi nods the ball down to Candreva. The winger takes a quick touch before trying to set up Gagliardini, but his pass is poor and rolls past the midfielder."
54',action,"Perisic does well to skip past Calabria and into the left-hand side of the Milan penalty area after playing a quick one-two with Joao Mario, but he's unable to finish off the move by picking out a team-mate and instead scuffs his attempted pass out for a goal-kick."
53',action,"Joao Miranda is put under pressure down the right wing by a group of white shirts and is forced into poking the ball out for a corner. It's sent short before a cross is curled over to Kucka, who unleashes an audacious overhead kick that's easily dealt with by Handanovic."
51',action,"Kondogbia is caught in possession in the middle of the pitch and allows Suso to counter quickly down the right flank, but Yuto Nagatomo is there to quickly dispossess the Spaniard before he can get himself into a decent position."
49',action,"Candreva goes close! Milan are unable to clear the danger from the edge of their own penalty area and allow Joao Mario to poke the ball over to Candreva. The winger immediately unleashes a thumping shot towards the near post, but it fails to hit the target and fizzes just wide of the goal."
47',action,"Perisic does well to keep the ball in play deep down the left flank before swinging a dangerous cross into the penalty area and towards Icardi, who sticks out a foot but is unable to beat Alessio Romagnoli to the ball at the near post."
46',action,We're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half.
,action,"Ironically, Inter have been second best to their rivals for much of the game so far, but they nonetheless head into the break with a 2-0 lead thanks to two well-worked goals. Both should have been dealt with better by the Rossoneri, however, and Vincenzo Montella will certainly feel frustrated that his side find themselves in such a disappointing position with 45 minutes left to play."
,action,HALF-TIME: INTER 2-0 MILAN
45'+1',action,"Milan pile plenty of bodies forward as they try to carve open one last chance on goal, but they're unable to find a way through the sea of black and blue camped in front of them and have to head into the half-time break two goals down."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be just one minute of added time.
44',assist,Assist Ivan Perišić. Perisic has been one of Inter's quietest players but was excellent in the build-up. He easily skipped past Calabria down the left wing before presenting Icardi with the easiest of chances to score.
44',goal,"Goal Mauro Emanuel Icardi Rivero. GOAL! It's 2-0 to Inter! Perisic skips past Calabria far too easily before cutting inside and fizzing a low pass across the face of goal, where it finds Icardi. The captain is completely free a few yards off the line and is easily able to tap in his first ever derby goal."
43',action,"Almost another chance for Bacca! Milan keep pushing forward as they desperately try to find an equaliser before half-time. This time it's Fernandez who pokes a clever pass towards Bacca inside the box, but Handanovic closes down the Colombian well before the linesman's flag is raised for offside."
42',action,"Another chipped pass is thumped into the Inter penalty area and towards Bacca, who has been presented with few chances to impress today, but, once again, the striker is unable to get the better of Medel, who sticks to him like glue."
40',action,"Huge opportunity for Icardi! Milan lose the ball in the middle of the pitch and allow Inter to counter quickly. Joao Mario darts down the right wing on a great run before firing an even better low pass across the face of goal, where it ends up flying just inches past the outstretched foot of Icardi. Any sort of contact surely would have made it 2-0."
38',action,"Bacca almost goes through on goal! Milan quickly push forward from the restart as a lofted pass is fired into the Inter penalty area and towards Bacca, but just as the Colombian looks set to control the ball and shoot, he has it headed away from him by Medel."
37',yellow-card,Yellow Card Antonio Candreva. Candreva immediately ripped his shirt off when celebrating his goal and is shown a booking for his overzealous antics.
36',assist,"Assist Roberto Gagliardini. That was a great pass forward from Gagliardini to pick out Candreva, but De Sciglio didn't judge the flight of the ball at all well enough and really should have done more to deal with it."
36',goal,"Goal Antonio Candreva. GOAL! Inter have taken the lead! Gagliardini fires a great lofted pass over the Milan defence and into the penalty area, where it finds Candreva and sets up the winger to fire a looping volley past Donnarumma. The Nerazzurri haven't been at their best but nonetheless find themselves in front!"
34',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Juraj Kucka. Great goalkeeping by Handanovic! Deulofeu flies down the left wing and sprints past Medel with ease as he darts into the Inter box. He heads towards the near post before taking on Handanovic, who sticks out an arm to poke the ball away from the Spaniard. It then rolls out to Kucka, who goes down under a tackle from Gagliardini, but he threw himself to the ground far too easily and is booked for diving."
33',action,"Chance for Milan! Sosa breaks down the left wing on a quick run and looks set to set up Bacca inside the penalty area. He takes slightly too long in making his mind up, however, and can only unleash a scuffed cross-cum-shot, and it's one that fails to find his team-mate before looping on to the roof of the net."
31',action,"Milan continue working the ball around well as they enjoy a decent spell of possession, but a hopeful punt forward fails to find Bacca inside the Inter half of the pitch and is instead cut out by the head of Joao Miranda."
29',action,"Suso is caught from behind by a clumsy challenge from Kondogbia, resulting in a free-kick for Milan on the halfway line. It's sent short and worked back over to Suso, whose dangerous cross into the box almost finds Bacca but is headed away well by Gary Medel."
27',action,"Inter are enjoying a lot more of the ball inside the Milan half of the pitch as the pace of the game starts to slow down, but the Rossoneri are defending well to frustrate their rivals. They've looked particularly good out on the right, where Calabria is managing to keep Perisic very quiet."
25',action,"Both sides are finding plenty of space available whenever they counter quickly, indicating just how open this game has become. This time it's Milan who break away through Deulofeu after Sosa dispossesses Geoffrey Kondogbia, but he's closed down just outside of the box and is unable to unleash a shot."
23',action,"Kucka is closed down quickly by Joao Mario and gifts possession to Inter. They push forward once again before Candreva fires in a cross from the right wing, but it's sent far too near to Gianluigi Donnarumma and is easily collected by the young goalkeeper."
21',action,"D'Ambrosio links up well with Gagliardini deep down the right flank before the full-back tries to curl a cross into the penalty area, but it's well defended by De Sciglio and is headed out for a throw-in that is also dealt with well by the Rossoneri."
19',action,"Calabria embarks on a great run down the right flank as he tries to latch on to a thumped pass forward, but he's unable to make decent contact with it and has to settle for a corner. It's curled into the box and towards Kucka, but Icardi is there to clear the danger once again."
17',action,"Milan are put under pressure deep inside their own half of the pitch as they struggle to clear the danger. The ball is worked around well by their opponents before a swinging cross is curled into the box, but there are plenty of white shirts there to deal with it without too many problems."
15',action,"Vital interception from De Sciglio! After dealing with the danger, Inter break away on an incredibly quick counter-attack down the left flank. Icardi is set up by Joao Mario before the captain tries to poke a pass over to Antonio Candreva, but De Sciglio sticks out a foot to make sure that the ball can't find the winger on the edge of the box."
14',action,"Deulofeu hits the post! The resulting corner fails to result in a chance on goal before the ball finds its way to Deulofeu, who skips into the right-hand side of the Inter box on a wonderful run before unleashing a low shot that smashes off the woodwork."
13',action,"Great strike by Suso! The Spaniard isn't closed down quickly enough by Ivan Perisic and is able to unleash a rocket of a shot from the 25 yards out, but Handanovic is just about able to tip it round the near post with a quick diving save."
12',action,"Deulofeu twists and turns deep down the left flank before cutting inside and being tripped over by Danilo D'Ambrosio, resulting in a free-kick for Milan in a very dangerous position. Jose Sosa steps up and whips a cross-cum-shot towards goal, but Icardi is easily able to head it away from the near post."
10',action,"An Inter attacking move breaks down and allows Fernandez to pick up the ball on the halfway line before swinging a lofted pass over to Davide Calabria. The youngster had made a good run down the right channel but can't reach the ball, despite his best efforts."
8',action,"Inter win themselves a corner over on the right flank, but it's well dealt with by the Milan defenders and results in a quick counter-attack by the Rossoneri. Suso sprints deep into the Inter half of the pitch before threading a lovely through-ball towards Deulofeu, but Handanovic is there to beat the Spaniard to the pass with an outstretched arm."
6',action,"Mauro Icardi goes close to opening the scoring! Joao Mario showcases great skill as he darts down the left wing before chipping a beautiful ball into the heart of the Milan penalty area. It sails past two defenders before reaching Icardi, but the captain is put under pressure from Mattia De Sciglio and can only poke his close-range shot wide of the near post."
4',action,"Milan work the ball around nicely as they continue pushing deep into the Inter half of the pitch. Suso gets himself in a good position out on the right flank before firing a looping cross into the box, but it's slightly overhit and sails over the head of Matias Fernandez, who had made a good run towards goal."
2',action,"Huge chance for Milan early on! Roberto Gagliardini is caught in possession midway inside the Inter half of the pitch, allowing Gerard Deulofeu to pick up the ball and sprint towards the penalty area. He forces Samir Handanovic into making a decent save before Juraj Kucka's follow-up is deflected over to Carlos Bacca, whose close-range volley sails high over the top of the crossbar."
1',action,"We're off! Inter get us underway, attacking from left to right."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."
,action,"Meanwhile, Milan boss Vincenzo Montella has made just one alteration to the team that featured in their last outing, with Mario Pasalic making way for Matias Fernandez."
,action,"Stefano Pioli has decided to make three changes to the Inter side that started the defeat against Crotone last weekend, with Yuto Nagatomo, Roberto Gagliardini and Joao Mario coming into the starting line-up to replace Jeison Murillo, Cristian Ansaldi and Ever Banega, respectively."
,action,"Milan substitutes: Lapadula, Honda, Ocampos, Gomez, Poli, Vangioni, Paletta, Storari, Antonelli, Plizzari, Locatelli."
,action,"Milan XI (4-3-3): Donnarumma; Calabria, Zapata, Romagnoli, De Sciglio; Kucka, Sosa, Fernandez; Suso, Bacca, Deulofeu."
,action,"Inter substitutes: Andreolli, Palacio, Biabiany, Ansaldi, Banega, Sainsbury, Santon, Eder, Murillo, Carrizo, Brozovic, Gabriel."
,action,"Inter XI (4-2-3-1): Handanovic; D’Ambrosio, Medel, Joao Miranda, Nagatomo; Gagliardini, Kondogbia; Candreva, Joao Mario, Perisic; Icardi."
,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up today..."
,action,"Derby games involving the two Milan sides often prove to be exciting and close-fought affairs, and that has proven to be the case in recent years. The meeting between the two teams earlier in the season ended in a tight 2-2 draw after Ivan Perisic scored a last-minute equaliser, whilst wins from the previous four games were shared between the two bitter rivals."
,action,"Many of Inter’s problems can be explained by their shaky back line, which has conceded 11 times in six games despite only shipping one goal in the five outings prior to that. They struggled against both Sampdoria and Crotone and could be in for more problems today if they’re not at their best. Another defeat would leave Inter five points behind their rivals, severely denting their hopes of qualifying for Europe."
,action,"As for Inter, the impressive start made under Stefano Pioli seems to be a thing of the past, as they are now without a win in their last three league games - their worst run since October. A disappointing defeat against Sampdoria was bad enough before the Nerazzurri fell to minnows Crotone, who made their opponents look incredibly average during last weekend’s miserable outing."
,action,"Milan's Sicilian opponents are currently suffering a torrid time at the wrong end of the table, so today’s game represents the Rossoneri's biggest test since facing Juventus little over a month ago. Genoa were also beaten since that frustrating evening in Turin, whilst Vincenzo Montella’s men suffered a slight setback away to Pescara in a game that saw them have to fight back from a goal down to draw 1-1."
,action,"It’s fitting that the first game under the new Milan owners should be the Derby Della Madonnina, and it brings together rivals that are both battling hard for a place in next season’s Europa League. Milan certainly head into the big clash in the better form, as last weekend’s thumping of Palermo means that Juventus are the only side to have beaten the Rossoneri in their previous nine league outings."
,action,Good morning and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Serie A game between Inter and AC Milan at San Siro.
