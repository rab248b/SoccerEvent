,action,"That's all from us for today folks, thanks for joining us and we hope you can join us again soon."
,action,"Real Madrid go six points clear of Barcelona at the top of the La Liga table, for a few hours at least, thanks to Isco’s dramatic late winner. Madrid had to twice come from behind to draw level after goals from Duje Cop and Mikel Vesga, and did so through Isco and Alvaro Morata, before Isco drilled the ball past Ivan Cuellar in the 90th minute to seal all three points for Zinedine Zidane’s side."
,action,Full-time: Sporting Gijon 3-2 Real Madrid
90'+4',action,"Madrid win a corner and make no attempt to put it in the middle, with Marcelo and James keeping the ball in the corner looking to run down the clock."
90'+2',yellow-card,Yellow Card Akram Hassan Afif. Afif is shown a yellow card for a foul moments after coming on.
90'+2',substitution,Substitution sub-out Sergio Álvarez Díaz sub-in Akram Hassan Afif . Another change for Sporting with Akram Afif coming on to replace Alvarez.
90',assist,Assist Marcelo Vieira da Silva Júnior. Marcelo played a simple pass into Isco who turned superbly well and fired the ball past Cuellar.
90',goal,"Goal Francisco Román Alarcón Suárez. GOOOOAAAALLLLL!!!!! Isco surely wins it for Madrid!!! The Spaniard has been Madrid’s best player by far today and he picks up the ball 20 yards out from goal after Sporting had given the ball away cheaply to Marcelo, before turning and firing the ball low into the bottom corner from the edge of the box."
89',substitution,Substitution sub-out Mateo Kovačić sub-in Carlos Henrique Casimiro . Kovačić is replaced by Casimiro in Madrid's final change.
89',yellow-card,Yellow Card Álvaro Borja Morata Martín. Morata as shown a yellow card for something he said to the referee.
89',action,"It’s all pretty chaotic inside the Sporting penalty area as the Madrid players appeal for a penalty for handball, but the referee isn’t interested and waves play on as Cuellar gratefully dives on the ball after a goalmouth scramble."
87',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ignacio Cases Mora. Mora goes into the book for a foul on Isco, although he seems to think there was a handball in the build up by Isco."
85',action,Ndi brings down Kovacic with a clumsy challenge 35 yards out from goal and Madrid have free-kick in a dangerous area in the centre of the field. James though goes for goal from the free-kick and thumps the ball straight into the wall.
83',action,Sporting are defending with all eleven men behind the ball now and their fans are whistling loudly as Madrid knock the ball around the back four. The home side are keeping a good defensive shape though and looking solid at the minute.
81',action,"Chance!! James whips in a superb cross from a corner on the left-hand side and Mariano gets up well on the edge of the six yard box, but he can only fire his powerful header over the bar, although it was straight enough so Cuellar would more than likely have saved it anyway."
79',substitution,Substitution sub-out Duje Čop sub-in Daniel Arnaud N'Di . Another change for Sporting and it's the first goalscorer Čop who goes off to be replaced by sub-in Daniel Arnaud N'Di.
79',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ismael López Blanco. Lopez has been shown a yellow card following that foul, although it is unclear whether it was for the foul or for complaining to the referee about Nacho's reaction."
78',action,"Sporting are by no means out of this game though as Carmona very nearly gets on the end of a cross from the right-hand side, but Nacho does enough to head the ball away before being brought to ground, earning his side free-kick inside his own half and a chance to get the ball forward once again."
75',action,"Madrid are certainly starting to turn the screw on Sporting now but they still haven’t created too many clear-cut opportunities, and they’ll be wary of throwing too many bodies forward and leaving themselves exposed."
73',action,"CLOSE!!! Isco shows more exceptional footwork, skipping away from several Sporting players as he drives into the box from 30 yards out, and although he can’t quite get a shot away himself he knocks the ball onto Danilo who picks out Marcelo at the back post, but the left-back fires his low, drilled effort inches wide of the far post from 12 yards out."
71',substitution,Substitution sub-out Lucas Vázquez Iglesias sub-in Mariano Díaz Mejía . Another change for Madrid as Vázquez is replaced by sub-in Mariano Díaz Mejía.
70',action,"Danilo and Marcelo, the two Madrid full-backs, are both playing really high up the pitch now and both have the opportunity to cross within a few seconds of each other, but Danilo’s cross is behind Morata and Marcelo’s is far too deep to cause any problems for Sporting."
69',substitution,Substitution sub-out Moisés Gómez Bordonado sub-in Ignacio Cases Mora . A first change for Sporting now as sub-in Ignacio Cases Mora comes on to replace Moi Gomez.
67',action,"Asensio shifts the ball onto his left foot and shoots powerfully towards goal, but Sporting get enough bodies in the way to block the shot, allowing Cuellar to catch the ball high above his head after it had ballooned up into the air."
65',action,That equaliser looks to given Madrid renewed confidence and energy and they’re just getting on top again now and are looking to get the ball into wide areas at every available opportunity.
63',action,"Disallowed goal!! This game is really opening up now as Lopez fires wide of the Madrid goal at one end with a low 20-yard shot before Madrid get the ball in the back of the net at the other after a good initial save from Cuellar, but the flag is up for offside against Morata so the goal won’t count."
61',yellow-card,Yellow Card Manuel Castellano Castro. Castellano has been shown a yellow card after players from both sides came together following that foul by Lillo on Morata.
61',action,CLOSE!!! Lillo goes flying in with a crunching tackle on Morata and Madrid are awarded a free-kick 40 yards out on the left-hand side. James swings in the free-kick and Danilo attacks it but heads it just wide from seven yards out.
59',assist,Assist Danilo Luiz da Silva. Danilo hasn’t had many opportunities for Madrid this season but he’s been impressive throughout this game and put a wonderful cross in for Morata there.
59',goal,"Goal Álvaro Borja Morata Martín. GOOOAAAAALLLLLLL!!! Morata draws Madrid level!! Danilo stands up a superb cross from the right-hand side towards Morata at the back post, and the centre-forward climbs above the defender to head the ball powerfully back across goal and into the corner."
57',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Fábio Alexandre da Silva Coentrão sub-in Marcelo Vieira da Silva Júnior . A first change for Madrid now as Marcelo comes on to replace Coentrao, who hasn’t played a huge amount of football this season."
56',action,Ramos is allowed to bring the ball well inside the Sporting half before laying it off to Coentrao outside him. The Sporting midfield just backed off the centre-back there and that could be a dangerous tactic with over half an hour still to go in this game.
54',action,"James picks the ball up 25 yards out from goal and cuts inside to create space for the shot on his left foot, but he can only fire it straight down the throat of Cuellar in the Sporting goal."
52',action,"Zinedine Zidane is shaking his head in disbelief on the touchline, and understandably so as that was pretty sloppy defending from his side and the goal really came out of nowhere."
50',assist,"Assist Jean-Sylvain Babin. Babin's header was a good one back into the middle, but Madrid will be wondering how he was allowed so much space as he was completely unmarked."
50',goal,Goal Mikel Vesga Arruti. GOOOOAAAAALLLLLL!!!! Sporting take the lead!!! Babin gets up well beyond the back post and heads an angled cross back into the middle where Vesga meets it and loops a header over Casilla and into the far corner.
48',action,"What a save!!! James floats in the resultant free-kick and picks out Nacho who is unmarked six yards out from goal at the back post and looks almost certain to score, but Cuellar somehow keeps it out."
47',action,Madrid look to have picked up where they left off at the end of the first half as Isco shows exceptional footwork once again before being brought to ground by Amorebieta just outside the penalty box on the left-hand side.
46',action,Kick-off! Sporting get the second half underway.
,action,"Sporting boss Rubi will be asking for more of the same from his side, who’ve defended well and looked a threat going forward on occasions, particularly down the left. Zinedine Zidane though may well turn to his bench early in the second half if the second goal does not come, with Toni Kroos, Luca Modric and Casemiro all at his disposal."
,action,"It’s all square at El Molinon after Isco cancelled out Cop’s well taken opener with a superb individual goal inside the first 20 minutes. Madrid have been the better side and could have taken the lead when Vasquez headed over from seven yards out, but other than that they’ve failed to trouble Ivan Cuellar in the Sporting goal."
,action,Half-time: Sporting Gijon 1-1 Real Madrid
43',action,"Madrid are awarded a free-kick close to the byline on the right-hand side as Lopez pushes Danilo to the ground after the Madrid right-back had made another good overlapping run. James looks to go for goal from the free-kick despite the tight angle but drills it straight into the wall, much to the frustration of Ramos and Nacho who had made their way forward from the back."
41',action,"Isco shows more good footwork, this time to free up Coentrao down the left-hand edge of the penalty box, but the left-back’s low cross is behind both Morata and Vasquez in the middle and Sporting are able to clear the ball away."
39',action,The referee has to come in and intervene as Asensio reacts badly to a coming together with Lillo off the ball. It does look as though the Sporting right-back may have had a little kick out at Asensio then but it’s hard to tell whether or not it was deliberate.
37',action,"Close!! Madrid come close to taking the lead as James slides a low cross across the six yard box from the left-hand side towards Vasquez at the back post, but Mere does exceptionally well to slide in and turn the ball away from danger. The centre-back did extremely well not to put the ball in the back of his own net there."
36',action,"Alvarez spreads the ball wide to Lillo on the right-hand touchline and the full-back swings in a cross towards Cop, but the ball is too deep for the striker and Casilla claims it easily high above his head. Sporting are pressing extremely high and working really hard at the minute though to prevent Madrid having too much time on the ball."
34',yellow-card,Yellow Card Sergio Álvarez Díaz. Sergio Alvarez is shown the first yellow card of the game for pulling back Asensio after the forward had skipped away from him with a smart turn.
32',action,"Madrid have certainly looked the more comfortable of the two sides in possession, but Sporting still look a threat going forward, particularly down the left-hand side through Gomez and Isma Lopez."
30',action,"Nearly a disaster at the back for Madrid as Nacho’s backpass towards Casilla is far too weak and Carmona looks to get on the end of it, but fortunately for Nacho his keeper is alert to the danger and rushes quickly off his line to make a good sliding tackle on the Sporting midfielder."
29',action,"Disallowed goal!! Isco plays a neat disguised pass into Vasquez inside the penalty box and the winger rolls the ball across to Morata who taps it into an empty net, but the flag is up for offside against Vasquez, with replays showing it to be the correct decision."
27',action,"Chance!! Another chance for Madrid as Vasquez once again gets close to the byline on the right-hand side and crosses towards Morata at the back post, but he can’t quite get over the ball and can only balloon his header high over the bar."
25',action,"Coentrao is absolutely furious with the referee as he waves play on despite the ball appearing to go out for a Madrid corner by a good few inches, and Cop then wins a free-kick close to halfway with some good hold-up play, drawing the foul from Nacho."
23',action,"Madrid are causing Sporting several problems down the right-hand side at the moment as Kovacic slides a lovely through ball into the path of Danilo who’s made a good overlapping run, but the right-back’s cut-back is behind Morata and Sporting are able to clear the danger."
21',action,Mateo Kovacic is brought down by Carmona with what is a pretty clumsy challenge in the end. Kovacic could himself a little lucky there though as he let the ball get away from him slightly and the counter attack was very much on had Carmona stolen the ball away legally.
19',action,This game is extremely open at the moment as Vesga is only prevented from breaking into the penalty box by an outstretched leg of Nacho.
17',goal,Goal Francisco Román Alarcón Suárez. GOOOOAAAAALLLLLL!!!! WHAT A GOAL FROM ISCO!!!! The midfielder draws Madrid level as he shows some wonderful footwork to skip away from three Sporting defenders inside the area before curling a left-footed shot into the top corner from 12 yards out.
17',assist,"Assist Lucas Vázquez Iglesias. Vázquez played the pass into Isco, but that goal was all about some individual brilliance from the Spaniard."
14',assist,Assist Mikel Vesga Arruti. The pass was an exquisite one from Vesga and the finish was just as good from Cop.
14',goal,"Goal Duje Čop. GOOOOAAAAAALLLLLLL!!!! Cop gives Sporting the lead!! Mikel Vesga plays a delightful, chipped pass over the top of the Madrid defence into the penalty box and Cop watches it drop over his shoulder before hitting a low first-time volley past Kiko Casilla and into the back of the net."
11',action,"CHANCE! A huge chance for Vasquez as Danilo picks him out seven yards out from goal with a lovely cross from the right, but despite being completely unmarked the winger can only head the ball over the bar."
10',action,"James Rodriguez whips in a cross from a free-kick on the left-hand side which evades several players at the near post and goes all the way through to Sergio Ramos in the middle, but the ball is just behind the Madrid captain and he can only turn it towards goal with very little power."
8',action,"Close!! Sporting come close to opening the scoring as Gomez gets in behind the Madrid defence down the left-hand edge of the penalty box and stands up a cross towards Duje Cop at the back post, and the striker nods the ball back towards Carlos Carmona who looks to be about to put the ball into the back of the net from six yards out, but Nacho sticks a leg in to turn the ball over the bar."
6',action,"Madrid break forward at pace down the right-hand touchline through Lucas Vasquez who gets to the byline before skipping past a couple of Sporting defenders with ease, but his chipped cross is well headed clear by Jean-Sylvain Babin with Alvaro Morata waiting in the middle."
4',action,"Sporting get their first chance to get forward down the right-hand side now as Lillo Castellano links up well with Moi Gomes just inside the Madrid half, but the Madrid midfield do well to crowd Lillo out and regain possession."
2',action,"Real Madrid are seeing plenty of the ball already and get an early chance to get the ball into the penalty box as Fabio Coentrao has space to cross from the left-hand side, but the cross is far too deep and Sporting are able to bring the ball away with ease."
1',action,Kick-off! Madrid get the game underway.
,action,"The players are making their way through the tunnel and out onto the pitch, led by referee David Fernandez. Kick-off is not far away now."
,action,"Zinedine Zidane meanwhile has opted to rest a whole host of his big names, with Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema all left out completely and Toni Kroos and Luca Modric only on the bench. That does though mean an opportunity for a number of fringe players, including James Rodriguez and Isco in midfield, both of whom will be eager to put in a good performance having failed to hold down a regular spot in the starting line-up so far this season."
,action,"Sporting look as though they are going to go with a five man defence, with Jean-Sylvain Babin slotting in alongside Jorge Mere and Fernando Amorebieta at the back and Duje Cop leading the line as the lone striker."
,action,"Subs: Ruben Yanez, Kroos, Marcelo, Casemiro, Mariano, Modric, Tejero"
,action,"Madrid (4-3-3): Casilla; Danilo, Nacho, Ramos, Coentrao; Isco, Kovacic, James; Vasquez, Morata, Asensio"
,action,"Subs: Marino, Castro, Cases, Canella, Afif, Ndi, Torres"
,action,"Teams: Sporting (5-4-1): Cuellar; Castellano, Mere, Babin, Amorebieta, Lopez; Carmona, Alvarez, Vesga, Moi Gomez; Cop"
,action,"Ronaldo also scored twice when Madrid faced Sporting at the Santiago Bernabeu earlier in the season, with Carlos Carmona’s goal proving to be a mere consolation as Zinedine Zidane’s side ran out 2-1 winners."
,action,"They come into the game full of confidence too having come from behind to beat Bayern Munich in their Champions League quarter-final first leg tie in midweek, with a brace of goals from Cristiano Ronaldo securing a 2-1 win."
,action,"Madrid meanwhile have a three point lead over Barcelona at the top of the table, and are unbeaten in their last eight league fixtures, including a 1-1 draw with Atletico Madrid in their last league outing."
,action,"Four of their five league wins this season have come at home though, although two of those have been against the two sides who are currently below them in the table, Granada and Osasuna."
,action,"Sporting are in a dreadful run of form having won just once in their last nine league matches, and currently sit 18th in the table, five points adrift of safety."
