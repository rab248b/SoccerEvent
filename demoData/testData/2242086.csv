,action,"Spurs close the gap back to four points on leaders Chelsea with a comfortable 4-0 win over Bournemouth. Mousa Dembele and Son Heung-min gave them a 2-0 lead at half-time and Harry Kane added a third just moments after the break, before Vincent Janssen came off the bench to score his first league goal from open play in stoppage time, to keep the title race very much alive. That’s all from us for today, thanks for joining us and we hope you can join us again soon."
,action,Full-time: Tottenham Hotspur 4-0 Bournemouth
90'+2',goal,"Goal Vincent Janssen. GOOOOOAAAAAAALLLLL!!!! Janssen finally gets his first Premier League goal from open play to make it four!! Davies picks out the substitute at the near post with a low cross from the left, and although his first shot is blocked by Boruc, he keeps his cool to slot home the rebound from seven yards out."
90'+1',action,There’ll be three minutes of added time at the end of this game.
89',action,"Despite being 3-0 up Spurs are still putting pressure on Bournemouth, not allowing them any time on the ball which will really please Mauricio Pochettino, who has been barking instructions from the touchline throughout this game."
87',substitution,Substitution sub-out Christian Dannemann Eriksen sub-in Vincent Janssen . Spurs are making their final change now with sub-in Vincent Janssen coming on to replace Eriksen.
85',action,"Another opening for Spurs as Dembele plays a long first-time ball into the path of Sissoko who appears to be clean through on goal down the right-hand edge of the penalty area, but having cut inside onto his left foot, the Frenchman opts not to shoot and wastes too long giving the pass to Eriksen, allowing the Bournemouth defence to get back and clear the danger."
84',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Bamidele Alli sub-in Moussa Sissoko . Another change for Spurs and other standing ovation, this time for Alli as he makes his way over towards the touchline to be replaced by sub-in Moussa Sissoko."
83',action,"Fraser and Daniels break away down the left-hand touchline and Fraser does well to work the ball into the path of Daniels who has space to shoot from a tight angle 10 yards out from goal, but he snatches at the chance and fires the ball across goal and out for a throw-in on the far side."
81',action,"Spurs are still looking extremely dangerous and come close to adding a fourth as Son gets in behind the Bournemouth defence down the left-hand side of the penalty area and looks to get a shot away towards goal, but Daniels recovers well to stick out a leg and divert the shot into the side netting."
79',substitution,Substitution sub-out Harry Kane sub-in Victor Wanyama . And now Spurs are making their first change as Kane goes off to a standing ovation from the home crowd with sub-in Victor Wanyama coming on in his place.
77',substitution,Substitution sub-out Benik Afobe sub-in Lys Mousset . A third and final change for Bournemouth now as sub-in Lys Mousset comes on to replace Afobe.
75',action,"Boruc is called into action down to his left once again, this time to keep out Davies’s low, dipping effort from 30 yards out. The Polish keeper did well to hang on to that as it did look as though it dipped just in front of him."
74',action,"Bournemouth finally have a shot on target as Arter drives a powerful left-footed effort towards goal from 25 yards out. The ball is straight at Hugo Lloris who catches it with ease, but the shot does draw ironic cheers from the home fans."
72',action,"Chance!!! Walker clips a lovely cross towards Alli who’s arriving late into the penalty area, but the midfielder can’t make clean contact with his attempted first-time volley under pressure from Smith, and although the ball breaks to Son seven yards out from goal the linesman’s flag goes up for offside, which may be a relief for Son as who drags the shot horribly wide."
70',yellow-card,Yellow Card Ryan Fraser. Fraser’s first action is a late lunge on Davies which earns him a yellow card.
69',action,"Another half-chance for Spurs as Son hits a first-time volley towards goal from a tight angle on the left after a poor clearing header from Cook, but once again it’s easy enough  for Boruc."
69',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Junior Stanislas sub-in Ryan Fraser . Bournemouth are making a second change now in an attempt to find a way back into this game, with sub-in Ryan Fraser coming on to replace Stanislas."
68',action,"Eriksen swings in another wonderful cross from a free-kick on the left after a foul on Alli by Arter, but Cook just about gets to the ball to head away with Kane and Dier both lurking in a dangerous area."
66',action,"Save!! Boruc is forced into another save low to his left as Eriksen turns sharply on the edge of the area and hits a dipping effort towards the bottom corner, before Son fires a fierce effort straight into the face of Daniels just moments later."
64',action,"Eriksen whips in another Spurs corner after Cook had blocked Kane’s shot on the turn. Afobe heads the ball clear but Tottenham regain possession almost immediately, rather epitomising Bournemouth’s problems at the minute as they really are being penned into their own half."
62',action,"Lovely play once again from Spurs as Kane plays a one-two with Son which sets him away into space just outside the Bournemouth penalty area, but he tries to curl the ball into the corner rather than go for power with the shot and doesn’t catch it cleanly, making it easy enough for Boruc to deal with."
60',action,"Alli is brought down by Stanislas 25 yards out from goal on the left-hand side presenting Eriksen with a chance to go for goal from the free-kick, but he strikes it straight into the wall and Bournemouth are able to hack the ball clear."
58',action,"Alli spreads the ball across the field to Walker in space on the right and the full-back links up well with Eriksen initially, but his control then lets him down and Bournemouth, who are really struggling to get out of their own half at the moment, will have the throw and a chance for momentary rest-bite."
56',substitution,Substitution sub-out Jack Wilshere sub-in Lewis Cook . The on-loan Arsenal midfielder isn’t going to be able to continue and sub-in Lewis Cook comes on in his place.
54',action,"Another half-chance for Kane as the ball breaks to him 10 yards out to the left of the goal, but once again he can only strike straight at Boruc, although he was off balance as he took the shot on. Wilshere is now down having received a knock trying to block the shot which has drawn a huge cheer from the home fans."
52',action,"CHANCE!! A huge chance for Kane to get his second as Cook gives the ball away cheaply to Eriksen 25 yards out from goal, and the midfielder plays a neat reverse pass into Kane who just has Boruc to beat 18 yards out from goal, but he can only fire his low effort straight at the Bournemouth keeper."
50',action,"Conceding such an early goal in this second half is exactly what Eddie Howe would have been hoping to avoid, and the way this game has gone so far it could well put this game beyond Bournemouth's reach."
48',goal,"Goal Harry Kane. GOOOOAAAALLLLLL!!! Kane makes it three!! Alli plays delicate cross into Kane’s feet from the right-hand side and the striker turns Francis with ease before slotting a low, left-footed shot into the bottom corner from six yards out to score his 20th league goal of the season."
46',action,Kick-off! Arter gets the second half underway for Bournemouth.
,action,"Mauricio Pochettino will be asking for more of the same in the second half from his side and another goal would surely put the game out of Bournemouth’s reach. Bournemouth meanwhile have struggled to retain possession for any length of time when they have won it back and haven’t created any meaningful chances, and Eddie Howe may not waste too much time in making a couple of changes early in the second half, with the creativity of Ryan Fraser and Max Gradel available on the bench."
,action,"Spurs are in full control at White Hart Lane thanks to two goals in three minutes from Dembele and Son. Bournemouth had a brief spell shortly after conceding the second where they looked as they might be able to find a way back into this game, but Tottenham soon regained control and could have extended their lead with Eriksen and Son both passing up opportunities."
,action,Half-time: Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 Bournemouth
45'+1',action,We’re into two minutes of added time at the end of the first half.
45',action,Smith is back on his feet but is certainly hobbling and Tottenham may well try and expose him down the left-hand side in the last couple of minutes of this first half.
43',action,Smith has gone down after landing awkwardly while trying to jump for the ball up against Alli. He looks in some discomfort but Eddie Howe will be pretty keen to get him through to half-time at least.
41',action,"Another chance for Spurs and this time Eriksen creates it for Son in very similar circumstances to the chance moments ago, as he picks out Son with a low cross from the left-hand side but he can only drill a low left-footed effort straight at Boruc from just inside the penalty box."
39',action,"Chance!! Another chance for Eriksen as Son controls Davies’s low cross inside the left-hand edge of the Bournemouth penalty area before playing the ball into a dangerous area 10 yards out from goal where Eriksen arrives late and hits it first time, but he fires the ball narrowly over the bar."
37',action,"Save!! Wonderful football from Spurs as Alderweireld plays a crisp pass into Kane’s feet on the edge of the Bournemouth penalty area and the England striker flicks the ball into Eriksen’s path with a delicate first-time touch, but the Dane’s low 18-yard shot is kept out by Boruc low to his left."
35',action,"Alli spreads the ball wide to Walker in space on the right-hand touchline, but the full-back tries to take on Daniels and Wilshere himself rather than cross towards Kane in the middle, but he's well tackled by Wilshere who brings the ball away from danger."
33',action,"Mauricio Pochettino is patrolling the edge of his technical area shouting at his players, trying to make sure they continue to press high and deny Bournemouth any time on the ball."
31',action,"Spurs seem to have weathered that very brief spell of pressure from Bournemouth and are back in possession with Alderweireld and Vertonghen at the back, but that possession is surrendered as Walker is flagged for offside having been picked out by a wonderful cross-field pass from Alderweireld."
29',action,"Dele Alli’s name is sung out around White Hart Lane for the first time today, but it doesn’t seem to help the young midfielder as he immediately misplaces a pass straight out of play for a throw-in."
27',action,"Close!! This is turning into a good little spell for Bournemouth now as Junior Stanislas whips in a delightful low cross across the face of goal from the right-hand side, but it’s just out of the reach of Afobe who’s sliding in at the back post."
25',action,Eddie Howe will be relatively pleased with the way his side have responded to that second goal as Harry Arter is brought to ground by Dembele inside the Spurs half. It looks as though referee Michael Oliver is going to let the midfielder off with just a warning though.
23',action,"Bournemouth have a free-kick 35 yards out from goal which Wilshire floats in towards Steve Cook just inside the penalty box, but Vertonghen gets up well to head the ball clear. Cook then has another opportunity from a corner moments later but can only head over the bar from eight yards out."
21',action,"Bournemouth still seemed to be annoyed at the decision to award Spurs the corner for the first goal when they conceded the second, but they face an uphill battle now as they’ve really struggled to get into this game at all."
19',assist,"Assist Harry Kane. Kane could have turned and gone for goal himself, but chose to feed his teammate instead with a clever flick."
19',goal,"Goal Heung-Min Son. GOOOOAAAALLLLLL!!!! Heung-min Son doubles the lead!!! Wilshere’s attempted pass forward is blocked into the path of Kane who flicks the ball on to Son, and the winger shows a quick burst of pace to get away from Francis and into the right-hand side of the Bournemouth penalty area, before sliding the ball through the legs of Boruc from a tight angle."
16',assist,Assist Christian Dannemann Eriksen. It wasn’t a particularly good corner in truth from Eriksen but it somehow found its way all the way through to Dembele.
16',goal,"Goal Moussa Sidi Yaya Dembélé. GOOOOOOAAAAALLLLLLL!!!!! Eriksen puts in a low corner from the left-hand side towards Alderweireld at the near post, but the ball evades everyone before falling at the feet of Dembele at the back post, and the Belgian midfielder smashes it into the bottom corner from eight yards out."
13',action,"Save!! Kyle Walker drives towards the right-hand corner of the penalty box before laying the ball into the path of Mousa Dembele who hits a ferocious effort towards goal from 25 yards out, but Boruc gets down quickly at his near post to make a relatively routine save."
12',action,Tottenham are looking extremely comfortable in possession at the minute but they are having to be extremely patient as they look to break down this Bournemouth defence.
10',action,"For the first time in the game Bournemouth venture into the Spurs half in numbers and Wilshere, who is greeted by a loud chorus of boos from the home fans, tries to thread a pass into Afobe’s feet inside the box, but Jan Vertonghen reads it well and intercepts the pass."
8',action,"Benik Afobe controls the ball on his chest and flicks it infield towards Josh King just inside his own half, but the ball had gone out of play so Spurs will have the throw-in. King and Afobe are having to sit pretty deep at the moment though which is meaning Bournemouth have no real outlet when they do have possession."
6',action,"Save! Eriksen whips in another low cross from the right-hand side and Kane gets on the end of it six yards out from goal, but he can’t get a clean connection on the ball and Artur Boruc is able to keep it out, although the flag does go up so the goal wouldn’t have counted."
5',action,"Tottenham work the ball forward into the Bournemouth penalty box for the first time as Toby Alderweireld’s long ball forward is headed clear by Charlie Daniels but only as far as Harry Kane, but his first time volley is blocked well by Simon Francis, who has to be alert from the resultant corner to block Christian Eriksen’s low cross."
3',action,A relatively quiet start to the game from both sides with Tottenham enjoying the majority of possession. Bournemouth look pretty compact without the ball though.
1',action,Kick-off! Referee Michael Oliver blows his whistle and Spurs get the game underway.
,action,"The players are making their way out onto the pitch, kick-off is now just moments away."
,action,"The match ended goalless when the two sides met at the Vitality Stadium earlier in the season, however the two meetings between the sides last season produced a total of nine goals, eight of which were scored by Spurs."
,action,"Bournemouth make just one change from their defeat to Chelsea, with Junior Stanislas replacing Ryan Fraser on the right-hand side of midfield having recovered from a groin strain, while Tyrone Mings is included on the bench having served a five match ban for stamping on Zlatan Ibrahimovic."
,action,"Mauricio Pochettino has made two changes from the side that beat Watford, including a return to the starting line-up for top scorer Harry Kane, who replaces Vincent Janssen having come off the bench against Watford. The other change comes at right-back with Kyle Walker replacing Kieran Trippier."
,action,"Subs: Allsop, Mings, Cargill, Cook, Fraser, Gradel, Mousset"
,action,"Bournemouth (4-4-2): Boruc; Smith, Francis, Cook, Daniels; Stanislas, Arter, Wilshere, Pugh; King, Afobe."

,action,"Teams: Spurs (4-2-3-1): Lloris; Walker, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Davies; Dier, Dembele; Eriksen, Alli, Son; Kane"
,action,"They are though seven points clear of the relegation zone, and one more win would take them up to the coveted 38 point mark which is often enough to ensure Premier League survival."
,action,"Bournemouth in contrast are without a win in their last three league matches, and have only won twice away from home all season."
,action,"They do though have a five point cushion over third placed Liverpool, and come into the game on the back of a convincing 4-0 win over Watford last time out, their 11th consecutive Premier League win at White hart Lane."
,action,"Tottenham currently sit second in the Premier League table and are unbeaten at in home in the league this season, but they are still seven points adrift of leaders Chelsea."
