,action,"It’s all over at the Veltins-Arena and Dortmund have been held to a 1-1 draw by Schalke in the Revierderby. Aubameyang gave the visitors the lead midway through the second half and Dembele came close to doubling their advantage as he rattled the foot of the post, but Schalke responded well and equalised through Kehrer’s first ever senior goal, but neither side were able to force a late winner. That’s all from us for today, thanks for joining us and we hope you can join us again soon."
,action,Full-time! Schalke 1-1 Borussia Dortmund
90'+2',action,"Huge appeals for a penalty for Schalke as the ball appears the bounce up and hit Bartra on the arm, but referee Felix Zwayer waives away the claims which doesn’t go down too well with Markus Weinzierl, who is sent to the stands for his reaction."
90'+1',yellow-card,Yellow Card Nabil Bentaleb. Bentaleb has also been booked for pushing Sokratis following that foul.
90'+1',yellow-card,Yellow Card Sokratis Papastathopoulos. Sokratis has been booked for the foul.
90'+1',action,"We’re into three minutes if added time now with both sides looking extremely dangerous going forward. First Dembele has a good chance for Dortmund but completely misses the ball under pressure from Howedes six yards out from goal, before Goretzka is brought down by Sokratis as he looks to break forward for Schalke"
89',action,"A half-chance for Schalke as Goretzka breaks forward with Huntelaar ahead of him, but the midfielder’s pass is just too heavy for the Dutchman who would’ve been clean through on goal had he controlled it!"
87',substitution,Substitution sub-out Shinji Kagawa sub-in Christian Pulisic . Another change for Dortmund too now with sub-in Christian Pulisic replacing Kagawa.
87',action,"Dembele and Mor are still looking a threat to Schalke, this time it’s Dembele who picks out Mor on the right-hand edge of the penalty box but Kehrer gets out well to block the cross, allowing Fahrmann to comfortably gather it in."
85',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Guido Burgstaller sub-in Klaas-Jan Huntelaar . Schalke are making a third and final change now as they look for a late winner, with sub-in Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who scored against Dortmund in both the home and away fixtures last season, coming on in place of Burgstaller."
83',action,"Mor does superbly well to skip away from several Schalke players on the right-hand touchline before driving infield and spreading the ball wide to Dembele in space on the left, but the winger’s cross is initially blocked before bouncing back off him and out for a goal kick."
81',action,That goa has brought the Veltins-Arena to life with the home fans on their feet and getting right behind their side now. They certainly believe they can go on and win this game.
79',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Marcel Schmelzer sub-in Emre Mor . Schmelzer’s absence may well have cost Dortmund there and he’s not going to be able to return to the field, with sub-in Emre Mor coming on in his place."
77',assist,Assist Leon Goretzka. Goretzka appeared to be going nowhere but played a neat back-heel straight into the left-back's path.
77',goal,"Goal Thilo Kehrer. GOOOOAAALLLLL!!!!!!!!! Kehrer brings Schalke level!! Goretzka lays the ball off into the left-back’s path with a clever back-heel inside the box, and he drills a powerful low effort past Burki and into the near corner!"
76',action,Schmelzer is down receiving treatment for what looks to be a back injury and Dortmund are forced to defend with 10 men.
74',action,OFF THE POST!! Dembele drives into the Schalke penalty box down the left-hand side before opening his body up and curling a low shot against the base of the post from 12 yards out. That may well have sealed the win had it gone in.
73',substitution,Substitution sub-out Felix Passlack sub-in Raphaël Adelino José Guerreiro . A first change for Dortmund now as Passlack is replaced by Raphaël Guerreiro.
72',action,"Goretzka is penalised for a clash with Castro in the middle of the field and the ball is worked short to Passlack on the right-hand side from the free-kick, but the wing-back’s cross just evades Kagawa inside the penalty box before Aubameyang's chip from the left-hand side evades both the far post and an unmarked Kagawa who had stayed forward."
70',substitution,Substitution sub-out Benjamin Stambouli sub-in Max Meyer . And it's going to be a double change in fact as Stambouli is replaced by sub-in Max Meyer. It looks as though they are switching to a more attacking 4-3-3 formation too.
70',substitution,Substitution sub-out Jorge Andújar Moreno sub-in Alessandro Schöpf . A first change for Schalke now as sub-in Alessandro Schöpf replaces Coke.
68',action,"One of two signs of frustration starting to creep in for Schalke as they take a corner short only to give possession away cheaply, which is greeted with a few murmurs of discontent from a small contingent of the home fans."
66',action,"Kagawa spreads the ball wide to the left-hand side where Schmelzer collects it in space close to the by-line and he rolls it back to Dembele on the edge of the penalty box, but his chipped cross is a poor one and Stambouli gets back and hooks the ball clear."
64',action,"Markus Weinzierl will be pleased with the way his side have played since falling behind but a set piece looks as though it may well be their best chance of getting back into this game, as they are struggling to create anything meaningful in open play."
62',action,Aubameyang gets in behind the Schalke defence once again but this time the flag goes up against him for offside. You sense that the more open this game becomes the more it will suit the visitors with the pace they have in Aubameyang and Dembele.
60',action,"This game has all of a sudden opened up completely, with Schalke enjoying a good spell of possession and pressing forward in numbers for the first time in this half, but Coke’s cross is blocked and the danger passes for Dortmund on this occassion."
58',action,"CHANCE!!! A huge chance for Aubameyang as Kagawa splits the defence with a wonderfully weighted pass for the striker to get on the end of, but he tries to repeat Kagawa’s trick from moments ago and roll the ball across to a teammate instead of going for goal himself, but the Schalke defence get back to clear the ball away before it reaches an unmarked Dembele."
57',action,"SAVE!! Superb response from Schalke as Howedes rises highest to meet Caligiuri’s corner at pace and directs a powerful header towards goal from six yards out, but it’s straight at Burki who reacts extremely well to parry the ball away above his head."
54',yellow-card,Yellow Card Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Aubameyang is shown a yellow card for his celebration.
53',assist,Assist Shinji Kagawa. Kagawa could easily have gone for a goal himself but instead chose to set up Aubameyang for his 24th league goal of the season.
53',goal,"Goal Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. GOOOOOAAAAALLLLL!!! Aubameyang gives Dortmund the lead!! Moments after Burgstaller had wasted a golden opportunity from six yards out at one end, Dortmund break forward at the other as Dembele plays a lovely ball through the defence into the path of Kagawa, who unselfishly rolls the ball across the penalty box to the striker who taps the ball into an empty net from 12 yards out."
50',action,"Stambouli is very nearly caught in possession on the edge of his own box by Dembele but he manages to squeeze it back to his goalkeeper, before Coke breaks away down the right-hand touchline for Schalke, but having rolled the ball back to Goretzka to cross, the move breaks down as Burgstaller is flagged offside in the middle."
48',action,"Dortmund have started this second half in a similar manner to which they finished the first, seeing plenty of the ball, but it does look as though Schalke may have switched things around in midfield and are looking to press much higher up."
46',action,"A bright start to the second half for Dortmund as Weigl wins possession inside his own half before playing the ball in to Kagawa close to halfway, but his long ball forward with the outside of his boot is too heavy for Aubameyang and Fahrmann can easily gather it in."
46',action,Kick-off! Schalke get the second half underway.
,action,"Schalke started brightly and looked a threat on the break in the early stages, but Markus Weinzierl will be keen for his midfielders to get up in support of lone striker Burgstaller more often in the second half, as well as preventing Dortmund from dominating possession as they did in the last 15 minutes of the first period."
,action,"No goals in the first half but certainly plenty of noise coming from both sets of fans. Dembele has had a couple of good opportunities for Dortmund and Aubameyang has tested Fahrmann with one good effort too, but Thomas Tuchel’s side haven’t created a huge amount of chances, although they did start to control the game in the latter stages of the half."
,action,Half-time: Schalke 0-0 Borussia Dortmund
44',action,"Despite the fact they’re starting to assert their dominance in this game, Dortmund look as though they’re quite happy to go into the break with the score as it is as they knock the ball around at the back."
42',action,"Close! Aubameyang picks up the ball in space 25 yards out from goal and decides to shoot himself, but the effort is deflected narrowly wide and out for a corner, which is half cleared before Bartra is penalised for offside in the next passage of play. Schalke certainly won’t want to give the league’s top scorer that sort of space too often."
40',action,"Schalke are struggling to create anything meaningful at the moment, with very little support for Burgstaller as the lone striker whenever they do have possession."
38',action,"Goretzka gets up well to head away a corner from the left-hand side but he only heads it as far as Passlack who is unmarked as the ball falls to him 35 yards out from goal, but instead of taking his time and looking to pick out a teammate the wing-back goes for goal himself and fires it comfortably wide."
36',action,The intensity of this game has just dropped a little in the last 10 minutes or so which looks to be suiting Dortmund as they’re starting to take control of possession.
34',action,"Save!! Aubameyang has his first chance to show his pace as he breaks away down the right-hand edge of the Schalke penalty box and gets a good low shot away, but Fahrmann makes himself big and blocks the shot well with his legs."
32',action,"Dembele is looking dangerous every time he gets on the ball at the moment, this time skipping away from Caligiuri who cynically pulls him back giving Dortmund a free-kick 35-yards out from goal, but Aubameyang drills it straight into the wall."
30',action,"Close!! The ball falls at Dembele’s feet on the left-hand corner of the penalty box, and although his initial effort is well blocked by a sprawling Coke, the ball bounces back to the winger who curls an effort inches wide of the right-hand post with Fahrmann well beaten."
28',action,"There are a few whistles starting to ring out around the ground from the home fans now as Dortmund knock the ball about, but the home fans will be pretty pleased with they way their side have started."
26',action,"Close!! Schalke are awarded a free-kick on the left-hand side of the penalty box after a foul by Kagawa on Eric Choupo-Moting, and Caligiuri whips in a superb ball which evades everyone and drifts narrowly wide of the far post, with Burki scrambling frantically across his goal."
23',action,"The Dortmund fans are desperately trying to get behind their side, who at the moment look the more comfortable of the two sides in possession, but Schalke look extremely dangerous on the counter-attack."
21',action,"Chance!!! Aubameyang plays a neat ball into the box for Dembele to chase, but Ralf Fahrmann comes off his line extremely quickly to smother the winger’s shot on the edge of the six yard box before the ball falls at the feet of Shinji Kagawa, but he opts against shooting first time despite having what appears to be an almost empty net in front of him, and is eventually forced wide and the opportunity passes."
19',action,"Burgstaller is causing Dortmund a few problems at the moment, this time peeling away down the left-hand touchline and putting in a low cross towards Goretzka in the middle, but the midfielder really needed to make a run across the near post to get on the end of it as Dortmund are easily able to clear."
17',action,"Daniel Caligiuri does well to skip away from a couple of Dortmund defenders on halfway before looking to play the ball in behind the defence for Burgstaller to chase, but the striker isn’t on the same wavelength as his teammate and had dropped off in towards the halfway line, leaving Bartra to regain possession unopposed."
15',action,Passlack looks to get on the end of another long ball down the right-hand side but this time there’s too much pace on it and he can only watch it roll out for a goal-kick. The right wing-back is certainly looking to get forward at every opportunity though.
13',action,Both sets of fans are certainly getting behind their sides at the moment with every tackle being greeted with a loud cheer. There has certainly been no shortage of firm tackles early on either.
11',action,"Schalke win a free-kick 35 yards out from goal and Leon Goretzka goes for goal, but he can only fire wide of the left-hand upright. It was probably a little far out to ever really cause a threat to Roman Burki in the Dortmund goal."
9',action,"Matija Nastasic plays a long ball over the top for Burgstaller to chase and the forward appears to be clean through on goal having got on the end of it, but the linesman’s flag goes up to deny him, although replays show him to be just about level."
7',action,"Dortmund are just starting to get control of the game now as they enjoy a good spell of possession in midfield before spreading the ball wide to Felix Passlack on the right-hand edge of the box, but he attempts a first-time cross towards Aubameyang in the middle and slices it straight out for a goal-kick."
5',action,"This game has started at a really high intensity as Schalke this time have a sight of goal as Guido Burgstaller gets the ball in space 12 yards out after Lukasz Pisczek had given the ball away cheaply, but Dortmund get enough men behind the ball to block the shot and it deflects behind for a corner, which comes to nothing."
3',action,"An early chance for Dortmund as Ousmane Dembele breaks forward down the left-hand touchline and gets in behind Coke before driving in towards the edge of the six yards box, but he can’t quite squeeze the ball across to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who is unmarked at the far post."
1',action,Kick-off! The game is underway with both sets of fans certainly making themselves heard already.
,action,"The players are making their way through the tunnel and out onto the pitch, kick-off is not far away now."
,action,"The game ended goalless when the two sides met earlier in the season, and Schalke will be looking to overturn a poor recent record in the Revierderby, having won just once in the last seven matches between the two sides."
,action,"Dortmund also make four changes to their side which beat Ingolstadt, with Marc Bartra, Julian Weigl, Ousmane Dembele and Felix Passlack all coming into the side. Matthias Ginter, Erik Durm, Raphael Guerreiro and Christian Pulisic are the men who make way."
,action,"Schalke manager Markus Weinzierl makes four changes to the side that started against Mainz, as Holger Badstuber, Max Meyer and Alessandro Schopf drop out of the side, along with the goal scorer from that game Sead Kolasinac, who picked up a muscle injury on international duty. Coke, Matija Nastasic, Nabil Bentaleb and Daniel Caligiuri all come into the side."

,action,"Dortmund also won by a single goal in their last outing prior to the international window, a 1-0 win over Ingolstadt, with top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s 23rd league goal of the season enough to secure all three points for Thomas Tuchel’s side."
,action,"Schalke currently sit ninth in the league table, and come into the game on the back of a 1-0 win at Mainz a fortnight ago, their ninth Bundesliga win of the season."
