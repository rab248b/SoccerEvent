,action,"FULL-TIME! Malaga beat Barcelona by a 2-0 scoreline, putting a huge dent in Luis Enrique's side's hopes of winning the LaLiga title! Goals from Sandro and Jony wrapped up the upset, either side of a red card for Neymar in the second half. The favourites just didn't quite show up, with a mistake from Mathieu proving costly. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+3',action,"Kameni is happy to take his time over everything now, with Mascherano then giving away a free-kick for a foul on Charles. Barcelona just don't appear to have a way back into this game, the second goal has deflated them. Alcacer is picked out on the right flank, but is quickly mobbed and dispossessed."
90'+1',action,There are four minutes of stoppage time. It is party time at La Rosaleda!
90',assist,"Assist Pablo Fornals Malla ; Fornals is fed into the penalty area and faced up by Ter Stegen. He isn't rushed, however, and tucks a pass back to Jony, who finds the back of the net."
90',goal,"Goal Jonathan Rodríguez Menéndez ; GOOOOOOOOAL! JONY MAKES IT 2-0! BARCELONA DROP THREE POINTS! Real Madrid's draw now means nothing. Malaga race forward on the break, with Fornals cutting back an unselfish pass to Jony after racing into the penalty area. Ter Stegen is in no man's land and that's game over. The ex-Sporting winger makes no mistake and slams home!"
89',action,"Suarez is fed in behind the Malaga back four beautifully by Mascherano, but the Uruguayan striker can only rush a shot and find Kameni with it! That was a golden opportunity to get back on level terms. Barcelona are desperately trying to keep the pressure up, but they're leaving themselves open at the back."
87',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Javier Alejandro Mascherano ; Mascherano takes a terrible touch while trying to clear some danger in his own half, and is forced to foul Charles to prevent the substitute from getting in behind. He gets a booking. That pretty much sums up Barcelona's night."
85',action,"The home fans are making plenty of noise, urging their players over the finish line. Malaga have been very combative in the midfield battle and have got their intensity just right, setting themselves up for a brilliant result against top opposition. This will be a real feather in Michel's cap."
83',substitution,"; Busquets is picked out at the back post by a cross from the left, but the Spain international can't rise high enough to head an effort goalwards. Juankar is replaced by Jony for the last five minutes or so."
82',yellow-card,Yellow Card Juan Carlos Pérez López ; Juankar is the latest Malaga player to go into the book for a cynical tackle around 35 yards out from goal.
82',action,"We're well into the last 10 minutes in Andalucia now, with Barcelona rapidly looking as though they're going to lose out with 10 men to Malaga. After Real Madrid's draw earlier, it would make this result all the more sour. The visitors continue to win plenty of free-kicks, but Michel's side are defending them well."
80',action,"Messi hammers the resulting free-kick into the wall, with Malaga countering brilliantly. They escape down the left and then switch the play out to Charles on the right-hand side. The Brazilian substitutes loses his balance slightly and lines up a shot from a tight angle, which ends up comfortably within Ter Stegen's grasp."
78',action,"The hosts continue to defend quite deep, with essentially a back five. Penaranda is very deep, with Malaga taking an all hands to the pump mentality. Sergi Roberto cuts in from the right and goes down on the very edge of the box, but the referee awards a free-kick! Barcelona's players argue that it was a penalty."
77',substitution,"; Sandro jogs off for the home side, with Sandro introduced for the late stages. Fresh legs up front for Michel's men."
75',action,"Camacho plays Recio into trouble, with Barcelona able to pick the ball up in midfield and put some pressure on. Iniesta tries to stab a low pass into Suarez, but the Uruguay international loses his balance. With around a quarter of an hour left to play at La Rosaleda, the hosts appear to have the measure of Luis Enrique's side. Real Madrid fans will be watching nervously."
73',action,"Mascherano commits a foul on the edge of the penalty area, which gifts Malaga a chance to shoot. Sandro takes aim, but Suarez makes a block in the wall. Barcelona put together an attack, but yet again a good challenge in the centre of midfield denies their progress forward. Michel's men are battling for everything brilliantly."
71',action,"OFFSIDE! Malaga are still keeping a lot of players behind the ball, despite Barcelona going down to 10 men. Alcacer puts in a poor cross from the right and the hosts quickly break. Penaranda is picked out making a run in behind, before dribbling beyond Ter Stegen and firing home a finish off the post - but the linesman had his flag up."
69',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Adalberto Peñaranda Maestre ; Penaranda is the latest man in the referee's book, as the substitute pushes over Umtiti for no reason. A yellow is sufficient."
68',action,"Barcelona are keeping a similar approach to their play, with Messi dropping a little bit deeper to allow for Iniesta and Alba to drift slightly more often out to the left-hand side. Alcacer cuts in from the right, with Camacho putting in a brilliant tackle, but the Malaga midfielder is somehow penalised. That is an awful decision and he can't believe it!"
67',substitution,"; Juanpi takes his leave after wasting a couple of great opportunities for the home side, with Penaranda coming into the game to add fresh legs."
65',yellow-red,"Yellow/Red Neymar da Silva Santos Junior ; RED CARD! Neymar throws himself into a stupid challenge on Diego Llorente, long after the ball had gone. Given his earlier caution, that means he takes an early walk down the tunnel."
65',action,"Over the top from Neymar! Suarez makes a smart run in behind the Malaga defence and forces Kameni to rush out and narrow the angle. He bides his time to angle a cross towards the penalty spot, but the Brazil international can only arrive to nod a poor header over the crossbar with the goalkeeper out of position entirely."
63',action,"Messi breaks into the penalty area and towards the left byline, before cutting back a smart pass to Suarez. The Uruguay international dummies the ball, in an attempt to free up somebody behind him, but Alcacer was nowhere to be seen! Suarez should have just put his foot through it to test Kameni."
61',substitution,"; Paco Alcacer is introduced for the away side, with Andre Gomes taking his leave. Luis Enrique is throwing the kitchen sink at Malaga during the last half an hour."
60',action,"Neymar just hasn't been given the time and space to cause any problems, with the Brazilian forced into areas where Camacho and Fornals can put in timely challenges. Malaga are continually robbing Barcelona of possession in the midfield third and looking to get forward with urgency. Neymar breaks to the left byline with a neat bit of skill, before hammering a shot from a narrow angle into the outside of the near post!"
58',action,"The hosts put together a brilliant break, with Iniesta robbed of possession in midfield. Sandro is picked out on the left, but the Spanish striker angles a square ball out to the opposite flank to Juanpi instead of shooting. Again, the Venezuelan forward rushed his attempt and fires it straight at Ter Stegen, who catches. What a huge opportunity!"
57',action,"Messi takes aim from the periphery of the area, but the Barcelona star can only drag a shot wide of the near post. Kameni has at least been a little worried in the last few minutes, but the visitors need to hit the target and ask some questions of Malaga's goalkeeper. Things have been incredibly easy for Michel's men in comparison to their expectations."
55',action,"Messi is brought down on the edge of the penalty box yet again, after turning his man well. Neymar is the man to stand over the most recent dead-ball situation, but a curling delivery from the Brazilian is headed away from the danger zone by Camacho. Luis Enrique's side aren't even making the most of free-kicks. This is a very lacklustre performance."
53',action,"Barcelona are pushing a lot of players forward, with Luis Enrique clearly wanting his side to show a bit more urgency. Malaga are able to defend well and then counter dangerously, with Mascherano's lack of pace being exploited occasionally. The Blaugrana just can't seem to get out of first gear this evening."
51',action,"Messi is fouled on the edge of the penalty area by Camacho, with the Malaga captain somehow escaping a yellow card once again. The Argentina international takes aim from 25 yards out, but bends the ball hopelessly over the crossbar. Kameni isn't being given much work to do at all."
49',action,"Suarez gives the ball away, allowing for Juanpi to bring possession down the left-hand side for the hosts, but a cut-back from the Venezuela international is mopped up by Sergi Roberto easily. Barcelona definitely haven't settled into this second half seamlessly, there might be a few teething problems before the substitutes settle in."
48',action,"The referee is given a decision to make very early in the second half, as Andre Gomes is penalised for clashing heads with Camacho. Malaga take it quickly and Juankar escapes down the left-hand side and skips beyond Mascherano. He cuts back a cross from the byline, but Umtiti slides in at the near post to make an important block."
46',substitution,"; Mathieu is replaced by Sergi Roberto, with Mascherano pushing into centre-back as a result."
46',substitution,"; Denis takes his leave after a poor first half, with Iniesta taking the captain's armband and coming into the game."
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half in Andalucia! Barcelona need at least two goals to secure themselves a win this evening, with Real Madrid's earlier draw against Atletico surely in the back of their minds."
,action,"HALF-TIME! Malaga head into the dressing room with a 1-0 lead over Barcelona, given to them by ex-Blaugrana striker Sandro. The visitors just haven't created enough to trouble Kameni, with Luis Enrique sure to be thinking of alternatives for the second half. Messi and company have had plenty of the ball, but it has counted for nothing, with the favourites set to drop three important points in the title race if this continues."
45',yellow-card,"Yellow Card José Luis García del Pozo ; Recio gets a yellow card for cynically tugging on the shirt of Messi, as the Argentine forward looked to change gear and cause problems."
45',action,"Sandro is nearly released in behind down the left-hand side, but Umtiti recovers brilliantly to catch the Spanish goalscorer and put the ball out for a corner. It is taken short, with a delivery then unable to beat the first man. A cross is eventually whipped in from deep on the left, but Ter Stegen claims it easily."
43',action,"Malaga continue to keep a lot of players behind the ball in an attempt to frustrate the favourites, and Kameni hasn't had much to do in the first half as a result. Jordi Alba and Neymar appear to be the obvious combination down the left flank for Barcelona, but Sergi Roberto has already been warming up. Luis Enrique may want to change his system at the break."
41',action,"Jordi Alba is found on the overlap on the left for Barcelona, with Juankar able to divert his eventual back-post cross behind for a corner. The resulting set piece is whipped in towards the near post, but Mascherano is penalised for handball. Luis Enrique's men just can't seem to build up a head of steam. Juanpi breaks down the left for the hosts, but blasts high and wide of the target."
39',action,"Messi lifts a great ball over the top for Neymar to chase, but Diego Llorente is able to nod a defensive header behind for a corner. The resulting set piece picks out Mathieu, who tried his luck with an acrobatic volley, with Andre Gomes then only able to follow up with a deflected effort that Kameni claims with ease."
37',yellow-card,Yellow Card Federico Ricca Rostagnol ; Ricca gets a yellow card for diving into a rather poor challenge on Umtiti. He showed a bit too much stud for the referee's liking.
37',action,"Neymar continues to dance infield from the left-hand side, but this time it is Camacho's turn to slide in and put a crunching tackle in on the Brazilian. Malaga just keep funnelling Barcelona's danger men into congested areas of the field where they have a far greater chance of dispossessing them."
35',action,"Suddenly, Malaga are full of confidence, with their home fans making even more noise. They've been solid defensively and capitalised on the one mistake that Barcelona have made here tonight. Michel can't ask for any more from his players, and they've got just 10 minutes to keep the visitors out before the half-time interval."
33',yellow-card,Yellow Card Samuel Umtiti ; Umtiti gets a booking for his complaints in the aftermath of the Sandro goal.
32',assist,Assist Juan Carlos Pérez López ; Juankar plays a hopeful lofted pass forward that turns into a wonderful throughball.
32',goal,"Goal Sandro Ramírez Castillo ; GOOOOOOAL! SANDRO MAKES IT 1-0! The ex-Barcelona striker gets a goal against his former club! The Spanish striker is released in behind the visiting lines after a mistake from Mathieu. The Frenchman tried to play his man offside, but failed, with Sandro then racing into the box and slotting a low finish inside Ter Stegen's near post."
31',action,"Barcelona want a penalty, but the referee isn't interested! Messi turns well and gets beyond Camacho, before sliding a low pass into the area for Andre Gomes to chase. The ex-Benfica midfielder tries to get a toe to the ball to poke a finish goalwards, but Rosales covers across and outmuscles his man. Good decision from the officials."
29',action,"Malaga aren't taking any risks at all, with any passes or loose balls in between the lines being hoofed upfield. The hosts break down the left and manage to whip in a ball through Juankar, but a dangerous delivery from the left winger is hooked to safety by Jordi Alba. Barcelona have certainly been matched so far."
27',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Neymar da Silva Santos Junior ; Neymar is booked for obstructing a free-kick, as the Brazilian deliberately ties his laces in front of the ball to slow things down."
26',action,"Sandro tries to lead a counter for the home side, but Busquets makes a good interception as Juanpi attempts to dart in behind to receive a through ball from the Spaniard. Malaga are competing well and defending comfortably, with Michel sure to be content with what he has seen so far."
24',action,"Ter Stegen is nearly surprised by a long-range attempt, with the German creeping a little out of position, but the ball sails harmlessly high and wide of the target. A little wake-up call for the ex-Gladbach goalkeeper, perhaps. Andre Gomes continues to try and alter the tempo of the game with some darting runs upfield, but the Portuguese midfielder keeps being fouled."
22',action,"Ricca brings down Messi on the edge of the penalty area, mistiming a sliding tackle quite badly in the process. The Argentina international lines it up himself, but can only curl a good effort narrowly high and wide of the top right-hand corner. Barcelona are getting a little closer, at least."
20',action,"The visitors keep attempting to work a man over on either flank, but chances and shots have been kept to a minimum by narrow and congested shape from Malaga. Clearly, the underdogs have a gameplan and want to protect Kameni as best they can. They are creating absolutely nothing, however, with the likes of Fornals and Juanpi barely getting on the ball."
18',action,"Barcelona keep dominating the ball, with Malaga barely getting a touch. The home fans are getting a little bit restless. Whenever Michel's men attempt to get forward on the break, they tend to give it away within a few passes - it hasn't been the most scintilating of starts from an Andalucian perspective."
16',action,"Great save from Kameni! Suarez is picked out in behind the Malaga back four by a wonderful ball over the top from Jordi Alba. He brings it down on his chest in the box, but the hosts' goalkeeper stands up tall to make a brilliant stop as the Barcelona striker tries to finish on the turn. We could be in for some more heroics from the Cameroonian shot-stopper tonight."
15',action,"Juanpi and Sandro combine down the right-hand side for Malaga, but a cross from the latter sails narrowly over a ruck of players at the back post. Suarez does appear to be keen to carry on, despite seeming to have a knock to his ankle, which is bound to be a worrying sight for Luis Enrique. Barcelona continue to manipulate the ball in long spells."
13',action,"Fornals gives the ball away in midfield, with Barcelona quickly looking to break. Andre Gomes is found scampering into the box, but Diego Llorente makes a brilliant tackle. The away side maintain their pressure, with the ball worked out to the right by Messi, but the Uruguay international is adjudged to be offside. He appears to be limping a little."
12',action,"Suarez goes down around 25 yards from goal, claiming for a foul, but the referee isn't interested at all. The hosts are yet to create any chances at all, and are spending their time camped inside their own half. Andre Gomes gives away a free-kick in a deep area, but Malaga take it short, before eventually giving possession away to Alba."
10',action,"Neymar drifts in from the left, jinking inside two players, before Fornals fells the Brazil international with a cynical bodycheck. The ex-Santos winger is already looking dangerous. Kameni has still been comfortable so far, though, claiming two crosses that were sent looping into poor areas of the penalty box."
8',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Jordi Alba Ramos ; Alba gets the first booking of the game, after the left-back raised a hand in the face of Recio. The Malaga midfielder did well to not make a meal of that, either."
7',action,"The away side haven't been asked any questions defensively yet, with Sandro chasing nothing but lost causes. The Catalan giants continue to stroke possession around patiently, probing for any gaps or weaknesses. Jordi Alba is very keen to push up and try and work an overlap with Neymar."
6',action,"Rosales catches Neymar late, which might be a sign of things to come in this game, as Malaga might get a little frustrated with the amount of time they are spending chasing the ball. The hosts are sat very deep, with a bank of four and five. Luis Enrique's men will have to be patient this evening, it seems."
4',action,"Barcelona are dominating possession in the early stages, with Sandro looking quite isolated up top. Malaga are trying to force their opponents wide, by funnelling the pressure into Neymar and Messi, with Suarez buzzing around searching for pockets of space in more central areas. A long, lofted cross from deep on the left is claimed easily by Kameni."
2',action,"Mascherano is indeed playing as a right-back in defence, with Malaga undoubtedly looking at the experienced Argentine as a possible weak link. Denis is playing a little more out on the right-hand side whenever he has the chance to get forward, which sees Messi drop infield in turn."
1',action,"We are underway in the first half in La Rosaleda! Barcelona know that three points will take them above Real Madrid for now in the LaLiga table, and what a psychological blow that could deal to Zinedine Zidane's squad's confidence."
,action,"Barcelona substitutes: Iniesta, Cillessen, Paco Alcacer, Digne, Sergi Roberto, Carles Alena, Alex Carbonell."
,action,"Barcelona starting line-up (4-3-3): Ter Stegen; Mascherano, Umtiti, Mathieu, Alba; Andre Gomes, Busquets, Denis; Messi, Suarez, Neymar."
,action,"Malaga substitutes: Demichelis, Villanueva, Charles, Boyko, Penaranda, Duda, Jony."
,action,"Malaga starting line-up (4-2-3-1): Kameni; Rosales, Luis Hernandez, Diego Llorente, Ricca; Camacho, Recio; Juanpi, Pablo Fornals, Juankar; Sandro."
,action,"TEAM NEWS: Gerard Pique and Ivan Rakitic are both suspended for Barcelona, with Luis Enrique reshuffling slightly as a result. The away side appear to be using a four-man defence, which will feature Jordi Alba and Javier Mascherano as full-backs. Jeremy Mathieu slots in alongside Samuel Umtiti in the heart of it. Andre Gomes and Denis Suarez flank Sergio Busquets in midfield, with the front three as expected - and they've been on fire lately. The likes of Sergi Roberto, Andres Iniesta and young midfielder Carles Alena are on the bench."
,action,"TEAM NEWS: Juanpi returns on the right-hand side after injury for Malaga, with no other surprise selections made for this one. Recio is deployed ahead of Jose Rodriguez in central midfield, with ex-Barcelona striker Sandro getting the nod up top. Juankar continues on the left wing to give left-back Federico Ricca additional cover. Pablo Fornals will look to provide the hosts' creativity in an advanced midfield role. Keko is suspended, but Michel has some depth on his bench."
,action,"Earlier in the season, Malaga picked up a 0-0 stalemate with 9 men at Camp Nou, but since Juande Ramos' departure as manager, they haven't had the same stability. Sporting Gijon fell to an unexpected defeat against Michel's men last time out, which just might fill the underdogs with the belief that they can pull something off this evening. They have only scored 34 goals in 30 league games, however, so they'll need to keep things tight at their own end if they are to stand a chance."
,action,"Hello and welcome to live coverage of Barcelona's trip to face Malaga in LaLiga, with the away side having the chance to temporarily go top of the league if they win here tonight. Real Madrid drew with Atletico earlier today, meaning that Luis Enrique's men have the opportunity to leapfrog their rivals on goal difference if they pick up three points. The hosts earned their first win under new coach Michel last time out, so they could be a potential banana skin."
