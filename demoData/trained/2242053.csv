,action,"And that will do it from the King Power Stadium as Leicester pick up their fourth straight league win, and fifth in all competitions since Shakespeare took over. The decision to sack Claudio Ranieri looks more vindicated with every match as the Foxes move away from the relegation zone. Stoke have now picked up only four points from their last 15 available. That's it from us, thanks for tuning in!"
90'+5',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Marko Arnautović ; Arnautovic is booked with the last act of the game for barging into Fuchs, moments after Crouch's header was pushed away by Schmeichel."
90'+2',action,"Amartey's strike from the edge of the area has the sting taken out of it by a deflection as the last seconds of this game ebb away. Moments later, Adam's low cross into the area is cleared on the stretch by Huth."
90',action,"HE'S MISSED! That should have been the goal to make things interesting. Diouf hangs a cross to the centre of the box where Crouch steals a march on Huth, but the ball comes off his shoulder and goes over. That's his bread and butter."
88',action,"The game has rather petered out here as Stoke's attacks keep stagnating before they reach the danger zone. Leicester try to attack again on the break and Mahrez takes aim, but Grant makes the save."
87',substitution,; The excellent Gray is withdrawn for Ben Chilwell.
85',action,"Fuchs does well to snuff out an attack out wide and moments later, Grant is called into action to deny Gray's effort from long range. Leicester have looked more likely than Stoke to score in the closing stages."
82',action,"Less than 10 minutes to go and it's now or never for Stoke. The visitors keep plugging away in the opposition half, but to little effect so far."
81',substitution,; Vardy has got his goal and will be withdrawn for Islam Slimani.
79',action,"SHOULD HAVE BEEN THREE FOR LEICESTER! Vardy leaps to win an important header that isolates Mahrez against Shawcross. The England striker peels into the box and is in prime position to be teed up, but the Algerian goes for goal himself, putting it into the side netting."
77',action,"Stoke produce a sustained period of pressure in the final third, but it culminates in a layoff for Adam to strike from at least 25 yards. It wasn't too far off, but it was always rising in the end."
74',action,"The game hs slowed down tremendously in the past few minutes, which will suit Leicester just fine. Stoke have tried to show more ambition, but it's nothing more than half chances at best."
73',substitution,"; Okazaki is the latest player to head off, with Amartey replacing him."
71',action,"GOAL RULED OUT! Arnautovic converts and wheels off in celebration, but it's cut short by the assistant referee's flag for an offside. However, he looked to have done nothing wrong on the replay!"
70',substitution,"; Charlie Adam is also introduced, with Whelan making way."
70',substitution,; Mame Biram Diouf has entered the fray in place of Berahino.
69',yellow-card,Yellow Card Peter Crouch ; Crouch checks Okazki with a sliding challenge and Stoke get another booking.
68',action,"Chance for Stoke on the break, but Crouch, under pressure from Schmeichel, fails to steer the ball goalwards. A goal at this stage for the Potters would certainly make things very interesting."
65',action,"Stoke have certainly been under the cosh in the last couple of minutes, and Mahrez tests Grant again with an effort from outside the area, but the keeper is once again equal to it."
62',action,"Leicester are on the counter again, and Ndidi feeds Vardy in space down the left-hand side. The England forward spreads play and tries to feed Okazaki, but the pass breaks down."
60',yellow-card,Yellow Card Christian Fuchs ; Fuchs takes a chunk out of Sobhi with an ill-advised challenge and is booked.
59',action,"Gray has probably been the best player on the pitch, and the wide man feeds Okazaki with a clever throughball, only to see Grant make another commendable stop and turn the ball around the post."
56',action,"Stoke are desperate for a response and Arnautovic challenges for a high ball at the back post, but despite making contact, his header is nowhere near menacing enough to trouble the keeper."
54',substitution,"; Hughes needed to make a change, and he's called on Peter Crouch to replace Walters."
52',action,"The King Power Stadum is buzzing with the home side in complete control. How about Vardy, who has now scored four and assisted two under Shakespeare!"
49',action,"Gray once again gets the better of Stoke out wide, and sets up a half-chance for Ndidi, who goes for it but can't trouble the keeper. Leicester are rolling!"
47',assist,Assist Danny Simpson ; Two assists now for Simpson!
47',goal,"Goal Jamie Vardy ; LEICESTER HAVE A SECOND!!! The hosts race out of the break to double their advantage thanks to a venomous finish from Vardy, who arrived at the far post to rifle in Simpson's cross."
46',action,Off we go again.
,action,"And that will do it from the King Power Stadium. The home side have a deserved lead thanks to a beauty from Ndidi. Stoke have threatened here and there on the break, but mostly, they can be thankful that it's only one goal that they're chasing. Stay tuned for the restart soon."
45'+1',action,Into stoppage time as Pieters has to clear for a corner with Okazaki lurking to latch onto Vardy's ball. Gray takes it again and Huth puts an overhead kick right onto Pieters' face.
44',action,"Sobhi, who has probably been Stoke's best player in the first half, tries to cause danger with a lifted ball into the box, but Schmeichel is all over it."
41',action,"Half time is fast approaching at the King Power Stadium. Mark Hughes will want to use to break to cool off some of his players, as the already booked Shawcross commits another foul on Vardy."
38',action,"That last effort was Stoke's first shot on target in the game. Down at the other end, Leicester test Lee Grant again, but the keeper is more than equal to Mahrez's curler from 20 yards, making a fantastic save."
36',action,"Better from Stoke again as they turn defence into attack. Sobhi drifts to a central position this time and plays another clever pass, with Berahino the beneficiary, but his shot from an angle is smothered."
34',action,"Gray continues to torch Johnson out wide, winning a corner after another piece of great play. He takes the set-piece himself, but it's eventually out for a goal-kick after a spectacular but wayward effort by Okazaki."
32',action,"SIDE NETTING! That was a glorious chance. Stoke work the ball well from one end to the other, and Ramadan Sobhi plays Arnautovic in behind the sleeping Ndidi. The wide man takes it on the turn deep inside the box, but can't find the target!"
29',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Glenn Whelan ; Stoke are starting to get sloppy with some of these challenges, as Gray again uses his pace to bamboozle the defence, only to be chopped down by Whelan. Yellow card."
27',action,Leiceste fully deserve that opener after what has been a first half of increasing dominance. They show their chops at the other end to defend a dangerous set-piece.
25',assist,Assist Danny Simpson ; Simpson will be credited with the assist but that was all Ndidi.
25',goal,"Goal Onyinye Wilfred Ndidi ; NDIDI WITH A STUNNER! Ridiculously good from the Leicester man, who takes a touch outside the area to evade his man and guides a missile into the top corner! No chance for the keeper!"
22',action,"There's a banner being flown over the King Power Stadium. It's a happy birthday message for Leicester chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, whose birthday is tomorrow. Paid for by the Wenger Out brigade."
20',action,"There was the potential for a counterattack for Stoke, but Berahino's pass to Waiters did the visitors no favours."
18',action,"Somehow it doesn't go in! The free-kick is contested by Robert Huth, and Erik Pieters makes a poor clearing header on the line that presents Jamie Vardy with a chance, but he can't make contact!"
16',yellow-card,Yellow Card Ryan Shawcross ; First yellow card of the game goes to Ryan Shawcross and it's a clear one as he was beaten for pace all ends up by Gray. He decided to flatten him with a reckless challenge instead.
15',action,"Okazaki shows some good footwork to bring down a high ball, but he runs out of options and Leicester soon turn the ball over."
13',action,"Jonathan Walters tries to rise to latch onto a deep cross from Johnson, but it's not enough to trouble the defence as Kasper Schmeichel catches the ball in his 250th match for Leicester."
11',action,"As the match has gone on, Leicester are growing in confidence and forcing Stoke to do a lot of defending. The home side's defence is pushing higher up the pitch to win the ball back and keep pressure concentrated in the opposition half."
8',action,"Yohan Benalouane suddenly sees the ball open up for him inside the box near the byline and he hurriedly swings at it, but it ends up flashing across the six-yard area and out."
5',action,"Leicester's first foray into the opposition half produces a decent chance as the ball is swung in at pace into the box, but Marko Arnautovic gets his head to the ball ahead of Shinji Okazaki to clear."
3',action,"Good early pressure from Stoke here, as the visiting side win a corner, but it's well defended by Leicester in the end. The crowd are giving us a bubbly atmosphere."
1',action,We're off!
,action,"Phil Bardsley's red card against Chelsea rules him out of this one with a suspension, while Geoff Cameron is also injured. Mark Hughes calls on Glenn Whelan and Glenn Johnson to replace the pair in his starting lineup."
,action,Demarai Gray comes into the side for Marc Albrighton in Leicester's only change to their XI after the 3-2 win over West Ham before the international beak. Skipper Wes Morgan is still injured.
