,action,Thank you for joining us this evening for our Live Text Commentary of Southampton v Crystal Palace. Goodnight.
,action,FULL-TIME: Southampton get back to winning ways with a 3-1 victory. Palace went ahead through Benteke before Redmond struck just before half-time to drag Claude Puel's side level. The hosts had the better chances in the second half on a night Shane Long will want to forget as he wasted four clear opportunities. Two goals in the final six minutes of the match from Yoshida and Ward-Prowse put the visitors to bed and leave Sam Allardyce's men still in trouble at the bottom end of the table. It has finished at St. Mary's Southampton 3 Crystal Palace 1.
90'+1',action,Four minutes of added time to be played at St. Mary's.
90',substitution,; Substitution: Nathan Redmond's work for the night is done. A solid performance from the newly-capped England winger. Jay Rodriguez makes a cameo appearance
88',yellow-card,Yellow Card Christian Benteke Liolo ; BOOKING: Benteke goes into Roger East's book late in the contest.
88',substitution,; Substitution: The final Palace change of the evening sees Mathieu Flamini replace Milivojevic.

85',goal,Goal James Ward-Prowse ; TWO IN TWO MINUTES FOR SOUTHAMPTON! James Ward-Prowse gets on the end of a Cedric cross to slam home his team's third goal of the evening. It is all over now at St. Mary's.
85',assist,Assist Cédric Ricardo Alves Soares ; Assist Cédric.
83',assist,Assist Jack Stephens ; Assist Jack Stephens.
83',goal,Goal Maya Yoshida ; AT LONG LAST THE SAINTS PRESSURE PAYS OFF. Redmond turns on the afterburners and skins Ward. His low cross is scuffed by Stephens but wriggles its way to Yoshida who slots the ball into an open net. 2-1 the hosts lead and on the balance of play in the second half they have deserved it.
80',action,"OFF THE LINE from Sakho! Redmond zips a ball into Davis. His side-footed effort is blocked on the line from Sakho, the ball finds its way back out to Davis who this time is thwarted by Damien Delaney. Davis is a touch shaken up for his troubles."
79',yellow-card,Yellow Card Cédric Ricardo Alves Soares ; BOOKING: Cédric is the second Southampton player in the book after a cynical challenge on Sako.
76',action,Good stop from Hennessey as he has to be alert to a Romeu long ranged effort which takes multiple deflections before skidding across the turf requiring the attention of the Welsh goalkeeper. The corner brings with it a free header which is easily claimed by Hennessey.
73',action,"Another close shave for the visitors. Tadic flashes a low cross into the six yard area. The ball takes a little flick off a Saints defender, putting it out of reach of Hennessey, but no Southampton forward was gambling on the cross. Gasps of both relief and anguish from the respective sets of fans."
71',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Oriol Romeu Vidal ; BOOKING: Oriol Romeu collects his tenth card of the season and will now miss the next two Southampton games, away at West Brom and at home to Manchester City."
70',action,"PHEW! Just in the nick of time by Forster to intercept a loose pass, otherwise Zaha would have had a simple finish."
69',action,Nervy moment for Southampton as they attempt to play their way out of danger with pressure being applied by Benteke and Townsend. They worm their way out via Yoshida and send the Saints on the forward march.
65',action,"Long could be at St. Mary's all night and not score a goal. This time he is one-on-one with Hennessey and he hits his shot straight at the shot-stopper. Lovely ball from Tadic to get Long free, inch perfect from the playmaker."
64',action,"AGAINST THE POST by Martin Kelly. A long ball from a free-kick into the penalty area, Kelly runs on to a Benteke knock down header and hits a shot against the post. Zaha follows up with a rash effort and sends the ball flying over the bar."
60',action,"A powerful, driving run from Davis sees him get inside the Palace box. His final touch is too heavy, however, and it squirts harmlessly out of play. The Crystal Palace back three parted like the Red Sea, there."
58',substitution,"; Substitution: A second Palace change, Jeffrey Schlupp departs and Damien Delaney joins the action. Looks like Allardyce is shifting to a back three."
56',action,Almost humiliation for Sakho. He attempts to head a cross clear of danger only to get his angles wrong and nearly send the ball into his own net. A sigh of relief and a corner the only damage done.
54',action,"It looks like it may be one of those days for Shane Long. Oriol Romeu wins the ball in midfield before setting Tadic free. Tadic spots the run from the Republic of Ireland striker, who beats Mamadou Sakho for pace, but his chipped effort on the angle is over the bar."
52',action,Lovely improvisation from Townsend. The ball comes in from the left but it is just behind the England winger who opts to flick the ball over his head and has Hennessey scrambling as it just goes over the crossbar via a Cedric deflection.
49',action,OOOOOOO!! HUGE CHANCE for Southampton. Redmond gets to the byline and clips in a teasing ball. Ward-Prowse has his shot superbly blocked before Cedric lashes an effort wide from ten yards out.
46',substitution,; Substitution: Yohan Cabaye was injured at the end of the first half and he is replaced by Bakary Sako.
45',action,KICK-OFF: Southampton get the ball rolling for the start of the second half.
,action,HALF-TIME: Southampton and Crystal Palace enter their respective dressing rooms on level terms after Redmond's goal late in the first half cancelled out Christian Benteke's opener. A couple of controversial decisions made from Roger East who is escorted off the pitch by security to a chorus of boos from all sides of St. Mary's. It is 1-1 at the break.
45',assist,Assist Steven Davis ; Assist Steven Davis.
45',goal,"Goal Nathan Redmond ; LEVELLER!! Redmond brings Puel's men level with scuffed volley which finds the bottom corner. Perhaps Palace will feel a touch aggrieved as Davis appears to foul Zaha in the build-up, nevertheless the cross finds Redmond at the far post and his volley squeezes through a crowd before nestling in the net. 1-1."
42',action,"ANOTHER SPOT KICK denied by Roger East. Southampton win the ball through Tadic, he slips in Long, on the right side of the box, who is brought down by Milivojevic. The Saints fans are truly vexed now."
40',action,"PENALTY SHOUT for the home side. Tadic is incensed as he attempts to flick the ball past Jeffery Schlupp, who appears to bat the ball away. Nothing doing for referee Roger East."
38',action,High and wide from Zaha. Townsend sends a cute clip into the box which is only half cleared by Yoshida before bouncing towards Zaha. The winger looks for a powerful half volley but sends his effort into orbit.
37',action,"Another free-kick in a dangerous position for the visitors. Zaha is all over the place for Palace and causing Southampton all kinds of problems. This time the Ivory Coast winger wins a free-kick on the left of the Southampton penalty area after being fouled by Ward-Prowse. Poor delivery from Cabaye, however."
34',action,It's Claude Puel's turn to look frustrated on the touchline after seeing his side fall behind.
31',assist,Assist Andros Townsend ; Assist Andros Townsend. A lovely low cross from the winger takes out every Saints defender in the penalty area to find his Belgian striker.
31',goal,Goal Christian Benteke Liolo ; GREAT GOAL!! The visitors take the lead after a delightful sweeping move from the front four. Zaha skips past two Southampton players before playing a simple pass to Jason Puncheon. He plays it square to Townsend who powers into the box and flashes a lovely ball into the path of Benteke who had the simplest of finishes. 1-0 Palace.
26',action,CHANCE!! Zaha stutters then fires his shot into Maya Yoshida and it goes out for a corner. Lovely cushioned header into his path by Benteke. Maybe the big Belgian could have picked out Yohan Cabaye who was free in the Southampton penalty area.
25',action,Another half chance for Long. Ward-Prowse sends in an inviting free-kick from just inside the Palace half and Long flicks his header wide.
23',action,"A marvellous bit of skill from Benteke as he turns Jack Stephens, throwing in a little nutmeg for good measure, before having his right foot shot blocked."
20',action,WOODWORK!! This time it's Southampton who hit the post. A delicious cross from the right by Cedric Soares is met by a towering header from Redmond. He leaps like a salmon to beat Joel Ward to the ball before seeing his effort cannon back off the post - the header had Wayne Hennessey beaten.
18',action,A big opportunity wasted for Palace. They break with four men forward but Andros Townsend fails to see a wide open Zaha on the right. Townsend's pass instead goes out of play for a Southampton throw in.
16',action,Big Sam is looking much more relaxed in the dugout as his team are finally getting settled into the contest.
13',action,WOODWORK! Luka Milivojevic curls the ball around the red and white Saints wall and clips the bottom of the post before going harmlessly out of play. Fraser Forster was rooted to the spot.
12',action,A free-kick in a dangerous position for the visitors as Wilfried Zaha is brought down 25-yards from goal.
10',action,DANGER FOR PALACE. James Ward-Prowse plays a delightful ball to split the two Palace defenders but Long can't direct his shot into the back of the net - second prize is the corner.
8',action,"Finally, Crystal Palace mount an attack - albeit from a soft corner. A quality delivery into the box and Christian Benteke has a free header but skews it wide."
7',action,Sam Allardyce is prowling the touchline. He's clearly not happy with the start his side have made.
5',action,Redmond's elusiveness is causing the Crystal Palace back four some more problems. This time the England winger picks the ball up in a central position before picking out Dusan Tadic in the penalty area. Unfortunately for the Saints supporters Tadic could not trouble Wayne Hennessey with his effort on goal.
4',action,The away side have hardly had a kick in the opening minutes. Southampton firmly camped in the Palace half so far.
1',action,"Early Southampton chance. Nathan Redmond slips a clever ball through to Shane Long, the striker gets in behind Kelly and his shot from a tight angle goes narrowly wide."
1',action,KICK-OFF: Palace get us underway at St. Mary's.
,action,"Palace are looking for their fifth win in a row in the Premier League. Southampton, by contrast, are looking for their first victory since a 4-3 thriller at Watford in early March."
,action,The Saints hold a good record over The Eagles having won their last five encounters - and losing just one of the last 13 meetings.
,action,"A win for Palace could pull them seven points clear of the relegation zone. For Southampton, they could rise up the table to a possible ninth place with a victory."
,action,Allardyce makes just one change to the starting team that shocked Chelsea at Stamford Bridge with Martin Kelly replacing the injured James Tomkins in the heart of defence.
,action,Just two changes for the home side after their goalless draw against Bournemouth. Sam McQueen comes in at left-back while Shane Long replaces Jay Rodriguez up top.
,action,Sam Allardyce has also opted for a 4-2-3-1 shape tonight.
,action,"Palace substitutes: Sako, Flamini, Speroni, Delaney, Kaikai, Fryers, Chung-young."
,action,"Crystal Palace starting XI: Hennessey (GK); Ward, Kelly, Sakho, Schlupp; Cabaye, Milivojevic, Townsend, Puncheon (C), Zaha; Benteke."
