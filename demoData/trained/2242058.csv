,action,"That's all from Vicarage Road! Thank you for following our LIVE coverage of the Barclays Premier League - hope you enjoyed it. Until next time, see you soon!"
,action,"Miguel Britos' first goal for Watford gives them a first victory in five attempts and moves the Hornets up to 10th in the Premier League table. However, Sunderland remain seven points from safety at the bottom after yet another defeat."
,action,FULL-TIME: WATFORD 1-0 SUNDERLAND
90'+6',action,Khazri sends the delivery straight into the wall and Mr Probert swiftly blows for full-time!
90'+5',action,Free-kick to Sunderland! Cleverley brings down Khazri 30 yards from goal and the visitors have one final opportunity...
90'+3',yellow-card,Yellow Card Etienne Capoue ; Capoue is shown a yellow card for bringing down Oviedo. Sunderland have 60 seconds!...
90'+1',action,"FOUR MINUTES! That is how many minutes of added time that Sunderland have to find an equaliser here. However, O'Shea has just conceded a free-kick inside his own half and Watford will certainly take their time now..."
89',action,"Watford deal with the delivery and, after Borini pumps the ball back into the box, Gomes gratefully gathers from the air. Ironically, the Watford keeper was on the bench for Tottenham when the Italian made his Premier League debut for Chelsea back in September 2009."
88',action,The Black Cats have really come to life over these past few minutes and looking a lot more menacing. They are awarded another free-kick and Khazri is standing over the ball...
87',substitution,"; Niang is given a breather after an impressive display and replaced by Juan Zuniga, who comes on for his first appearance since January 14."
85',action,"The Italian, who has only scored once this season, has admitted that his form had dipped this season after being instructed to play as a utility man during the campaign. However, he has looked very lively over these past few minutes."
83',action,"GOOD SAVE! That was better by the Black Cats as Borini finds some space and lets fly from outside the box, but Gomes springs to his left and palms the effort away."
82',action,"Sunderland have spent 138 days at the bottom of the Premier League table this season and, barring a miraculous change of fortune, it looks increasingly like that will continue here."
80',action,"Defoe has barely had a sight at goal all game and looks to get in behind the Watford defence. However, Gomes is quickly out to gather, although the offside flag had already been raised."
78',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Lamine Koné ; Niang shows good strength to outmuscle Kone, who prevents the Milan loanee from advancing any further and is the next Sunderland player into the book."
77',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Wahbi Khazri ; Khazri demonstrates his frustration a little too aggressively towards the linesman after a decision goes against him, and he is rightly booked by the referee."
74',action,"We are approaching the final quarter of an hour at Vicarage Road where, if they hold on, Watford will equal their best tally of home wins in a Premier League season with a sixth success."
72',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Billy Jones ; Jones is shown the first yellow card of the game by the referee. Ironically, the right-back, who turned 30 during the international break, scored against Watford for Preston North End back in October 2008."
72',action,"Having played such a key role in Sunderland's survival last season, Khazri is making his 12th appearance as a substitute of this campaign having started just four times. The president of the Tunisian Football Federation blocked his call-up to the national side because of a ""poor attitude"" last week, but he will want to let his football do the talking for the rest of the term."
70',substitution,; The Sunderland fans cheer as Moyes turns to Wahbi Khazri for the final 20 minutes. Januzaj is the player to make way.
68',action,GREAT EFFORT! Holebas receives the ball after a Watford attack is initially dealt with. The left-back lets fly from 25 yards out and his effort is just over the bar with Pickford beaten.
67',action,"That really was the finish of a player low on confidence in front of goal. In fact, since arriving on loan from Manchester United, Januzaj has only found the net once and that was back in August against Shrewsbury Town in the EFL Cup."
65',action,"POOR SHOT! N'Dong has looked lively since his introduction four minutes ago. The Gabon international shows great awareness to pick out Januzaj on the edge of the box, but the Belgian's effort is tame and straight at Gomes."
62',action,"GOOD SAVE! Watford threaten to double their lead as Success is released through the middle. However, Pickford is quickly out of goal to make an important block, before Doucoure's follow-up is deflected behind for a corner."
61',substitution,; Moyes looks straight to the bench and Gibson is withdrawn to be replaced by Didier N'Dong.
61',action,That was Britos' first goal for Watford and it could prove to be a very important one in the context of their season. It is also the first time that the Uruguayan has found the net for over two years.
59',assist,Assist Craig Cathcart ; Cathcart showed great awareness to pick out Britos at the far post.
59',goal,"Goal Miguel Ángel Britos Cabrera ; WATFORD TAKE THE LEAD!!! Britos breaks the deadlock! Cleverley's corner is met by Okaka, whose deflected header crashes against the bar. Cathcart then heads the ball towards the far post, where Britos nods home to put the hosts in front!"
57',action,"Holebas embarks on a strong run down the left and cuts inside before trying his luck from quite a way out. However, the Greek's right-footed effort drifts aimlessly wide of the post."
55',action,"Success arrived from Granada for £12.5 million at the start of this season, but has only found the net once in 14 appearances so far. However, having made his Nigeria debut against Senegal last week, will be buoyed and hopeful of scoring his first goal since October."
53',substitution,"; Amrabat has lasted 53 minutes on his first Premier League start for over two months. However, the Moroccan appears very unhappy as he is replaced by record signing Isaac Success, who makes his 14th appearance as a substitute this season."
51',action,"The seventh-highest goalscorer in Premier League history with 157 to his name, Defoe has netted 14 times from 22 shots on target for Sunderland this season, and his endless threat will be highly important over these final 10 games in the Black Cats' bid for survival."
49',action,"Defoe, who scored on his England return after four years away from the international scene last week, is yet to find the net against Watford in the Premier League. Although, he seems determined to do so after hobbling to the touchline before soon getting back onto the pitch."
47',action,WORRY! Defoe goes down clutching his leg following a fairly innocuous challenge with Doucoure. He and Sunderland will be desperately hoping that it is nothing serious and that the England striker is able to continue.
46',action,KICK-OFF! The referee blows his whistle and Watford get the ball rolling once more.
,action,The teams are back out on the field and the second half is imminent...
,action,"Sunderland have now gone seven hours without finding the net in the Premier League, although Moyes will be happy to be going in at half-time with the score at 0-0. Both sides have looked good going forward, but you feel that the deadlock being broken after the break would see the contest truly burst into life."
,action,HALF-TIME: WATFORD 0-0 SUNDERLAND
45'+3',action,"And, with that, Mr Probert blows the whistle for half-time!"
45'+2',action,"Britos' last goal came against Juventus for Napoli in January 2015. The Uruguayan looks to end that spell by poking the ball towards the target after being found by Amrabat, but his effort is tame and easily gathered by Pickford."
45'+1',action,There will be two minutes of stoppage time at the end of this first half and now would be such a great time for either side to break the deadlock.
44',action,"GOOD SAVE! Watford deal with Sunderland's corner and launch a very dangerous counter-attack, from which an unmarked Niang is found just outside the penalty area. He lets fly with his left foot, but Pickford gets down well to block."
43',action,"NERVY! Januzaj's shot from outside the area takes a deflection off Cathcart, and a wrong-footed Gomes has to quickly scramble across to watch the ball drift just wide of the post."
42',substitution,"; Kaboul hobbles off to be replaced by former Newcastle United defender Daryl Janmaat, who is greeted by boos from the Sunderland supporters."
41',action,"The Frenchman was in tears when Sunderland secured their survival at the end of last season, although he will want to cry for very different reasons after pulling up suddenly there."
39',action,"OUCH! Kaboul suddenly pulls up clutching his hamstring and the medical team are immediately on the pitch to tend to him. However, it appears more than likely that the former Sunderland man will be departing earlier than planned against his former club."
37',action,"The former Tottenham man made a very impressive scoring start to the season - netting four times in Watford's opening five matches. However, he has only managed one goal in his 23 appearances since then, which came against Leicester City back in November."
35',action,JUST WIDE! Capoue and Okaka combine down the left before the former lets fly with a powerful shot from just outside the area that flashes past the far post.
32',action,"There was uncertainty as to whether O'Shea would play today after suffering the effects of that shocking challenge from Gareth Bale on international duty last week. However, he has shaken off the knock and his presence is important as he makes a well-timed challenge in the area to deny Okaka from getting in behind."
30',action,"The 22-year-old, who is on loan here since arriving from AC Milan in January, said in the week that he will ""work like a dog"" to ensure a return to his highest performance levels, which saw him attract interest from the likes of Juventus, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur during his youth career at Caen."
28',action,"GREAT RUN! Niang picks up the ball inside his own half and shows great footwork as he embarks on a strong venture deep into Sunderland territory. However, his threat is eventually snuffed out by the visitors, who gather in numbers to deal with the situation."
26',action,"Watford work a short corner well before delivering the ball to the far post, where Kaboul climbs highest but is unable to direct it towards goal and Sunderland clear the danger."
24',action,"Each of the last three meetings between the two sides at Vicarage Road have ended in draws and today's match appears to be following that trend so far, with neither side really dominating proceedings."
22',action,"Sunderland snuff out the danger following a Watford corner and play some neat football inside their opponents' half. However, it all counts for nothing as Denayer overhits an attempted diagonal ball which goes aimlessly behind for a goal-kick."
20',action,"FREE HEADER! Okaka should have put Watford in front there! He stole a yard on his marker to meet Capoue's inviting cross, but was unable to test Pickford and find the net for the second game running at Vicarage Road."
18',action,"The Italian striker is only making only his sixth start of the season today with Deeney dropping to the bench, and that was good, positive play that will have pleased his manager."
16',action,"Okaka receives the ball just inside the Sunderland half and takes on O'Shea and Oviedo, but his touch to get beyond Kone is just too heavy and Pickford is quickly out to gather."
13',action,Only Tom Heaton and Ben Foster have made more saves than Pickford in the Premier League this season. The England under-21 international showed very good reflexes there and showed why he is being tipped for a call-up to the senior team.
11',action,"GOOD DOUBLE SAVE! Watford apply the pressure and Pickford does well to get down and beat away Niang's effort from a tight angle, before producing an equally smart save to deny Doucoure's shot shortly afterwards."
10',action,"It has been a very open start to this match with both sides looking threatening going forward. This time, Britos is forced to come across and make a vital clearance with Defoe lurking around the penalty area."
8',action,"Watford look to catch Sunderland out on the counter attack with Niang leading the charge. However, he is not on the same wavelength as Okaka, who does not read his attempted through ball and Pickford gathers."
6',action,"Nothing comes of the corner but they were positive signs from Rodwell. Ironically, his most recent goal came here at Vicarage Road on the final day of last season and the former Manchester City man was not too far away there."
4',action,"At the other end, Rodwell embarks on a strong run into the area before his left-footed effort deflects behind off Kaboul for a corner. This is a good early opportunity for the visitors..."
2',action,"VITAL CLEARANCE! Watford launch the first meaningful attack of the game with Amrabat's deflected cross looping dangerously towards the far post. However, Jones gets there ahead of Okaka to head to safety and nothing comes from the subsequent corner."
1',action,KICK-OFF! Lee Probert is our referee today and it is his first Premier League appointment since May 2015. He blows his whistle and Sunderland get the match underway.
,action,HERE THEY COME! The teams are making their way out onto the field and kick-off is just moments away...
,action,"SUNDERLAND SUBS: Mannone, Djilobodji, Cattermole, Larsson, Khazri, N'Dong, Manquilo."
,action,"SUNDERLAND (5-3-2): Pickford; Jones, Kone, O'Shea, Denayer, Oviedo; Gibson, Januzaj, Rodwell; Borini, Defoe."
,action,"In the week that it was announced that David Moyes would remain in charge of Sunderland even if they are relegated at the end of the season, he makes just a single change from the 0-0 draw with Burnley. Lamine Kone returns from a knee injury to form part of a five-man defence alongside John O'Shea, who has shaken off a leg injury to captain the side. Sebastian Larsson makes way and is joined on the bench by Lee Cattermole, who is back in the squad following a six-month absence with hip and back injuries."
,action,"WATFORD SUBS: Pantilimon, Prodl, Mariappa, Deeney, Success, Zuniga, Janmaat."
,action,"WATFORD (3-4-2-1): Gomes (c); Cathcart, Kaboul, Britos; Amrabat, Doucoure, Cleverley, Holebas; Capoue, Niang; Okaka."
,action,"Walter Mazzarri makes four changes to the Watford side that were beaten 1-0 at Crystal Palace before the international break. Heurelho Gomes captains the side as Troy Deeney drops to the bench with illness, as does Sebastian Prodl after suffering a calf problem. Jose Holebas, Abdoulaye Doucoure, Nordin Amrabat and Stefano Okaka all return to the starting 11 alongside Tom Cleverley, who will join the Hornets from Everton on a permanent deal at the end of the season. Younes Kaboul faces his former club."
,action,"It may be April Fool's Day but only the winners will be laughing today as Watford aim to move further clear of the relegation zone, while bottom club Sunderland are desperate to move to within four points of safety and boost their survival chances."
,action,"Hello everyone and welcome to our LIVE text coverage of the Barclays Premier League! Today, we're at Vicarage Road as Watford and Sunderland look to end their four-match winless streaks in the English top-flight - losing three. It's good to have your company!"
