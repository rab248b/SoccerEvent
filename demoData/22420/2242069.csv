,action,"Chelsea restore their seven-point advantage at the top of the Premier League table with a comfortable win over Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium. Adam Smith's own goal opened the scoring before Eden Hazard doubled Chelsea's lead, and although Josh King pulled a goal back for the hosts moments before half time, Chelsea were never really in danger and secured the three points when Marcos Alonso curled in a sublime second half free-kick. That's all from us for today, thanks for joining us and we hope you can join us again soon."
,action,Full-time: Bournemouth 1-3 Chelsea
90'+2',substitution,Substitution sub-out Victor Moses sub-in Kurt Zouma . Antonio Conte is maintaining his record of making all three substitutions in every league game this season as he brings sub-in Kurt Zouma on to replace Moses in the second of three minutes of added time.
90'+1',yellow-card,Yellow Card Max-Alain Gradel. Gradel becomes the latest player to go into the book for a needless late challenge.
89',action,"A half-chance for Bournemouth as Mousset brings down Daniels's cross from the left-hand side on his chest 10 yards out from goal, but the ball won't quite sit down for him and Cahill is able to hack the ball clear."
88',substitution,Substitution sub-out Pedro Eliezer Rodríguez Ledesma sub-in Willian Borges da Silva . A second change for Chelsea as Pedro is replaced by Willian. The Spaniard is certainly in no rush to get off the field either.
86',action,"Chelsea are sitting pretty deep now and allowing Bournemouth to have the majority of possession, but they look extremely comfortable nonetheless."
84',substitution,Substitution sub-out Ryan Fraser sub-in Max-Alain Gradel . Bournemouth are also making another substitution as Max Gradel comes on for Fraser.
84',substitution,Substitution sub-out Eden Hazard sub-in Francesc Fàbregas i Soler . Chelsea are making their first change now with the impressive Hazard going off to be replaced by Cesc Fabregas.
82',action,"Chelsea are still looking for a fourth goal to kill this game off as Alonso breaks away down the left before whipping in another superb cross towards Costa who's arriving late, but Cook tracks his man well and gets to the ball first to head it away."
80',action,"What a save!! Pedro frees Moses up in space down the right-hand side and the wing-back drives into the penalty box before cutting inside onto his left foot and hitting a fierce effort towards goal, but Boruc stays big and makes a superb save to deny Chelsea a fourth goal."
78',action,"Kante looks to break away down the left-hand touchline but is bundled to the floor by King just in front of Antonio Conte, who goes absolutely crazy as referee Marriner decides not to award a free-kick to his side."
77',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Benik Afobe sub-in Lys Mousset . Eddie Howe's making another change now in an attempt to get back into this game, although it appears to be a like-for-like replacement with sub-in Lys Mousset replacing Afobe."
74',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Pedro Eliezer Rodríguez Ledesma. Pedro is the latest player to be shown a yellow card, after following through on Arter after the ball had gone. The Spaniard was very apologetic for the challenge but doesn't escape punishment from referee Marriner."
72',action,Chance!! Another chance for Chelsea as Hazard drifts a cross in towards Alonso at the back post but the wing-back can only head the ball over the bar on the stretch. He may have been better leaving that for Pedro who was unmarked behind him.
71',substitution,Substitution sub-out Marc Pugh sub-in Jordon Ibe . A first change for Bournemouth now as Jordan Ibe comes on to replace Pugh.
70',action,"Another goal would surely put this game to bed and Chelsea come close to getting it as Moses drives into the six yard box close to the byline on the right-hand side, but he's unable to pick out Costa with the cross."
68',goal,"Goal Marcos Alonso Mendoza. GOOOOAAAAAALLLLLL!!!!! Costa is brought down 25 yards out from goal by Cook and Alonso steps up to send a wonderful, curling free-kick over the wall and into the top corner."
66',action,"This time it's Bournemouth's turn to play the nice football with Arter, Wilshere and Fraser all involved in spreading the ball wide to Daniels on the left-hand corner of the penalty box, but the left-back goes for goal and strikes his effort straight into Azpilicueta."
64',action,"Lovely football from Chelsea as Hazard sweeps a long ball out to Moses in space on the right-hand side, but his cross doesn't match the build up and is easily intercepted at the near post. Chelsea haven't quite got going in the final third so far in this half."
62',action,Wilshere goes on another driving run towards the Chelsea penalty box but he's well tackled by Alonso. The on-loan Arsenal man looks as likely as anybody in a Bournemouth shirt to open this Chelsea defence up at the minute.
60',action,"Chelsea once again push forward and Luiz lifts a ball over the top for Costa to get on the end of, but Francis tracks him well once more and heads the ball clear. Chelsea still look extremely dangerous but that free-kick will be a reminder that Bournemouth are still very much in this game."
58',yellow-card,"Yellow Card N'Golo Kanté. Kante is shown a yellow card for bringing down King 30 yards out from goal and Bournemouth have a free-kick in a good position. They take it short to Francis who drills it towards goal and although the shot is blocked it bounces into the path of King eight yards out from goal, but the flag goes up for offside against the striker."
56',action,"Chance!!! Another huge chance for Costa as he spreads the ball wide to Alonso before making a good run across the near post where he's picked out by Alonso's low, fizzing cross, but the striker fails to make any contact with the ball and Bournemouth escape once again."
54',action,"Close!! Chelsea now go close as Hazard gets to the byline inside the Bournemouth penalty box on the right-hand side, and although his initial cross is blocked by Francis, the winger reacts quickly to put another cross into the middle but it just evades Costa at the back post."
52',action,"Bournemouth have been the better of the two sides so far in this half and Wilshere looks to unlock the Chelsea defence with a long ball over the top for Afobe, but the wet ground causes the ball to skip away from the striker and out for a goal kick."
50',action,"CLOSE!! Pugh and Afobe exchange a neat one-two on the edge of the Chelsea penalty box before the latter lays the ball off to Fraser to his right, and the winger drills a low effort inches wide of the left-hand post from 25 yards out. Courtois looked to be beaten too there."
48',action,A relatively slow start to the second half from both sides which will suit Bournemouth as they struggled with Chelsea's pace and power in the first half.
46',action,Kick-off! Referee Andre Marriner blows his whistle and Bournemouth get the second half underway.
,action,"That goal has certainly given Bournemouth lifeline, but Eddie Howe will know they will need to improve significantly in the second half if they want to take anything from this game. Chelsea meanwhile will be wondering how they only have a one goal advantage, and will be looking to make a fast start to the second half to put the game beyond Bournemouth's reach."
,action,"Chelsea looked to be in control for the majority of the half and raced into a 2-0 lead thanks to a Smith own goal and a well taken goal from Hazard, and they could easily have extended their lead further. Bournemouth though got themselves back into the game shortly before the interval as King's deflected effort beat Courtois after Afobe had earlier hit the post."
,action,Half-time: Bournemouth 1-2 Chelsea
45'+2',action,"Bournemouth have one last chance before the interval as Fraser stands over a free-kick on the right-hand side, but the delivery is far too deep and Courtois is easily able to catch the ball high above his head."
45'+1',action,We're into two minutes of added time at the end of the first half.
44',action,"Antonio Conte is absolutely furious on the touchline and perhaps understandably so, as replays appear to show a Bournemouth handball in the build up to that goal."
42',assist,"Assist Benik Afobe. Afobe played a simple pass into King's feet from just inside the Chelsea half, but that goal really did come out of nowhere."
42',goal,"Goal Joshua King. GOOOOAAAALLLLL!!!! Bournemouth pull one back out of nowhere as Afobe feeds the ball into King down the right hand side and with very little support the striker goes for goal from the right-hand corner of the box, and his well-struck effort takes a deflection off Luiz to beat Courtois and find the back of the net."
40',action,Costa turns away from King with ease just inside the Bournemouth half but for once the striker's distribution is poor as his attempted pass towards intercepted by Fraser. Bournemouth really need a spell of possession now to take the intensity out of this game as they're being overrun at the moment.
38',yellow-card,Yellow Card Harry Arter. Arter becomes the second player to be shown a yellow card having cynically brought down Costa. He may well have felt as though he needed to make that challenge though as Bournemouth were badly exposed.
36',action,"Close!! This is far too easy from a Bournemouth point of view as Chelsea once again find space down the right-hand side, this time through Hazard who picks out Moses six yards out from goal, but he can only turn his header narrowly wide of the post."
35',action,"Costa this time drops deep to gain possession before spreading the ball wide to Moses who has acres of space on the right-hand edge of the Bournemouth penalty box, but his cut-back is just behind Hazard who is surrounded by Bournemouth defenders by the time brings it under control and the chance passes."
33',action,Chelsea are looking extremely dangerous going forward now and Simon Francis has to be alert to stick with Costa and get a good tackle in as the striker looks to get through on goal once again.
31',action,"Hazard breaks forward at pace once again and slips a neat reverse pass into the feet of Pedro who cuts inside onto his left-foot, but he fires his shot comfortably over the bar from 25 yards out. Hazard is causing Bournemouth all sorts of problems at the moment."
29',action,"OFF THE POST!!! Wonderful football from Bournemouth as they work the ball wide to Daniels on the left and the full-back swings in a delightful early cross straight into the path of Benik Afobe, but the striker's first-time volley bounces off the inside of the post and rolls agonisingly across the face of goal."
28',action,"Fraser strikes it well but can't get it over the four-man wall. Chelsea then break forward down the left-hand side through Hazard who pulls the ball back for Costa in the penalty box, but he drags his shot wide of the far post from 10 yards out."
26',action,Wilshire goes on a surging run towards the Chelsea penalty box and is brought down by Luiz 25 yards out from goal. The defender escapes a yellow card but this is a good position for Bournemouth.
24',action,Bournemouth may well have to change their approach of just sitting off and allowing Chelsea to have the majority of possession now that they're chasing the game as Chelsea look extremely comfortable at the minute.
22',action,Unsurprisingly those goals appear to have rattled Bournemouth a little after what was a pretty good start from Eddie Howe's side.
20',assist,Assist N'Golo Kanté. The Bournemouth defence were playing a pretty high line and Kante spotted the space in behind before picking out Hazard with a superb ball over the top.
20',goal,"Goal Eden Hazard. GOOOOAAALLLLL!!! Hazard doubles Chelsea's lead!! Kante plays a wonderful ball over the top of the Bournemouth defence for Hazard to chase, and the Belgian controls the ball brilliantly before rounding Artur Boruc and sliding it in from a tight angle."
17',own-goal,"Own Goal Adam Smith. GOOOOAAAALLLLL!!!! Chelsea take the lead!! Moses picks out Costa with a low cross into the middle from the right-hand side and he turns well before slicing his effort from 12 yards out, but Chelsea get a huge slice of fortune as the ball, which was going wide, deflects off Smith and finds its way into the bottom corner."
16',action,"A half-chance for Bournemouth as Jack Wilshere picks out Fraser with a perfectly weighted pass and the Scottish winger is one-on-one with Luiz, but the defender backs off well and forces Fraser into firing wide from 18 yards."
14',action,Harry Arter makes a crunching tackle on Eden Hazard close to the left-hand touchline which draws a bemused look from the Chelsea man as referee Andre Marriner waves play on. The home fans certainly appreciated that tackle though.
12',action,"Eddie Howe will be pretty pleased with the way his side have started with Chelsea struggling to find any way through what is a pretty crowded midfield, with Josh King dropping back and sitting just in front of his midfield when Chelsea are in possession."
10',action,"Nemanja Matic picks out Moses in space on the right-hand touchline and the wing-back's cross goes all the way through to Marcos Alonso who is unmarked beyond the far post, but his fierce low drive is well blocked by Adam Smith."
8',yellow-card,Yellow Card Victor Moses. Victor Moses is shown the first yellow card of the game as he stumbles under pressure from Charlie Daniels and subsequently prevents the Bournemouth left-back from breaking forward by deliberately handling the ball.
6',action,Fraser does well to win a corner on the right-hand side but it's taken short to Adam Smith who then loses possession. Courtois looks to be having difficulties looking straight into the sun at the minute so Bournemouth may well look to get crosses into the Chelsea penalty area as often as possible.
4',action,After a slightly frantic opening Chelsea are starting to settle into the game now as they knock the ball around close to the halfway line with relative ease. Bournemouth don't look as though they're going to put too much pressure on their opponents when they don't have the ball.
2',action,"Save!! Nearly a wonderful start for Bournemouth as Ryan Fraser whips in an early cross from the right-hand side and David Luiz slices his attempted clearance back towards his own goal, but Thibaut Courtois reacts quickly to punch the ball away."
1',action,Kick-off! Diego Costa gets the game underway for Chelsea.
,action,The players are making their way out onto the pitch. Kick-off is not far away now.
,action,"Hazard and Pedro both got on the scoresheet as Chelsea ran out 3-0 winners when the two sides met at Stamford Bridge on Boxing Day, with Steve Cook also scoring a stoppage time own goal as Chelsea set a new club record of 12 consecutive Premier League wins."
,action,"Chelsea make two changes to the side that beat Manchester City, with Victor Moses and Nemanja Matic replacing Kurt Zouma and Cesc Fabregas."
,action,"Eddie Howe makes just one change to his Bournemouth side that drew with Liverpool, as Ryan Fraser returns in place of Jordan Ibe on the right of midfield."
,action,"Subs: Begovic, Chalobah, Zouma, Terry, Willian, Fabregas, Batshuayi"
,action,"Chelsea (3-4-2-1): Courtois; Azpilicueta, Luiz, Cahill; Moses, Matic, Kante, Alonso; Pedro, Hazard; Costa"
,action,"Subs: Allsop, Cargill, Smith, Ibe, Cook, Gradel, Mousset"
,action,"Teams: Bournemouth (4-4-2): Boruc; Smith, Francis, Cook, Daniels; Fraser, Arter, Wilshere, Pugh; King, Afobe"
,action,"They do still sit top of the Premier League table, however the defeat to Palace has given Tottenham Hotspur a glimmer of hope in the title race, and Antonio Conte will be eager for his side to restore a seven point advantage with a win today after Spurs closed the gap to just four points with their win over Watford."
,action,"Chelsea meanwhile bounced back from a shock 2-1 defeat at home to Crystal Palace last weekend by beating Manchester City by the same score line in midweek, thanks to two goals from in-form Eden Hazard."
,action,"That run, which has also included wins over Swansea and West Ham United, has moved them seven points clear of the relegation zone, after a dreadful start to 2017 saw them go seven league games without a win."
,action,"Bournemouth come into the game on the back of a five game unbeaten run, including impressive draws at both Manchester United and Liverpool."
