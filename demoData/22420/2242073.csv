,action,"So it finishes as it started here, with no goals between Middlesbrough and Burnley. A result that will feel like two points lost for the home side, who stay mired in the relegation zone. Boro were the better team in the second half but weren't able to make it count. That's all from us, thanks for tuning in."
90'+4',action,"Clayton's free-kick is helped on by Ayala, but Negredo's tame header is taken away from goal. Moments later, the ball is sent in for Ayala, who thumps it over the bar. And that may just be that."
90'+4',substitution,Substitution sub-out Ashley Barnes sub-in James Tarkowski . Substitution  sub-out Ashley Barnes sub-in James Tarkowski
90'+2',action,"What an opportunity! A terrific flick from Negredo frees Bamford just ahead of the defence, but Keane keeps up with him and this time makes a commendable challenge to get rid of the danger."
90',action,"Neatly done by Mee to head a Downing cross back into the safety of his goalkeeper's arms. Heaton was in no hurry to restart the game, and a few of the home fans got on his back for it."
87',action,"JUST WIDE! Downing's free-kick is narrowly diverted out for a corner. Moments later, the fans are celebrating as Negredo lashed the ball home, but the whistle had already gone for handball."
85',yellow-card,Yellow Card Michael Keane. Keane can thank his lucky stars that he was only shown a yellow.
84',action,"Now then, big talking point! A long ball out of the back finds Bamford, who uses his fresh legs to get away from Keane. A reckless lunge from the Burnley man takes the substitute out. Definitely a goal-scoring opportunity denied, and he looked to be the last defender too!"
83',substitution,Substitution sub-out Bernardo José Espinosa Zúñiga sub-in Patrick Bamford . sub-in Patrick Bamford is introduced for Espinosa.
81',action,Tempers continue to flare in this game as another rough challenge leaves the referee with some fires to put out. The home fans are invested in this game once again for the final stretch.
78',action,"Not a whole lot happening from ope play in the past few minutes. This will definitely be two points dropped for Boro if the result holds, considering they're at home and in dire straits in the relegation battle."
76',action,"NOT TOO FAR AWAY! Burnley win a free-kick that Brady stands over once again. He bends it over the wall but it starts to dip just a little too late, dropping onto the roof of the net."
73',action,"Ward attempts a long throw towards Vokes which is sent right back him. He then sends in a more dangerous ball from a cross, but somehow, Boro throw the kitchen sink at it and get it clear."
70',action,"Mee lets Traore skip past him down the wing after initially looking to have the situation under control. It's squared for Clayton, who fires an effort right down the throat of the goalkeeper."
69',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Rudy Gestede sub-in Adama Traoré Diarra . Another substitution, with Gestede heading off for Traore."
67',action,"TREMENDOUS ALL AROUND! Negredo attacks a cross into the area with a fantastic overhead kick, which was denied by an equally outstanding reflex save from Heaton!"
64',action,"Yet another player down on the deck in need of treatment, as Ward comes off worse for wear in a challenge with Clayton. Looks like he'll be alright to continue though."
62',action,Valdes and Barnes both need to get treated after colliding with each other inside the area. This has certainly not been a match for the faint of heart.
62',substitution,Substitution sub-out Andre Gray sub-in Sam Vokes . Vokes enters the fray and off goes sub-out Andre Gray.
59',action,Barragan looked to have taken a clip in the head after that last attempted tackle on Ward. He's certainly been in the wars today. The physios accompany him to the sidelines.
58',substitution,Substitution sub-out Cristhian Ricardo Stuani Curbelo sub-in Álvaro Negredo Sánchez . Stuani is off and on comes Negredo.
57',action,"BIG CHANCE! Barragan commits too early with a sliding tackle, which leaves Ward in space to get the cross in. It's dummied and left for the onrushing Brady, who puts it over from just inside the area."
54',action,"You already get the sense that the first goal, if there is to be one in this game, will probably be the one to decide the game. Boro have been the marginally better side in the second half but it's still so close."
51',action,"Downing again gets on the end of a half-chance, but this time, it's from a lot further out and the keeper can watch his snap-shot bobble harmlessly wide of the target."
48',yellow-card,Yellow Card Ashley Barnes. Barnes gets his name taken for throwing himself into Leadbitter.
48',action,"Clayton pings a great ball to the back post, where Downing arrives. The ball was begging to be struck first-time, but he tries to square it for Gestede, leading to a corner instead. Moments later, the striker's header is swallowed by the keeper."
46',action,Off we go again.
,action,"And that will do it for the first half. A game with plenty of spark, but not enough flame for either side to break the deadlock. Burnley came closest when Brady kissed the crossbar with a free-kick. A lot to play for in the second half, so stay tuned."
45'+1',yellow-card,Yellow Card Stephen Ward. We belatedly have the first booking of the game just before half-time as Ward is booked. I don't think it was for the incident with Barragan though. He looked to have said something after.
45'+1',action,"Remarkably, it all ends in a Boro free-kick, with no other disciplinary action taken."
45',action,"Replays show that Barragan and Ward were both battling for position from that corner. The Boro full-back shoves away the Burnley man, who retaliates with a rough barge that drops him."
43',action,"A rare sighting of Brady wins Burnley a corner, which ends with Barragan down on the goal line clutching his face. Now then, the referee has a big decision to make."
41',action,"Gestede gets fouled by Mee, leading to a promising free-kick for the home side. Leadbitter floats it in and Ayala tries to head it back into the danger area, but Burnley get it clear."
38',action,"Leadbitter sprays a wonderful ball down the right flank, and he's unlucky that Clayton wasn't able to get the right touch on it to keep it in play. The Boro right flank continues to look promising."
35',action,"Ayala is in the thick of things once again with Barnes, as the pair clash when battling for an aerial ball. There looked to be a bit of an elbow from the Burnley man, however unintentional."
33',action,"A few half-chances in the past few minutes as this game looks to finally be opening up. The referee then has to keep a lid on things between Ayala and Barnes, who both got into a little scuffle."
30',action,"Barragan has been the most active Boro player on the pitch, and he sends in another testing ball that is still asking a little too much of Gestede at the near post. His glanced header bobbles wide."
27',action,"Lowton drives a good cross into the area that Boyd, back on his feet, controls at the near post perhaps unintentionally. He never looked composed though, and lashes a wild one over the top."
25',action,"Downing loses his initial marker with what looks like a quick turn ofp ace, but he lets the ball run away from him. Boyd is across to clean up, but he's clattered by the winger, who escapes with only a lecture."
22',action,"Gestede does well to take control of a difficult ball but as he attempts to pull it out of his own feet and set up a teammate, he loses his balance under pressure. No penalty, despite his appeals."
19',action,"It's already shaping up to be an interesting battle between Barragan and Ward out on the right. Both players collide on the edge of the area, which has left the Burnley man a little worse for wear."
16',action,"This match has all the makings of a slow burner. Burnley are playing more confidently, trying to isolate their forwards with quick, deep balls out of the back."
13',action,"Burnley line up a free-kick right on the edge of the area which Brady takes, but it clips the top of the bar on its way out! The Clarets' record signing is appealing for a corner, but no dice."
10',action,"Brady goes in carelessly on Leadbitter, leading to a free-kick for Boro that ends a spell of Burnley pressure. Moments later, Downing flights in another good ball, but it's defended well."
7',action,"Barnes leads Burnley's first foray into the opposition half, racing through the centre and holding off one challenge, but then going down too easily as the defence collapses around him."
5',action,"Good start this from the home side, although as I say that, they slide a routine pass out of play for a throw-in inside their own half. Burnley have been mostly playing off the ball so far."
3',action,"Downing hoists in an inviting ball towards the back post, where Barragan was too slow to attack the ball. There was space for the full-back to steal in there and make contact."
1',action,Off we go!
,action,"Adama Traore and Marten de Roon are replaced by Grant Leadbitter and Adam Forshaw in the Middlesbrough team, while Alvaro Negredo's goal against Hull is also not enough to keep him in the XI, with Cristhian Stuani in attack instead."
,action,"Steen Defour's return to the XI ends as quickly as it began, as an injury during his first start in two months against Stoke rules him out. Robbie Brady will play in his place, with Sam Vokes also making way for Ashley Barnes."
,action,"Burnley subs: Flanagan, Vokes, Westwood, Tarowski, Pope, Agyei, Arfield."
,action,"Burnley (4-4-2): Heaton; Lowton, Keane, Mee, Ward; Boyd, Hendrick, Barton, Brady; Barnes, Gray."
,action,"Middlesbrough subs: Negredo, Fischer, Guzan, De Roon, Bamford, Fry, Traore."
,action,"Middlesbrough (3-5-2): Valdes; Espinosa, Ayala, Gibson; Barragan, Leadbitter, Clayton, Forshaw, Downing; Stuani, Gestede."
,action,"Burnley beat Stoke 1-0 last time out, which was enough for their first win in over a month that also halted a glacial slip down the standings. Still, with a seven point cushion on the bottom three, you would expect the Clarets to be playing Premier League football next season."
,action,"Middlesbrough are seven points from safety, although they do have a game in hand on Hull in 17th place. The Tigers were also their most recent opponents, but they went down 4-2 at the KC Stadium."
