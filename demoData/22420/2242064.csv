88',goal,Goal Bamidele Alli. GOAL! Tottenham get their equaliser and it's fortunate. A deflected shot from Eriksen falls kindly for Alli as the England international stabs home.

78',yellow-card,Yellow Card Eric Dier. Dier gets a yellow for a foul on Ki.

76',action,"McBurnie gets himself in the thick of the action as he picks up on a loose ball from Walker to find Sirgursson, but the Iceland international was unable to feed the striker with his pass back."
75',substitution,Substitution sub-out Jordan Ayew sub-in Oliver McBurnie . McBurnie comes on for Ayew.
74',action,Once again the long-ranged effort from Tottenham was poor and offered nothing as Eriksen fired over the crossbar. It's poor decision making from the away side now which is building their frustration.
72',substitution,Substitution sub-out Kyle Naughton sub-in Sung-Yeung Ki . Ki comes on for Naughton who appears to have a knock.
72',action,"Tottenham once again are being reduced to long shots as Son tried his luck but Fabianski gathers with ease. They may not wish to, but the Londoners have to be more patient."
70',action,"It's going to be a long twenty minutes for the final whistle, but Swansea's concentration levels cannot be faultered in this second half as they've dealt with everything that's been thrown at them."
68',action,"Swansea are sitting very deep, but the second Tottenham approach the edge of the box the hosts are pouncing with aggressive pressing but it is leaving space out on the wings for the away side to use."

63',action,"Swansea are doing well here to reduce Tottenham to few chances this half, but it's about now where the visitors will be committing more men forward to the attack."
61',substitution,Substitution sub-out Moussa Sissoko sub-in Vincent Janssen . First sub of the match as Janssen is introduced for SIssoko.
61',action,"Tottenham's frustration may be starting to show as Dier unleashes a strike from range despite only having a bit of room. Whilst he connected well with the effort, it was well wide of Fabianski's goal."
59',action,STAT: Swansea City have the worst defence in the Premier League conceding 63 goals this season.
56',action,CLOSE! Swansea almost double their lead as Mawson switches the play to Naughton and the full-back cuts inside and shoots but Davies does well to get a foot on the effort and it goes out for a corner.
54',action,"Tottenham are recycling the ball around the Swansea box as Alli, Eriksen and co. wait for the perfect opportunity to play the killer pass and cut open the home side."
52',action,Tottenham are looking to maintain their momentum by applying pressure on the hosts and the away side win a corner as an effort from range by Alli is blocked by Naughton.
50',action,"More cries for a penalty, but this time it's Tottenham! Son's effort at the back post is blocked at point-blank range from Fernandez, but once again the referee waves away the appeals."

46',action,Swansea get the second half underway!
,action,"Half-time! Swansea lead going into the break, but Tottenham have been the better side without the cutting edge. Clement has some tweaking to do if the hosts want all the points, but it's the visitors with it all to do."
45',action,The concern for Swansea in this half has to be the amount of space Alli keeps on finding himsself in. If the hosts continue to allow such a creative player time on the ball they will end up getting punished.
43',action,"CHANCE! Eriksen with a fantastic pass to Davies allows the full-back to cut the play back to Son, but the striker was unable to direct it goal-bound as it flies over Fabianski's crossbar."
41',action,"Spurs appeared to be in a great position, but just minutes after providing a great pass Alli's ball to Son was too powerful and it left the South Korean stretching to cross into the box."
39',action,"Good vision from Alli found Davies on the left flank, but the delivery into the box from the full-back was tame and Fernandez was able to volley the ball clear without any pressure from a Tottenham player."
37',action,Swansea are enjoying a better spell of the ball in the last few minutes and the home support are reacting by turning up the noise levels inside the Liberty Stadium before half-time.
35',action,"CHANCE! Ayew once again peels off from the Tottenham defence and Sigurdsson was unmarked in the middle, but the delivery from the striker was poor and Vorm was able to gather."
33',action,"Swansea's chances are few and far between, but the one person who seems to be at the focal point of all of them is Ayew as the striker battles for every ball he gets a sniff of."
31',action,Swansea are starting to play further up the field when Tottenham shift the ball back now and they're managing to catch Spurs forwards offside.
29',action,"CHANCE! A long ball forward from Dier, showing fantastic vision, gives Sissoko the opportunity to bring the play down in the Swansea box, but the Frenchman was unable to do so and it goes out for a goal kick."
27',action,"Son's touch hasn't quite been there tonight, demonstrated again as Walker drilled a ball into the feet of the South Korean but it bounced away from the striker and away from danger."
25',action,"Swansea have dropped five or ten yards deeper here, but it's not helping them offer and relief of pressure. When they hack the ball away, it only allows Tottenham to restart and build again."
23',action,The atmosphere inside the Liberty Stadium is rather poor at the moment as the home fans clearly feel the pressure coming from the visitors. Something needs to change soon from the Swans otherwise we may see an equaliser.
21',action,"Whilst it is Swansea who lead, Tottenham are scampering over the Swans currently as the possession stats read kindly in their favour at 75% for the Londoners."
19',action,CLOSE! Alli tries to add another fantastic goal to his highlight reel but an overhead kick from the England midfielder goes just wide of Fabianski's post.

17',action,STAT: Tottenham have picked up more points from going behind than any other team in the Premier League this season.
15',action,Swansea still look shaky at the back as Sissoko almost finds Eriksen in the box and then Walker whips a fantastic cross into the middle but Alli and Son were nowhere to be found.
13',action,"Tottenham will be exceptionally annoyed with the goal they conceded, not just because it was poor defending but only one minute beforehand they dealt with three corners brilliantly."
11',assist,Assist Jordan Ayew. Ayew done all the work for this goal by breaking onto Fabianski's pass and getting to the byline and finding Routledge in the middle despite pressure from Davies.
11',goal,Goal Wayne Routledge. GOAL! A ambitious long ball forward from Fabianksi is pumped towards Ayew and the forward used his pace to find Routledge in the box and put Swansea in the lead.
11',action,"Swansea earn their first corner of the match as a threatening free-kick from Sigurdsson is turned behind by Dier, but the delivery into the box was headed clear by Davies."
9',action,"Tottenham can sense Swansea are feeling a bit shaky and are attempting to press high to make the hosts feel uncomfortable, but the Swans are starting to get a hold in this match."
7',action,CHANCE! Swansea are really under pressure here and have Fernandez to thank for keeping the scores level. Sissoko and Son broke clear of the home side's defence but the defender makes a vital tackle to stop the South Korean from shooting.
5',action,A brief stoppage in play as Cork receives treatment as Fer clears a corner acrobatically but kicks his teammate in the head in the process. It appears as if he'll be good to continue.
3',action,A sloppy pass from Fer in midfield almost presented a fantastic opportunity to Tottenham in the opening stages as Son tried to find Eriksen in the box but he couldn't pick out his teammate.
1',action,Tottenham get the match underway!
,action,"Just five minutes until kick-off! The fans are in their seats, the players are in the tunnel and the atmosphere is building. Not long now."

,action,CONFIRMED TEAM NEWS
,action,"Meanwhile, Tottenham will be hoping to benefit from Cheslea failing to win on the weekend and hosting Manchester City tonight, but with just one win in their last five matches on the road, coming at Championship side Fulham, this may not be as easy as they hope."
,action,"Swansea head into this match with an impressive record at home, beating Burnley, Leicester City and Southampton in their last three outings, so Paul Clement side has every right to go into this fixture with an air of belief about themselves."
