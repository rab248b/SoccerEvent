,action,"West Brom looked far better in the second half - and particularly after the inclusion of Brunt and McClean - but they just couldn't find a way through a resolute Southampton defence. In many ways, the visitors pulled off a very West Brom-esque performance to frustrate the home side, who leave pointless after failing to get the better of Forster."
,action,FULL-TIME: WEST BROMWICH ALBION 0-1 SOUTHAMPTON
90'+5',action,"Another brilliant stop by Forster! West Brom win themselves a corner with what will surely be the final attack of the afternoon, but, once again, Forster throws out a hand to deny Evans from close range. He really has been excellent today."
90'+4',action,"Excellent interception from Yoshida! Brunt swings a really dangerous into the box and towards Rondon, but this time it's Yoshida who deals with the danger with a fantastic header at the vital moment."
90'+3',yellow-card,Yellow Card Fraser Forster. Yellow card Fraser Forster
90'+2',action,"What a save by Forster! West Brom push forward once again and win themselves a free-kick just inside the Southampton half of the pitch. It's swung into the penalty area and bounces into the path of Dawson, whose thumping volley from close range is somehow stopped by an excellent diving save from Forster."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be five minutes of added time.
89',action,"Another ball is thumped up towards the Southampton penalty area and into the path of Rondon. The Venezuelan does well to reach it under pressure but can't pick out a team-mate, as he's closed down by black shirts and easily dispossessed."
87',action,"Another attempted West Brom attacking move comes to an end, allowing Southampton to break forward on a rare counter-attack. Long is quickly dispossessed, however, and the home side come back once again, but they're unable to make it count as a misplaced pass rolls past Brunt and out for a throw-in."
85',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Jordy Clasie sub-in Harrison Reed . Clasie, who seems to have picked up a slight injury, limps off the pitch to be replaced by sub-in Harrison Reed in Southampton's third and final switch."
84',action,"The West Brom fans are fuming after the referee brought an end to an attack from the hosts to allow Hojbjerg to receive treatment. The Danish midfielder went down off the ball as the home side pushed forward, and, despite initially looking to be in pain, he should be able to continue."
82',action,"Ball after ball is being flung into the Southampton penalty area as West Brom desperately try to find a late equaliser, but the visitors are dealing with everything that's being thrown at them. Forster has performed really well this afternoon, especially when having to deal with looping crosses into the box."
80',action,"Huge chance for Robson-Kanu! Once again, McClean causes problems for the Southampton defence before firing a cross into the penalty area. It looks set to find Rondon but is clawed away by Forster, and Robson-Kanu then fires his follow-up volley high and wide of its intended target."
78',action,"McClean, who has impressed since coming off the substitutes' bench, twists and turns over on the left flank before managing to swing a cross into the box. There are plenty of Southampton players back to deal with the danger though, and it's Stephens who meets the ball well at the near post."
76',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Cédric Ricardo Alves Soares. Chadli tries to break away on a quick counter-attack down the left wing after the corner is cleared, but Cedric cynically drags him to the ground and receives a yellow card as a result."
75',action,"Sims does well to burst deep down the right flank before winning a corner for the visitors. It's sent into a dangerous position but fails to find Evans, who clears the danger with a strong header on the edge of the six-yard box."
73',action,"Long makes a real nuisance of himself deep down the left wing before being bundled over by Nyom, resulting in a free-kick for Southampton in a good position. It's fired into the hosts' box and back towards the striker, but it flies a yard or so over his head before the referee's whistle blows for a foul on a West Brom player."
72',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Nathan Redmond sub-in Joshua Sims . And the second is Josh Sims, who takes the place of Redmond."
72',substitution,"Substitution sub-out James Ward-Prowse sub-in Sam McQueen . Southampton have made a double substitution as they try to find a way back into the game. The first player to come on is sub-in Sam McQueen, who replaces sub-out James Ward-Prowse."
71',action,"Tadic goes a whisker away from making it 2-0! A poor clearance from Foster can only find Tadic, who then cuts inside from the right and unleashes a beautiful shot that beats the goalkeeper before flying just a few inches wide of the top left-hand corner."
70',action,"Big opportunity for Chadli! West Brom keep pushing forward as they desperately try to find a way back into the game. They work the ball around well before Robson-Kanu pokes it back to Chadli, whose first-time shot is sent straight into the hands of Forster."
69',action,"And now Rondon goes close! This time it's McClean who whips a great cross into the Southampton penalty area and on to the head of Rondon, but the striker's effort on goal doesn't have the necessary power to beat Forster in the middle of the goal."
67',action,"Great chance for Redmond! A lovely, curling cross from Cedric is sent deep and picks out Redmond over on the left-hand side of the West Brom box. He quickly unleashes a thumping volley that looks set to find the back of the net, but Foster does well to make sure it doesn't."
66',substitution,Substitution sub-out Darren Fletcher sub-in Hal Robson-Kanu . Fletcher has made way for sub-in Hal Robson-Kanu in a third and final substitution for the home side. Will the Welshman be able to help his side find an equaliser?
64',action,"Great goalkeeping by Forster! A bouncing pass is sent into the middle of the Southampton penalty area and looks set to find McClean in front of goal, but just as he's about to shoot, Forster sticks out a hand to push the ball away from danger."
62',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Matt Phillips sub-in James McClean . West Brom have made a second change as they try to find a way back into the game, with sub-in James McClean coming on to replace Phillips."
62',action,"Nyom weaves his way towards the Southampton penalty area before being bundled over by Bertrand, resulting in a free-kick for West Brom in a promising position. It's fired into the box and is only cleared as far as Jake Livermore, who then blasts his 25-yard strike several yards over the top of the crossbar."
61',action,"A half-hearted West Brom attacking move comes to an end and allows the visitors to counter quickly. Redmond darts through the middle of the pitch on a great run and then sets up Long to his left, but the striker holds on to possession for far too long and and is dispossessed before he can find the Englishman once again."
59',action,"There's a brief moment of concern for Southampton after Long is caught on the back of the head by Dawson as the two battle for the ball, but the Irishman makes a quick recovery and the game gets underway once again."
57',action,"West Brom enjoy a good spell of possession as they work the ball around well midway inside the Southampton half of the pitch. It fails to result in a chance on goal, however, as Rondon is dispossessed as he tries to tee up Chadli."
55',action,"Great interception by Foster! Redmond cuts past Nyom, who is now operating as a right-back, far too easily as he skips in from the left flank. He then fizzes a dangerous cross into the box and towards Long, but Foster sticks out a foot to send the ball away from the striker."
54',action,"Phillips does well to put Cedric under pressure over on the left wing and is brought down for a West Brom free-kick. It's curled into the penalty area by Brunt and finds Rondon, but the striker's downwards header is off target and fails to trouble Forster."
53',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Gareth McAuley sub-in Chris Brunt . West Brom have made their first substitution of the game, with sub-out Gareth McAuley making way for sub-in Chris Brunt, who has immediately slotted in at left-back."
52',action,"Jack Stephens breaks into the West Brom start of the pitch and powers forward before setting up Tadic. The Serbian is in a good position and spins quickly before shooting, but his swerving effort ends up flying a few yards wide of the near post."
51',action,"Redmond, who has arguably been Southampton's best player this afternoon, causes more problems over on the left wing as he tries to cut inside. He's slightly too heavy-handed in his dealing with Dawson though, and he gives away a free-kick before he can penetrate the penalty area."
49',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Matt Phillips. Ouch! Phillips attempts to dispossess Clasie but completely misses the ball before clattering into the Dutchman, leaving the referee with no choice but to show him a yellow card."
47',action,"Early chance for Phillips! A lovely, looping cross from Nyom sails into the heart of the Southampton box and is only cleared as far as Phillips, who quickly unleashes a low shot that is well blocked by the wall of black shirts just in front of him."
46',action,We're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"It hasn't been the best of games for West Brom, who started brightly but have struggled since going behind to a wonderful strike from Clasie. They're being overrun far too easily in the middle of the pitch, where Southampton have looked calm and composed on the ball. Redmond has been particularly impressive for the visitors, whilst Tadic and Long have both started to come into the game as well."
,action,HALF-TIME: WEST BROMWICH ALBION 0-1 SOUTHAMPTON
45'+1',action,"Southampton continue to boss possession as they work the ball around nicely deep down the right flank. Clasie then tries to skip past his marker and into the box, but he loses out and, again, Evans is forced into clearing the danger."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be just one minute of added time.
44',action,"Long almost makes it 2-0! Redmond, who has been excellent so far, makes a nuisance of himself over on the left flank once again before swinging a cross into the penalty area. It flies over to the far post and finds Long, but his diving header ends up bouncing just wide of the goal."
43',action,"Redmond cuts inside from the left wing before teeing up Tadic, who immediately moves the ball on to Cedric. The full-back meets it well before firing a low cross into the West Brom box, where Evans is just about able to get a foot on the ball before it can find Long."
41',action,"West Brom are enjoying a good spell of possession as we near the half-time break, but a promising attacking move is brought to a disappointing end by Dawson, who lets a simple pass roll under his boot and out for a throw-in."
39',action,"What a save by Forster! Chadli sprints down the right flank before picking out Rondon with a beautiful curling cross. It sails right on to the head of the striker, who then nods it towards the roof of the net, but Forster gets a strong hand on the ball to stop it from resulting in an equaliser for the home side."
38',action,"Nyom bursts down the left wing on a great run before trying to fire a cross into the Southampton penalty area and over to Rondon, but before he's able to, he's dispossessed by a great block by Cedric."
37',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Jonny Evans. Redmond twists and turns in the middle of the pitch as he weaves his way towards the West Brom penalty area, where he's clumsily tripped over by Evans and wins the visitors a free-kick in a very dangerous position. Tadic steps up and shoots but his strike is sent straight into the wall."
35',action,"Long is almost set up once again, and this time it comes from a dinked pass forward by Tadic. Evans is there to deal with the danger, however, as he darts in front of the striker before blasting the ball back towards the halfway line."
33',action,"Almost a chance for Long! Bertrand and Redmond link up really well deep down the left flank before the latter chips a lovely cross over to the far post. It looks set to find Long, but Evans is just about able to get a head on the ball before being elbowed in the back by the Irishman."
31',action,"The tables have turned and it's now West Brom who find themselves on the front foot as Southampton sit back and soak up the pressure. Rondon is looking far too isolated up front though, and his team-mates are really struggling to pick him out in front of goal."
29',action,"West Brom push forward on another attack as they try to find a way back into the game, but, once again, Southampton have plenty of bodies back to deal with the danger before Bertrand is fouled by Fletcher as he tries to counter quickly."
27',action,"Evans pushes into the Southampton half of the pitch and down the left channel before trying to tee up Rondon with a curling cross into the middle of the box, but it fails to pick out the striker and is easily headed away by Yoshida."
25',assist,"Assist Dušan Tadić. Tadic did well to pick out Clasie at the end of a well-worked move, but Tony Pulis will be really disappointed with his side, who fell asleep momentarily and were carved apart far too easily."
25',goal,"Goal Jordy Clasie. GOAL! What a strike by Clasie! A thumping pass up the pitch finds Dusan Tadic, who twists and turns well inside the penalty area to shake off his marker. He then pokes the ball back Clasie, who, in an acre of space, is able to rifle in a brilliant shot that flies past Foster and into the top right-hand corner of the net."
24',action,"Phillips flies down the left wing on a wonderful run before cutting into the Southampton box and winning his side another corner. This time Jonny Evans goes down after tangling with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, but the referee waves away his half-hearted pleas for a penalty and allows the corner to sail out of play for a goal-kick."
23',action,"Dawson links up well with Morrison before trying to swing a cross towards Rondon, but it deflects off Bertrand and out for a corner. Chadli steps up and curls the ball into the heart of the box, but it fails to find a West Brom player and is easily cleared by the visitors."
22',action,"Chadli cuts inside from the left flank on a good run before poking a pass into the Southampton penalty area and towards Rondon, but the striker is beaten to the ball by Maya Yoshida, who then blasts it out for a throw-in."
20',action,"Two great chances for West Brom! A lofted pass forward finds Rondon, who immediately nods the ball down to Morrison. The midfielder takes a quick touch before rifling a rocket of a shot, but it's well saved by Fraser Forster. The goalkeeper can only push the ball as far as Chadli, who then smashes his follow-up well wide of the goal."
18',action,"Cedric Soares gets himself into a pocket of space deep down the right flank before curling a cross into the West Brom box and towards Long. It fails to find the Irishman, however, and bounces straight into the hands of Ben Foster."
16',action,"It's been a relatively frustrating start to the game for Southampton, who are having to deal with a very stubborn and well-organised West Brom back line. Bar Long's half-chance earlier in the afternoon, they've created little so far, despite bossing possession."
14',action,"Nacer Chadli flies towards the Southampton penalty area on a mazy run as he tries to find a way through a group of black shirts, but, despite managing to beat two players, he's unable to get a shot away before being dispossessed."
12',action,"Southampton continue to enjoy the vast amount of possession before Clasie gets on to the ball once again, but, as was the case a few minutes ago, the Dutchman's pass forward is poor and fails to pick out a black shirt."
10',action,"Big opportunity for Rondon! A Southampton attack comes to a disappointing end and allows West Brom to counter quickly. Matt Phillips charges down the wing before firing a delightful ball into the path of Rondon, but the striker completely misses the ball before the linesman's flag is correctly raised for offside."
8',action,"Darren Fletcher muscles his way through the middle of the pitch before spraying a nice pass out to Craig Dawson on the right wing. The full-back takes on Ryan Bertrand and just about manages to get the better of the Southampton man, but his final touch lets him down and sends the ball rolling out for a goal-kick."
6',action,"Southampton patiently work the ball around inside the West Brom half of the pitch as they try to carve out an opening. They're unable to do so though, as a misplaced pass from Jordy Clasie can only pick out James Morrison."
4',action,Almost an early chance for Shane Long! Nathan Redmond makes a darting run down the left wing before cutting inside and fizzing a dangerous pass across the face of goal. It looks set to pick out Long before rolls just past the Irishman before being dealt with by Allan Nyom.
3',action,"After an even start to the game from both sides, Salomon Rondon picks up a loose, bouncing ball just outside of the Southampton penalty area and decides to shoot. His strike is completely mishit though and ends up flying nearing to the corner flag than the goal."
1',action,"We're off! West Brom get us underway, attacking from left to right."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."
,action,"Meanwhile, Southampton boss Claude Puel has also made three alterations to the team that featured in their last outing, with Sam McQueen, Steven Davis and Oriol Romeu making way for Ryan Bertrand, Jordy Clasie and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg."
,action,"Tony Pulis has decided to make three changes to the West Brom side that started the defeat away to Watford during the week, with Matt Phillips, James Morrison and Salomon Rondon coming coming into the starting line-up to replace James McClean, Chris Brunt and Hal Robson-Kanu, respectively."
,action,"Southampton substitutes: Hassen, Caceres, McQueen, Reed, Sims, Pied, Rodriguez."
,action,"Southampton XI (4-2-3-1): Forster; Cedric; Stephens, Yoshida, Bertrand; Clasie, Hojbjerg; Ward-Prowse, Tadic, Redmond; Long."
,action,"West Bromwich Albion substitutes: Myhill, Wilson, Field, Yacob, Brunt, McClean, Robson-Kanu."
,action,"West Bromwich Albion XI (4-1-4-1): Foster; Dawson, McAuley, Evans, Nyom; Fletcher; Phillips, Livermore, Morrison, Chadli; Rondon."
,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"Many of West Brom’s troubles can be explained by their struggles up front, where main striker Salomon Rondon has failed to score a single domestic goal since grabbing a hat-trick against Swansea back in December. Veteran centre-back Gareth McAuley is his side’s second-highest goalscorer, highlighting an issue that Tony Pulis will need to fix over the summer."
,action,"With their place in the Premier League confirmed for another season, West Brom have been a little all over the place since reaching that all-important 40-point mark. They memorably beat Arsenal 3-1 three weeks ago but have also lost against Palace, Everton and, most recently, Watford in recent games. As a result, it’s difficult to know what Baggies side will turn up this afternoon."
,action,"After enjoying a positive 2016, this year has been a slightly underwhelming one for Claude Puel’s men, who have struggled to hit the heights of last season. They’ve looked more comfortable in recent weeks, however, and will no doubt be feeling confident about their chances of picking up another win here today against a West Brom team in erratic form."
,action,"With nine points and two games separating Southampton and 18th-place Swansea City, any slight fears that the Saints could get dragged into a last-minute battle to avoid relegation were quelled by Wednesday evening’s win at home to Crystal Palace. As a result, they now sit in ninth place in the table, seven points behind their opponents today but with three victories from their last five league outings."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Premier League game between West Bromwich Albion and Southampton at the Hawthorns.
