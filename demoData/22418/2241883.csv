90'+1',action,We're into three minutes of added time now.
90',action,"Fuchs launches a long throw towards Huth and Morgan in the middle but Gibson gets up well to head the ball clear. The ball drops at the feet of Amartey but this time he doesn’t connect well and the ball goes wide towards Slimani, who’s flagged offside."
88',substitution,Substitution sub-out Gastón Exequiel Ramírez Pereyra sub-in Viktor Fischer . Another change for the visitors now as the impressive Gastón Ramírez is replaced by sub-in Viktor Fischer.
87',action,"Close from Amartey! Fuchs does well to react quickest after Barragan had blocked his initial cross, and knocks the ball to Amartey 30 yards out from goal. The midfielder hits it well but it goes just wide of Valdes’s goal."
84',action,"Close!! Stuani looks to pick out the unmarked Negredo with a low cross towards the back post, but Huth slides in to divert the ball away from the striker just as he’s about to tap the ball in from six yards out."
82',action,"Forshaw lays the ball off to Barragan who has acres of space to pick out a cross from the right hand edge of the box, but Zieler just gets his palm to the ball to tip it away from Stuani and Negredo, who were both unmarked in the middle."
79',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Adama Traoré Diarra sub-in Cristhian Ricardo Stuani Curbelo . A change for Middlesbrough now as Adama Traoré is replaced by their top scorer this season, Cristhian Stuani"
78',action,"Ramirez does really well to win the ball back from Amartey close to the corner flag, but as he tries to wriggle out of the tackle from the midfielder the ball bounces off him and goes out for a Leicester goal-kick."
76',substitution,Substitution sub-out Shinji Okazaki sub-in Demarai Gray . A third and final change now for Leicester as sub-out Shinji Okazaki is replaced by sub-in Demarai Gray.
74',action,"Claudio Ranieri looks furious with his side after that goal, and rightly so as it was all far too easy for Middlesbrough at a time when Leicester were starting to look dangerous."
71',assist,"Assist Adam Forshaw. Forshaw played the long ball over the top but Huth stepped up to try and play Negredo offside, giving the striker a clean run in on goal."
71',goal,Goal Álvaro Negredo Sánchez. GOOOOAAALLLLLLL!!!!!! Negredo puts Middlesbrough back ahead!! Forshaw plays a long ball over the top from inside his own half and the Spaniard latches on to it before drilling the ball across Zieler into the far corner with the outside of his left boot.
69',action,"Slimani gets into a good position on the left hand edge of the penalty area and plays a low cross towards Musa who flicks the ball onto Okazaki, but the striker’s 20-yard shot on the turn is easy enough for Valdes who holds on above his head."
68',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Riyad Mahrez sub-in Ahmed Musa . Another change for Leicester now as sub-in Ahmed Musa comes on to replace Mahrez, who doesn’t look too pleased with that decision."

65',yellow-card,Yellow Card Jamie Vardy. Vardy goes sliding in late on Adam Clayton and receives a yellow card. That looked to be a challenge more out of frustration than anything else.
63',action,A really good passage of play from Leicester as Albrighton skips away from de Roon before spreading the ball wide to Simpson in space on the right. The right-back puts a decent cross into the box but it’s just behind King who can only divert the header well over the bar from 12 yards out.
61',action,"Fabio makes a good run down the left before putting in a deflected cross towards de Roon at the back post. The ball bounces up awkwardly for the midfielder to deal with but he manages to flick it on to Traore, but the winger can only slice his shot well wide of the goal from 10 yards out."
58',action,"De Roon does really well to intercept a clearing header from Huth ahead of Andy King, but unfortunately for Middlesbrough his pass is misplaced and goes straight out for a throw in."
56',action,"Barragan brings down Albrighton in a dangerous area on the left with a needless nudge in the back, but Mahrez fails to beat the first man with the cross from the free-kick and another opportunity to send the big men forward is wasted for Leicester."
54',action,Gibson picks out Fabio in space inside the Leicester half but the left-back has to turn back with very few options in front of him. Neither side seem to want to commit too many men forwards at the start of the second half here.
51',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Daniel Amartey. A good run from Fabio draws the trip from Amartey 40 yards out from goal on the left hand side for which the midfielder is booked. Ramirez whips in the resultant free-kick towards Gibson, but the centre-back can’t get over the ball and it slides off the top off his head out for a goal-kick."

48',action,"Traore shows his pace by getting down the outside of Fuchs and Albrighton on the right hand side, but his touch is just too heavy and the ball goes out for a goal-kick."
46',action,"Bright start for Leicester as Amartey crosses towards Huth, who had stayed forward after a Fuchs long throw, but Chambers and Barragan do well to get either side of the big centre-back and the former heads clear."
46',action,Kick-off! Lee Mason blows his whistle and the second half is underway.
,action,"Claudio Ranieri will be looking for Jamie Vardy to get in behind the Middlesbrough defence more often in the second half as he’s struggled to get into the game so far, while Aitor Karanka will be asking his side to get the ball into the feet of his two pacey wingers, Traore and Ramirez, as often as possible."
,action,Middlesbrough started much the better of the two sides and deservedly took the lead when Alvaro Negredo got his first goal since the opening day of the season.

45',action,Middlesbrough get a free-kick 35 yards out from goal but Ramirez’s cross is a poor one and Morgan can head the ball clear with ease.
42',action,"What a tackle from Ramirez!!! The ball breaks for Okazaki inside the box and the striker opts not to go for goal himself but instead roll the ball across to Vardy who’s unmarked 12 yards out from goal, but the England striker takes too long to take the shot and Ramirez gets back to stick a toe in and divert the ball past his own post."
39',action,Negredo gets up well on halfway to flick the ball on for Ramirez to chase. The winger drives towards the corner of the box but only has Negredo to aim for at the back post and Morgan recovers to intercept the cross and clear the danger.

33',action,PENALTY TO LEICESTER!!
31',yellow-card,Yellow Card Calum Chambers. Calum Chambers goes into the book for putting his arm across Jamie Vardy as he looked to chase a ball over the top.
30',action,"OFF THE BAR!!! Mahrez turns Fabio inside and out before dinking a lovely cross towards Okazaki, who goes for a spectacular bicycle kick only to see it cannon off the cross bar and out for a goal-kick."
29',yellow-card,Yellow Card Marc Albrighton. Ramirez gives away a cheap free-kick for a push on Mahrez close to the right hand touchline. Ben Gibson and Negredo combine to head the ball clear from Albrighton’s cross and as Ramirez looks to counter attack Albrighton cynically pulls him back and is shown the first yellow card of the game.

13',assist,Assist Gastón Exequiel Ramírez Pereyra. Ramirez had acres of space and picked out the centre-forward with a superb low cross.

9',action,"CLOSE!! Traore goes on a wonderful run between Christian Fuchs and Jamie Vardy and into the box. His driven cross is palmed away by Ron-Robert Zieler but only into the path of Marten de Roon on the edge of the box, but his fierce shot goes inches wide of the far post."
