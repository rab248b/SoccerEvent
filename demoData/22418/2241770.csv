,action,"FULL-TIME! Liverpool close out a narrow 2-1 win over Burnley in the Premier League, keeping the pressure firmly on the teams around them in the race for Champions League football. Goals from Wijnaldum and Can wrapped up a comeback, following Barnes' opener in the first half, but the hosts dug deep to navigate their way past a competitive travelling outfit. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+3',action,"Over the top from Lowton! What a chance. A long throw for Burnley causes all kinds of havoc, with the right-back found in space by a nod down from Keane. He shoots from close-range at the back post, but he can't quite keep his effort down."
90'+2',action,"Liverpool are happy to sit deep and absorb the late pressure, as Burnley try to muster up a final bit of creativity at Anfield. The visitors are having a lot of possession, but a cross from Brady is helped away from the danger zone by Matip."
90'+1',action,There are four minutes of second-half stoppage time.
90',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Scott Arfield sub-in Daniel Agyei . Arfield is replaced for the dying moments, with Agyei given a rare opportunity from the bench."
89',action,"Liverpool win themselves a corner on the left-hand side, after good work from Woodburn, but Heaton manages to punch the set piece clear. Only a few minutes remain and Wijnaldum is happy to waste a bit of time near the corner."
87',yellow-card,Yellow Card Adam Lallana. Lallana picks up a yellow card for a cynical foul.
86',action,"The away side are committing a lot of players forward now, with Vokes always the target of their advances. The former Wolves striker manages to tee up Barnes on the edge of the box, but his striker partner is unable to get a shot away."
84',action,"Liverpool are happy to keep the ball and try to wind the clock down, as Burnley are very much still in this game and still threatening sporadically. Vokes is looking to make a nuisance of himself with his huge frame. Clyne shows the hosts' mood, taking a long, long time to take a throw-in."
82',action,"Vokes manages to get the wrong side of Matip, after a mistake from the former Schalke centre-back, but the Cameroon international recovers very well to deny the Burnley substitute from delivering from the left byline. The visitors are cranking the pressure up."
80',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Andre Gray sub-in Sam Vokes . Gray is replaced by Vokes up top for Burnley, as Dyche's men look to go long and pump route-one balls up to the Welsh target man."
79',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Divock Okoth Origi sub-in Lucas Pezzini-Leiva . Lucas is the next man to be brought into the fray for Liverpool, with Origi taking his leave. Klopp is shutting up shop."
77',action,"Liverpool are willing to pump the ball upfield with a little less quality in these later stages, as Burnley try to work their way back into the equation. Dyche's men are seeing more possession, with their full-backs pushing on. Lowton attempts to bend in a cross to the back post, but Brady can't get anywhere near it."
75',action,"Burnley work the ball from right to left, but they're unable to go anywhere fast with it. A long ball searches for Barnes over the top, but Clyne tucks in to make a good defensive header. Moments later, Origi is penalised for jumping unfairly with Mee. Any set-piece opportunity now sees the away side load the box."
73',substitution,"Substitution sub-out George Boyd sub-in Robbie Brady . Â Brady is introduced for the away side, with Boyd taking his leave. The Irishman offers a little more quality in terms of deliveries and set-pieces."
71',action,"Woodburn drops a shoulder and cuts in from the left-hand side, before flighting a cross directly out of play on the far side. If Origi had peeled off his man a little more, that could have been a threatening chance. Burnley aren't offering as much going forward in this game now."
69',action,"Mignolet is forced to punch clear from a looping free-kick delivery from Burnley, with the goalkeeper then fouled by Mee. The visiting centre-back only had eyes for the ball, but it appears that their collosion has knocked the wind out of both of them."
67',action,"Dyche is trying to get his players motivated and firing again, but Can's strike has taken the wind out of their sails a little. Barnes and Gray haven't had a chance to truly link up in this second half, with Liverpool starting to dictate the midfield battle with a bit more ease."
65',action,"Liverpool are now the side looking to slow down the game somewhat, with Can's strike taking a weight off their shoulders. Origi threatens to skip in behind the visiting back four, but Keane easily eases the Belgian out of the way to take control of the situation."
63',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Emre Can. Anfield is suddenly in much better voice, with the ball now in Burnley's court in terms of finding a goal. Can gets a booking for a cynical challenge. Barnes has a shot blocked from close-range from the resulting free-kick."
61',assist,Assist Divock Okoth Origi. Origi spots Can in a pocket of space and invites him to try his luck.
61',goal,"Goal Emre Can. GOOOOOOOOOAL! CAN MAKES IT 2-1! Out of nowhere, the hosts have the lead for the first time this afternoon. Origi opens play out to the edge of the box, urging his German teammate forward on the edge of the area. The ex-Leverkusen utility man races forward and lashes a low finish into the bottom-right corner!"
60',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Philippe Coutinho Correia sub-in Ben Woodburn . Coutinho is replaced by Woodburn for the last half an hour, after offering very little across a quiet performance."
60',action,"Coutinho forces a rushed clearance behind for a corner, after dipping in a fantastic delivery from the right. Liverpool can't make the most of the dead-ball situation yet again, but they are cranking up the pressure gradually. A substitution might need to be in the offing."
58',yellow-card,Yellow Card Joey Barton. Hendrick picks up the first yellow card of the second half.
57',action,"Gray is the target of a long ball over the top, after yet another Liverpool attack breaks down, but Matip has the pace to shield the pass back to Mignolet. The hosts head up the other end, but Mee is once again alert to deny a burst forward from Coutinho. Narrowly over half an hour remains for a winning goal at Anfield."
55',action,"Klavan is forced to lift a hurried clearance away from the danger zone, after Barnes broke down the left-hand side at pace. Ward launches a long throw into the area, with Matip only managing to head half-clear, leading to Barnes lashing a terrible effort high and wide of the target from close range."
54',action,"Ward makes a vital interception inside his own box to deny Origi, after some great work down the right from Clyne. Liverpool are trying to be positive, but Burnley's shape and organisation is making them very hard to play through."
52',action,"The referee continues to be very keen to clamp down on niggling offences in the middle of the park, leading to the tempo of this contest slowing considerably. Burnley are happy to just keep kicking long, but Matip has the measure of Barnes and Gray aerially."
50',action,"Liverpool are desperate to force the issue and carry their momentum over from the very end of the first half, but Burnley are doing well to win free-kicks in the midfield third to just slow everything down a little. Arfield has a half-chance to shoot on the edge of the box, but slices at his attempt."
48',action,"Both goalkeepers have been called into action in the early minutes, as both sides continue to craft their best opportunities on the break when there are pockets of space to exploit. Burnley are keeping a lot of players behind the ball, however, with their front two pressing well."
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half at Anfield! Liverpool manage to get out of jail in the first half courtesy of a late Wijnaldum strike, but they aren't out of the woods yet by any means."
,action,"HALF-TIME! Liverpool manage to get back onto level terms at the very death, with Wijnaldum cancelling out an early opener from Barnes. Burnley have defended well and haven't looked to be troubled too often, meaning Klopp will want plenty of improvement after the break if they're to turn this game on its head entirely."
45'+1',goal,"Goal Georginio Wijnaldum. GOOOOOOOOOOAL! WIJNALDUM MAKES IT 1-1! The Dutchman continues to impress at home in the Premier League! A cross from the left is swung in by Origi, with a bit of miscontrol from the ex-Newcastle midfielder actually aiding his cause. The rebound falls kindly and Wijnaldum slams home - he couldn't miss from there!"
45'+1',action,There is one minute of stoppage time at Anfield.
45',action,"Heaton is forced into a save at last, but it is Barton who works his own teammate! A cross from the right is flighted in and met by the ex-Rangers midfielder's head, but the deflection doesn't quite wrongfoot his own goalkeeper. Close escape."
43',action,"Milner is picked out in space out on the left-hand side, but Mee does well to outjump Origi and flick the eventual delivery from the Englishman behind for a corner - or so it would appear. The linesman gives a goal-kick. Liverpool are running of time to reply this side of half-time."
41',action,"Clyne drives down the right and then cuts inside to approach the box. As he attempts to stab a pass into a teammate in a better position, he overruns his next touch and Lowton makes an interception. Liverpool work the ball from right to left, before a curling cross from Milner is flicked on by Origi and then claimed by Heaton."
39',action,"Liverpool will be desperate to get on the scoresheet before the break, but Burnley are running down the clock quite well. The hosts have retained the ball a little better since going behind, but the likes of Origi and Coutinho have been incredibly quiet."
37',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ben Mee. Mee picks up a yellow card after hacking down Lallana, as the England international looked to spin away from his man."
36',action,"Coutinho finds Mane in the midfield third, with the Senegalese winger then bursting down the flank. Arfield stands him up, however, before putting in a very good tackle. Burnley are weathering this pressure from Liverpool rather easily."
34',action,"Around 10 minutes remain in this first half, with Burnley still looking the more dangerous of the two sides when they do actually get forward. Mane tries to lead a break for the home side, but the Liverpool winger is prompted mobbed by sky blue shirts. Origi spins on the edge of the box and tries to whip in a cross, but Lowton denies him."
32',action,"Arfield concedes a corner, but Boyd lashes a near-post clearance away from the danger zone. Liverpool keep their pressure on, with Matip putting the ball back into the box towards Origi, but Heaton collects with consummate ease. Moments later, Barnes vyes to get in behind Klavan, but the Estonian defender does just enough to put the ball into touch."
30',action,"Milner is fed down the left-hand side, but Lowton covers across to make a good block and concede a corner. Coutinho bends in an inswinger from the left-hand side, but Mane is unable to make the most of the delivery into the back post. Klopp isn't looking impressed whatsoever in his technical area, Liverpool have been dismal."
28',action,"Keane makes a good intervention to deny a cut-back from the right wing, before Barton makes a timely block to protect Heaton from a powerful 20-yard effort. Liverpool are starting to see more of the ball and build up a bit of momentum, but the England international goalkeeper hasn't been forced into a tough save yet."
26',action,"Half-chance for Gray! A long throw from Lowton is brought down by the Burnley striker, who then spins quickly to get beyond Matip. He shoots from a very, very narrow angle, sending the ball sailing wide of the target. Lax defending once again from the Reds."
25',action,"Liverpool win a free-kick deep on the right, but Mee rises highest to direct the lofted delivery behind for a corner. Coutinho takes from the same flank, but it goes short, before an eventual cross into the Burnley box is met by a composed defender. Everything is looking very simple for Dyche's men to deal with."
23',action,"Heaton is being kept busy, but only to come out to easily claim terrible throughballs from the hosts. Origi hasn't had anything to do, aside from chase lost causes. Burnley are retaining their shape well and making it very difficult for Liverpool to create anything of note."
22',action,"Just wide from Barnes! Ward whips in a brilliant cross from the left-hand side, but the Burnley goalscorer can only stroke a volley beyond the right-hand post. The linesman's flag was raised for offside anyway, but Liverpool need to be concerned."
20',action,"Mane gets in behind Barton and bursts down the right-hand side, but a cross from the ex-Southampton wide man is cut out brilliantly by Mee who concedes a corner. Liverpool whip their first set-piece in towards the near post, but it is cleared behind, before the second results in a hurried clearance from Boyd. Third time isn't lucky either, as Keane clears."
18',action,"Lowton tries to bend in a cross from the right-hand side, but Milner makes a good block, before Liverpool gift possession away yet again. Klopp's men have no control in the centre of the park, with Burnley managing to battle their way upfield against a reluctant home outfit. Dyche will be overjoyed."
16',action,"Matip makes a vital interception to deny Gray the chance to race into the clear once again, with Burnley still baring their teeth despite taking the lead. Boyd goes down with an injury, after being caught late in the centre of midfield by Can."
14',action,"Chance for Origi! Mane is fed down the right-hand side and drives to the byline, before clipping a dangerous cross in from the flank. The Belgium international is present at the back post, but can't quite stretch enough to nod home unmarked. That was a matter of inches from an equaliser."
12',action,"The resulting free-kick from Can's shove is blasted wide by Boyd, with Klopp unsurprisingly looking rather frustrated on the sideline for the hosts. There have been absolutely no positives to their play so far, with the likes of Mane and Origi getting no service in dangerous areas of the field."
11',action,"Boyd is fouled around 30 yards from goal, following a push from Can, with Burnley continuing to put the early pressure on. Liverpool are just playing themselves into trouble and making it very easy for the away side to find space in between the lines."
9',action,"The away side are looking good so far, with Heaton being protected well and Gray and Barnes causing real chaos on the break. It is a mirror image of what happened at Turf Moor, really, with Klopp's men not learning from their past experience."
7',assist,Assist Matthew Lowton. Lowton looks up and then bends in an inviting cross to the back stick.
7',goal,"Goal Ashley Barnes. GOOOOOOOAL! BARNES MAKES IT 1-0! Liverpool just keep allowing their opponents to get in behind. A wonderful ball from deep on the right-hand side is curled into the penalty area, with the Burnley striker able to slide in a stab home a finish at the back post."
7',action,"Gray is released down the right-hand side and tries to cut a cross into the box for his striker partner, but a delivery into the area zips way beyond Barnes. Moments later, the same man is sent through on goal for Burnley, but this time a back-post cross from the English striker is headed clear by Matip."
5',action,"Burnley win themselves a corner from Klavan out on the right-hand side, with the set piece half-cleared. The rebound falls to Boyd on the edge of the box, but the visiting winger lashes a half-volleyed effort narrowly over the crossbar. Mignolet was worried there for a second."
4',action,"The home side enjoy all of the ball early in this clash, with Mee and Keane already forced to make interventions deep within their own penalty area. Barnes is picked out by a long kick forward from Heaton, before holding it up well and playing a one-two. Just when he appeared ready to shoot, Milner covers across."
2',action,"Mane is the target of a quick ball over the top in the opening stages, but Mee manages to flick a defensive header back to Heaton. Burnley will look to keep things tight and hit Liverpool on the break, as they did when the Clarets triumphed over today's opponents at Turf Moor earlier in the season."
1',action,"We are underway in the first half at Anfield! Liverpool have a few injury absentees, but they will still be hoping to put a Burnley side to the sword who don't travel well in the Premier League. A place in the top four is an stake."
