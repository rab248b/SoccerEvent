,action,"That's all from us today folks, we hope you enjoyed the game!"

,action,"It's a second successive 3-1 win for Leicester, who move five points clear of the relegation places. The Foxes gained a vital victory over their relegation rivals, the hosts went behind early on, but they hit back through Fuchs, then Mahrez and an own goal seal a huge win"

,action,FULL-TIME: LEICESTER 3-1 HULL

90'+3',action,That's the full-time whistle!

90',own-goal,"Own Goal Tom Huddlestone ; IT'S 3-1! Huddlestone puts the ball into the back of his own net! Leicester have surely sealed all three points now. Albrighton whipped the corner in and Huddlestone tried to clear the ball away, but he puts the ball past Jakupovic under pressure from Huth!"

89',yellow-card,Yellow Card Tom Huddlestone ; Huddlestone is the first Hull player to be given a yellow card for a late challenge.

87',action,"Niasse hits the side netting after meeting Grosicki's cross at the far post. The Leicester keeper sees the ball go wide. Hull are getting closer, but just not close enough at the moment."

86',action,"Hull are throwing everything at Leicester at the moment, trying to go forward at every opportunity but the Foxes are doing well defensively, not allowing them any clear chances at goal."

84',save,"GOOD SAVE! Schmeichel denies Niasse at his near post. The Hull striker did well to work himself some space and take a shot at goal, but the Foxes keeper gets down well to his right to make the save. The resulting corner comes to nothing."

83',substitution,; The man who looks to have scored the winning goal is off and on in his place is Islam Slimani.

80',action,"The Foxes haven't won successive Premier League matches since April 2016, but they are on course to do that once again today, as they still lead 1-0 with ten minutes left to play."

78',substitution,"; Here comes another Hull substitution, Lazar Marković is off and Adama Diomande replacing him. Hull now have three strikers on the pitch."

77',action,Hull keep pushing forward and look threatening but once again their final ball is missing. Not long to go now for them to grab an equalising goal.

75',block,"Drinkwater slides a great ball in behind the Hull defence for Vardy to run on to, but Ranocchia gets there ahead of Vardy and makes an excellent sliding tackle to deny the England striker the chance to shot at goal."

74',action,"Excellent play by Maguire to bring the ball out of defensive and create an attack, he gets as far as the edge of the box before playing the ball to Grosicki down the left, however the cross is a poor one and Leicester are able to clear the danger."

72',action,"Despite enjoying the vast majority of possession at the moment, Hull are struggling to carve out any real chances but they are forcing Leicester to sit deeper and deeper and the hosts are starting to invite pressure on themselves."

70',substitution,"; Leicester respond by making a substitution of their own with Shinji Okazaki the man coming off, to be replaced by Demarai Gray."

68',substitution,"; Hull make the first substitution of the game and it is an attacking one, with Alfred N'Diaye coming off to be replaced by striker, Abel Hernández."

66',action,"Looks like Hull might be about to make their first substitution of the game, they need to change something if they are to get back into this game."

64',action,"Riyad Mahrez has now scored in four of his five appearances against Hull City in all competitions, though three were scored away from home, so todays goal is his first against the Tigers at the King Power Stadium."

62',save,"A huge blow to Hull who have performed well so far in the second half, having a few good chances. Grosicki has just forced Schmeichel into making a good save from a fierce free-kick. The visitors are still in this game."

59',goal,"Goal Riyad Mahrez ; GOOOAAALLL! MAHREZ! The winger has been lively all game and he beats Robertson and Maguire with his trickery, switches the ball back onto his right and fires a low shot at goal which beats Jakupovic at his near post. Perhaps the Hull keeper should’ve done better with that attempt, he doesn’t look pleased with conceding that goal."

57',action,"Simpson finds plenty of time and space so he tries his luck from long-range, his low shot is saved by Jakupovic but the Hull keeper almost spills the ball into the net!"

55',chance,"CHANCE HULL! Clucas does brilliantly to beat Ndidi after getting to the byline, he then cuts back onto his favoured left-foot and shoots at goal, but his shot lacks any real power and Leicester are able to clear. Perhaps Clucas should've played the ball to Niasse who was making a late run into the box."

54',action,"Hull are the better team at the moment, they have improved a lot from how they finished the first half. The two best chances failing to Maguire, plus they have plenty of pace going forward which is causing the Leicester defence problems."

53',action,"This is the fourth Premier League meeting between the teams, with both sides claiming one victory each in the three previous games. With Hull beating the reigning Premier League champions on the opening day of this season, back in August."

50',chance,"CHANCE HULL! Another good opportunity by the visitors at the start of this half, Maguire once again doing well in the air and getting a free header at goal, but his attempt is straight at Schmeichel, who makes a comfortable save."

49',yellow-card,Yellow Card Danny Drinkwater ; Danny Drinkwater is the first player to receive a yellow card for a blatant pull on Huddlestone in midfield.

48',action,"OFF THE POST! Maguire goes so close to giving Hull the lead again! The Tigers win a corner early on and Maguire rises highest and meets the ball well, aiming his header low towards the corner of the goal, but it goes inches the wrong side! Kasper Schmeichel had no chance."

46',action,The second half is underway!

,action,"Hull took the lead through Sam Clucas after a good counter-attack. However Leicester, inspired by the impressive Jamie Vardy, equalised through Christian Fuchs not long after. It's honours even at the break, but can either side push on to grab all three points in the second-half?"

,action,HALF-TIME: LEICESTER 1-1 HULL

45'+1',action,That's the half-time whistle!

45',action,There will be a minimum of one minute added time played here.

44',action,"Grosicki onces again breaks on the counter down the left for Hull, pulls the ball back for Robertson but his ball into the box is too heavy and misses all of his teammates in the box. Both teams are just lacking the final ball at the moment."

41',action,This will be nervous viewing for Hull supporters at the moment as their side struggle to clear the lines. The Tigers need to stay tight until half-time at least. Despite their pressure Leicester need to be aware of the counter-attacking threats that Hull can cause them. Grosicki wins a corner after a long ball downfield. Leicester clear the danger.

39',chance,"Mahrez looks very keen to impress today, he has been influential down both wings so far for Leicester. The winger cut inside from the right and whipped a cross into the box which Robertson had to put behind his own goal for a corner. Hull deal with the corner, but Leicester keep on coming."

37',action,Mahrez tries to feed Simpson into the box but Grosicki makes sure he does he defensive duties and gets back to put the ball out for a throw-in. Good defending by Hull from the throw-in sees them win a goal-kick. Can either side create a goal-scoring opportunity before the half-time whistle and put themselves in the driving seat?

35',action,"Hull really are struggling to keep possession of the ball now, they are unable to string more than three or four passes together at the moment which is playing straight into Leicester's hands."

33',action,"Vardy and Albrighton almost link up again! Vardy gets away from Maguire and lofts a cross across the face of the goal, aiming for Albrighton but the winger is not quick enough and the chance goes amiss. Vardy has been excellent so far here for Leicester. Looking dangerous every time he picks up the ball."

32',action,The home fans are now in fine voice with the scores now level. The goal has given Leicester a huge lift!

30',action,"Hull have struggled to keep the ball since they took the lead early on, now with Leicester's equaliser it may force them to start playing their football again. The likes of Huddlestone and Clucas are unable to get a real grip on the game for the Tigers."

27',assist,"Assist Jamie Vardy ; Very good link-up play between Fuchs and Vardy, they were certainly on the same wavelength then! Vardy turning provider for his teammate to score the equalising goal."

27',goal,"Goal Christian Fuchs ; GOOOAAALLL! LEICESTER EQUALISE! Christian Fuchs get the ball deep in the Hull half, he plays it to Vardy who sprints down the wing and then pulls a perfect ball back to Fuchs who made a superb run. The left-back then slots the ball into the back of the net with ease, giving Eldin Jakupovic no chance to save it."

26',action,"Lazar Markovic plays a sloppy ball in midfield, aiming for Huddlestone but it is nowhere near his skipper and Leicester can try and mount a counter-attack."

24',action,"Grosicki breaks forward down the left once again, however it is good defending from Simpson who forces him back to Robertson. Leicester then put good pressure on the Hull backline and force a throw-in. Both sides struggling to create any goal-scoring chances at the moment though."

22',action,"Hull look full of confidence at the moment, it is remarkable how different they are performing under new boss Marco Silva since he took over in October. Tigers fans remain positive that they can avoid the drop to the Championship."

19',action,"Andy Robertson and Grosicki are linking up well down the left, causing Danny Simpson plenty of problems. Mahrez is doing well as well down that flank but is struggling to get back and help his right-back out which is leaving Simpson open."

17',action,Leicester try to retaliate straight away but nothing comes of their attack. Hull are getting players back in numbers and so far frustrating their opponents. That Hull goal has certainly silenced the home supporters.

14',goal,"Goal Sam Clucas ; GOOOAAALLL! HULL TAKE THE LEAD! Sam Clucas has put the Tigers one-nil here at the King Power Stadium with a simple tap-in after an excellent piece of play by Kamil Grosicki. Grosicki breaks forward quickly leading a Hull counter-attack, he gets to the byline and pulls the ball back for Clucas, who turns the ball home from close range."

14',action,STAT: Leicester are unbeaten in four home games against Hull since March 2008. Plus there have been six red cards in the last eight league meetings - three for each side.

12',action,"Very even game at the moment, both teams are looking full of confidence despite their league positions. Leicester look the more dangerous side going forward at the moment with those two chances early on still the best of the game."

10',action,"Robert Huth rises highest and clears the ball out for a corner, which comes to nothing. Both sides look threatening here so far, an early goal for either side would be massive."

9',action,"Free-kick to Hull in a decent position. On the right wing, around 10 yards from the edge of the box with Kamil Grosicki to whip it in to the box..."

8',action,"That good period of play for the Foxes has certainly given the home supporters a good lift and they are doing their best to create a good atmosphere inside the King Power Stadium, in what is a huge game for them."

6',action,"HE SHOULD'VE SCORED! Marc Albrighton some how manages to miss from a yard out, it was excellent defending from Harry Maguire to put the winger under pressure and force him to put his effort wide. Vardy broke free down the left and played a ball between the goalkeeper and defenders, straight to Albrighton. Two very good chances for Leicester early on!"

4',action,"CHANCE! Wes Morgan with a fantastic opportunity to open the scoring! Riyad Mahrez whipped in a free-kick which was won by Jamie Vardy. The Foxes skipper was completly unmarked in the box and had a free header, but he put it wide!"

3',action,"This is a good start by Hull, they are keeping possession of the ball well and look comfortable playing the ball around. So far no chances by either team though."

2',action,This is a huge game for both teams as they fight to avoid relegation from the Premier League. There are a few teams in contention to go down and three points for Hull or Leicester today could be massive come May.
