,action,"Full-time at the Vicente Calderon. It was certainly not a vintage performance from Atletico Madrid, but they run out narrow 1-0 winners after an early goal from Nico Gaitan in the first half. Not a game for the football purist, but Diego Simeone won't care as his side get the three points today. Thanks for joining us!"
90'+3',substitution,Substitution sub-out Antoine Griezmann sub-in José María Giménez de Vargas . Griezmann comes off for Gimenez just as we approach the final whistle.
90'+1',action,"Three minutes of added time have been allocaed by the referee so a little more time than Atletico were perhaps expecting considering there was none in the first half. Betis aren't showing much though so it looks like this is going to be another classic Simeone-inspired, scrappy win with a clean sheet."
89',yellow-card,Yellow Card Daniel Ceballos Fernández. A booking for Ceballos now and this one IS certainly deserved as the Betis man hauls and pulls at the shirt of Koke a few yards in from the right touchline. A cheap yellow to get at this stage.
86',action,Carrasco and Filipe attempt to link-up down the left wing but a poor touch from the Belgian sees the attack come to nothing. The hosts eventually win the ball back after some retreating work from the substitute but possession is back in a deeper position with Gabi now rather than deep down the channel.
84',action,"Koke is another player who has been under par for Atletico today but he attempts to make up for his inept performance now with an exciting venture down the right. He has two opportunities to get a cross into the box, but Adan is equal to both with the second clearance going out for another corner-kick."
82',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Alexander Alegría Moreno sub-in Roman Zozulya . Another alteration from the visitors as Sanchez looks to freshen up his frontline. Coming on is former Dynamo Kyiv striker, sub-in Roman Zozulya, and he will replace Alegria up top, with the latter being booked just a couple of minutes ago so perhaps this was a factor in the change."
80',action,"The match is still very scrappy and cagey at the minute which will serve Atletico Madrid just fine as they only have 10 minutes to hold on for the win so any stoppages in play will halt any ascendancy for Betis. The visitors really should be throwing everything at Atleti here, but they just can't seem to muster up a threat."
78',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Alexander Alegría Moreno. Alegria, who has certainly not been shy in putting his body about tonight, eventually goes into the book after a late tackle of Godin. That one had been coming for a while."
76',action,"Carrasco, who has been fairly quiet since his introduction, takes on Piccini with a cracking bit of pace down the left wing and just manages to gain a yard on the full-back to get the cross in at the byline. However, Atletico are forced to settle for their sixth corner of the match after the interception from the defender at the front post. It looked like Donk."
74',action,"It will be interesting to see how Atletico approach the last period of the match as they really cannot afford to drop points before Villarreal, in fifth position, take on Deportivo later on. Will they sit back or will they go for that elusive second goal?"
72',action,"The substitutions from Simeone have just sparked a little more life in his players now as they realise that the current scoreline is far too close for comfort. Betis really have nothing to lose now, especially considering their place in the table, so perhaps some more space will generate for Atletico going forward."
70',substitution,Substitution sub-out José Carlos Ramírez Suárez sub-in Matías Nahuel Leiva Esquivel . Betis also make an alteration as Nahuel Leiva enters the action to replace Jose Carlos.
70',substitution,Substitution sub-out Fernando José Torres Sanz sub-in Kevin Gameiro . Torres comes off and is replaced by sub-in Kevin Gameiro for Atletico.
69',yellow-card,Yellow Card Šime Vrsaljko. Yellow card Šime Vrsaljko
68',action,"Just about a quarter of the match remaining now and Atletico Madrid still continue to narrowly hold on to this lead despite being very far away from their best. Griezmann in particular has been an attacking non-entity up top, and even though he hasn't had much service he has barely affected the play in the final third."
66',action,"Joaquin looks to make an instant impact off the bench as he pops up on the left wing to pass square into the feet of Ruben Castro. The 34-year-old goes for goal from distance with a superb strike which looks all the way to be dipping under the crossbar, but Moya comes to the rescue for Atletico as he tips over the bar."
64',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Darko Brašanac sub-in Joaquín Sánchez Rodríguez . Victor Sanchez, in turn, makes his opening change for Betis as Brasanac comes off for Joaquin. The veteran winger still has some explosive dribbling ability on those wings, so the visitors will be hoping to see some of it as we approach the latter stages."
62',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Osvaldo Nicolás Fabián Gaitán sub-in Yannick Ferreira Carrasco . The first booking is swiftly followed by the opening substitution of play, and with the way Atletico are playing it was only a matter of time before Simeone changed things. Leaving the pitch is the solitary goalscorer, Gaitan, and he will be replaced by talented Belgian winger, Yannick Carrasco."
60',yellow-card,Yellow Card Cristiano Piccini. First yellow card of the match now and it is slightly harsh on Piccini as he just goes in late on Filipe after allowing the ball to run away from him a little bit. The Betis full-back will need to watch himself for the last 30 minutes.
58',action,"With Atletico toiling a little, the Vicente Calderon faithful begin to let their voices be heard with some singing to try and inspire some creativity. Inspiration is certainly needed from somewhere, but Simeone can take heart from the fact that his side do have that narrow advantage which makes things not as nervy as they could potentially have been."
56',action,"Godin receives the ball to feet at the back and goes on a penetrating run through the middle before being dispossesed in a really dangerous area by Ceballos. Luckily for the Uruguayan, a couple of his team-mates bail him out and eventually win the ball back for the home side before Betis can pose a threat."
54',action,"We get our first glimpse of Torres as an attacking threat in the second period, or even in the match as a whole as he breaks beyond the Betis backline to make his way to the byline. However, with the angle pretty tight, Adan manages to proactively come off his line to claim the cross out of the air from the Atleti striker."
52',action,"Betis will be wondering just how they haven't managed to get back on level terms here. They haven't created a plethora of chances, but in terms of command of the ball they have definitely been on a level-footing with Simeone's Champions League finalists from last season."
50',action,"Piccini, who actually got on the scoresheet in the win against Eibar in the last Liga match, displays an impressive turn of pace to dart to the byline again before standing a wicked cross to the back post. Alegria meets it with an ambitious, attempted bicycle kick, but Atletico manage to clear after a couple of scares."
48',action,"Ceballos continues to cause plenty of problems in the final third and does well to earn a free-kick around 30 yards out. After some deliberation, Ruben Castro is the man tasked with the set-piece, but the strike is disappointingly sent harmlessly into the arms of Moya, who was positioned perfectly."
46',action,We are back under way in the Vicente Calderon!
,action,"Half-time in Madrid as the referee does not add any time on. Atletico Madrid are on course for another three points in the Spanish Primera Division thanks to a Nico Gaitan goal to go into the break at 1-0, but with Betis encouraging in their response this game is far from over. Second period to come."
44',action,There probably won't be too much injury time here at the Vicente Calderon as even with the scrappy passes and the solitary goal there haven't been a great deal of stoppages.
42',action,"BEST CHANCE OF THE MATCH FOR BETIS! Piccini kicks the visitors into gear with a marauding run deep down the right flank before eventually cutting his way into the box past two or three challenges. As the cross comes in it takes a few deflections with Jonas collecting to feet, but the strike on goal whilst under pressure from the defender is pounced upon by Moya. That probably should be 1-1!"
40',action,"Much, much better from the Colchoneros this time as they are more patient in their build up down the left flank. Koke awaits for Filipe to make the run in behind and eventually threads a lovely pass through into space, but the hosts are forced to settle for the corner-kick after the clearance from Carlos."
38',action,"As he tends to do whenever Atletico aren't creating anything, Griezmann is coming incredibly deep into midfield to try and see a bit more of the ball. He has been bereft of any kind of service so far so is taking it upon himself to try and affect proceedings from areas further back."
36',action,There hasn't really been a noticeable pattern of play to this game in the first half as neither side has sustained dominance in terms of possession or chances created. Atletico really are gifting Betis the opportunity to get back into this with their failure to maintain a threat in the final third for a decent period. SO many scrappy passes from both teams.
34',action,"SAAAAAVE FROM MOYA! A horrendous pass out of the back from Savic is pounced upon by the Betis frontline who look to take advantage of the error. Ruben Castro is the man with the ball at his feet and eventually tries his luck with a lashed attempt at goal from 18 yards, but it proves to be fairly routine for Moya in the end. What was Savic doing there, though?"
32',action,Torres has been poor in the opening half-hour and just can't seem to get the ball to stick to his feet up top whenever he receives a pass. He only doesn't concede possession this time because Donk is penalised for a foul even after clearly getting the ball in a tackle with the former Chelsea and Liverpool striker.
30',action,A good period of sustained possession from the Beticos here as they look to claw back an equaliser. Durmisi and Ceballos look their best bet to try and break down the Atletico defence at the moment as the duo continute to link-up impressively down this left-hand side.
28',action,"Saul has been deployed on the right wing by Simeone here but has clearly been given license to move in from the touchline to try and create. On this occasion, however, he stays within his realm to power ahead to hit the byline and smash a low cross along the six-yard box, only for Adan to make the brave interception."
26',action,"Jonas Martin has been impressive for Betis so far in the first and continues to pop up all over the place looking for possession. This time he ventures into space on the left before cutting inside on his right foot to curl a cross to the back post for Ruben Castro, but the subsequent header from the striker goes straight into the arms of the grateful Moya."
24',action,"Durmisi has displayed plenty of attacking ambition in the past few minutes and is certainly giving Vrsaljko something to think about at right-back. On this occasion, the Betis man drives down the left channel on the overlap before whipping a teasing cross ominously into the box, but Savic is positioned well to clear behind for the corner at the front post."
22',action,"We are just approaching the midway point of the first half now and Atletico Madrid find themselves ahead after that Gaitan goal. However, Simeone's men have been guilty of not taking advantage of their stellar beginning to play as Betis are growing in confidence with each passing minute. Adan really hasn't had anything to do between the sticks apart from pick the ball out of his net!"
20',action,We haven't seen too much from Griezmann and Torres up top for Atletico as of yet as most of their play has been channelled down the wings into space. The midfield is not doing a particularly great job in providing service to the striking duo so far.
18',action,"Alegria is fouled down the right flank and Betis get the free-kick before sending all the tall players up for the set-piece. However, the defenders are forced to trudge back into their own half with anger as Piccini conspires with Ceballos to waste the opportunity with a quick pass that filters out into a goal-kick to Atletico. Really poor decision-making."
16',action,"The ball is speculatively thrown up the right-hand side from the Betis defence and Alegria takes in, but not before allowing the ball to bounce up off the top of his arm to concede the free-kick. Any time the visitors look to be gaining the ascendancy, something scrappy happens to take down the tempo."
14',action,"Savic gets into a sticky situation at the back for Atletico and ends up facing his own goal with the ball at his feet near the corner flag. However, he is let off the hook massively by Ruben Castro who stupidly comes in to concede the foul with a shove to the back on the defender. Needless."
12',action,"Betis are really struggling to maintain any kind of passing game here and are resorting to booting the ball high up the park just to take the pressure off at the back. This is playing into the hands of Atletico a bit, though, as Godin and Savic are pressing right up to the halfway line to squeeze the space in the opposition half."
10',action,"Well, on paper this didn't look like a particularly easy game for Atletico as Betis have proved their solidity at times this season. However, they have made the perfect start and now have the platform to go on and score a few more to claim the vital three points. Still very early, though."
8',goal,Goal Osvaldo Nicolás Fabián Gaitán. GOOOAAAAALLLLL FOR ATLETICO MADRID! The hosts take the lead after just eight minutes! A sweeping attack down the right eventually sees Vrsaljko meet the ball on the flank before smashing a cross into the box which is deflected to the back post. Gaitan gets ahead of his marker to stab home! One-nil.
7',action,"Saul has been pretty prominent on the right channel in the first few minutes of play and this time manages to get in behind the Betis defence into the box. He latches on to a loose, bouncing ball and lashes a cross-cum-shot along the area, but in the end it flashes wide of the left-hand post."
5',action,"Alegria is making a nuisance of himself in these opening stages and makes the hearts of the Atletico fans miss a beat as he goes down inside the penalty area under the challenge of Godin. However, there wasn't much contact from the Uruguayan so no penalty is given to Betis on this occasion."
3',action,"A decent start to proceedings from Atletico who are looking to dominate possession early on. They need to start putting together a run of victories if they are to finally mount a title challenge, and they only very narrowly went through in the Spanish Cup during the week against Las Palmas so there is plenty of work to be done by Simeone and his charges."

,action,TEAM NEWS...
,action,"The last clash between Atletico Madrid and Real Betis took place last season, once again at the Vicente Calderon in the Spanish top-flight. On that occasion in April of last year, Simeone's charges recorded an emphatic 5-1 home win against the Beticos, with Griezmann grabbing the headlines with a couple of goals."
,action,"The two sides featuring tonight both enjoyed similar fortunes in their previous Liga fixtures. Atletico earned three points away at Eibar with a 2-0 win, with Saul Niguez and Antoine Griezmann getting on the scoresheet, while Betis won with the same result at home to Leganes. Ruben Castro and Cristiano Piccini got the goals in that victory."
,action,"Betis, meanwhile, are having a relatively underwhelming campaign and are currently situated in 14th. The Andalusians are nine points clear of the relegation zone and can go into the top half of the table with a win today, but will be looking towards a much more positive second half of the season from the start of 2017."
,action,"Under the tutelage of Diego Simeone, the Colchoneros have pretty much always been involved in the title race up against the Clasico duo of Barcelona and Real Madrid. However, they are currently nine points adrift of their city rivals at the top of the table, with Zinedine Zidane's men also having the advantage of a game in hand. Indeed, Atleti will probably be looking over their shoulders to Villarreal in fifth rather than towards any championship assault."
