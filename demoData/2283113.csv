,action,"FULL-TIME! Barcelona close out a comfortable 3-0 victory over Athletic Bilbao at Camp Nou, with Alcacer, Messi and Aleix Vidal grabbing the goals. Enrique's men maintain their great home form, with Los Leones ending up toothless. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+2',action,"Neymar tries to shoot from the left-hand side, but a deflected effort from the Brazilian is half-dealt with by Iraizoz. The experienced goalkeeper punches the ball behind for a corner, which is taken short, as Barcelona retain possession for the dying stages."
90'+1',action,There are three minutes of second-half stoppage time at Camp Nou.
89',action,"Rakitic shoots over! Vidal sees a close-range shot blocked, before the Croatia international follows up and snatches at the rebound. He blazes a long way over the crossbar. Disappointing effort from the substitute."
88',action,"Neymar is released into the clear, and beats De Marcos with ease. The Brazilian winger drops a shoulder and delivers a low cross, but Laporte slides in to make a block. Moments later, Vidal shoots wide of the top corner with a speculative effort."
86',action,"Muniain drives forward and opens play out to the right-hand side, with De Marcos invited towards the byline. With a few players at the back post, the Athletic Bilbao right-back sends a terrible cross almost out of play. He has been dreadful this afternoon."
84',action,"Barcelona are slowing things down with some patient posssession, as Enrique's men are more than happy to ease their way to the full-time whistle. The intensity has really dropped out of this contest in the last 15 minutes or so."
82',action,"Neymar and Alcacer try to play a nice one-two in the middle of the park, but it doesn't quite come off, leading to an Athletic Bilbao break. Balenziaga tries to whip in a cross for the away side, but Ter Stegen is able to make a very simple claim."
80',action,"Wide from Eraso! The substitute is fed into the penalty area by Aduriz, but the Athletic Bilbao midfielder can only run onto the ball and drag a shot a long way beyond the far post. That was a nice move from Los Leones."
79',action,"Williams tries to cause some problems down the right-hand side, but a cross-cum-shot from the Spaniard is thundered into the side netting at Ter Stegen's near post. That has been Athletic Bilbao's problem all day, their cutting edge just hasn't been there."
77',action,"Mathieu is released down the left-hand side by Neymar, before curling an inviting cross into the box. Alcacer stretches and tries to direct a close-range finish home, but Laporte slides in to make a good block. Barcelona are still having all of the good chances."
75',action,"Neymar drives down the left and gets into the penalty area, but Laporte covers across to slide in and make a great challenge. The French defender gives away a corner as a result, but the set-piece is curled onto the roof of the net. Wasteful."
74',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Raúl García Escudero sub-in Javier Eraso Goñi . Raul Garcia jogs off, with Javier Eraso freshening things up in the midfield third."
72',action,"Neymar shoots from outside the box, but Iraizoz does well enough to get low down to his left and smother the Brazilian's drive. Momentarily, he spills the ball, but pounces on it quickly. Barcelona threaten down the right in their next attack, but Yeray clears a cut-back."
70',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Aymeric Laporte. Raul Garcia flicks the ball up and looks to shoot from close-range, but Ter Stegen clears, with Laporte then penalised for tugging Alcacer back. He gets a yellow card for being cynical."
69',action,"Williams gets into the clear, finding space in Barcelona's box, but play is pulled back immediately for the Spaniard straying offside. Things just aren't going Athletic Bilbao's way at all. Ter Stegen hasn't had much to do at all since the restart."
67',goal,"Goal Aleix Vidal Parreu. GOOOOOOOAL! VIDAL MAKES IT 3-0! All smiles on the bench once again, as the right-back immediately makes an impact after being pushed on. He drifts infield and gets the ball onto his left foot, before steering a great finish into the bottom-right corner."
66',action,"Barcelona are happy to retain possession and play their way out from the back patiently. Enrique's men are in no rush, they are in a great position heading into the business end of this game. Benat plays a pass out to the right, but De Marcos' cross sails straight behind for a goal-kick."
64',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini sub-in Sergi Roberto Carnicer . Messi is withdrawn by Enrique for the late stages of this game, with Sergi Roberto coming into the game. That should see Aleix Vidal pushed up a little."
63',action,"Aduriz tries to open play out to the left-hand side, but instead gifts possession away to Rakitic in the middle of midfield. He shakes his head - he has been quite poor since taking to the field. Less than half an hour remains for Athletic Bilbao to turn this one around, and they aren't going to get anywhere with passing like that."
61',action,"Williams breaks down the right flank and tries to cut inside Umtiti, before a cross from the Spaniard is cleared by Mascherano. Athletic Bilbao maintain their pressure, with a delivery floated in from the left moments later, but Williams is caught offside at the back post. Valverde is fuming with his own player."
59',substitution,Substitution sub-out Mikel San José Domínguez sub-in Beñat Etxebarria Urkiaga . San Jose is replaced by Benat in the middle of midfield for Athletic Bilbao.
59',action,"Into the side netting! Messi drives down the left and shoots from a tight angle, but he can only rattle a shot wide of the near upright. Barcelona keep creating the good opportunities, with Iraizoz being worried regularly."
58',action,"Wide from Neymar! The Brazil international tries to shoot from deep inside the Athletic Bilbao box, after combining with Messi once again. He wriggles to find some space, while shifting the ball onto his left foot, but the Barcelona winger can only shoot both high and wide of the target."
56',action,"Williams drives down the right-hand side and tries to shoot from a tight angle, but the young forward blasts an awful effort a long way over the crossbar. Valverde's men haven't been able to create any clear-cut opportunities in this second half."
54',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Rafael Alcântara do Nascimento sub-in Ivan Rakitić . Rakitic comes into the game, with Rafinha replaced due to needing extended treatment on his face on the touchline."
53',action,"Raul Garcia is the target of a quick ball into the penalty area, but the Spaniard can only drag a tame shot within the grasp of Ter Stegen. The Athletic Bilbao forward has been rather wasteful throughout this game."
52',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Íñigo Lekue Martínez sub-in Aritz Aduriz Zubeldia . Aduriz comes into the game for the away side, with Lekue the man replaced. Valverde wants to push on and grab a goal."
52',action,"Williams and De Marcos combine down the right, but a cross from the latter is stroked clear by Mascherano. Athletic Bilbao maintain their pressure, and Lekue wins a corner for the visitors. Ter Stegen comes out brilliantly to punch clear, but he catches Rafinha in the face with his knee. Raul Garcia pushed him into it. That looks nasty."
50',action,"Yeray covers across to deny Mathieu and give Barcelona another corner, but it is taken short. Rafinha is picked out by a clipped cross to the back post, but the Brazilian midfielder can only nod Arda's delivery into the side netting. Yeray did just enough to put him off."
48',action,"Neymar whips in a corner delivery from the left-hand side, but Andre Gomes is penalised for tugging on Raul Garcia's shirt. The Brazilian has already been causing a few issues down the same flank in the opening stages of this half. He is looking in the mood."
46',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Gerard Piqué Bernabéu sub-in Javier Alejandro Mascherano . Mascherano replaces Pique at centre-back for the second half, after getting away with receiving a second booking right on the verge of half-time."
46',action,We are back underway in the second half! Barcelona have a two-goal advantage and will want to make it three to close this game out as quickly as possible. Athletic Bilbao have it all to do if they are to cause an upset.
,action,"HALF-TIME! Barcelona go into the dressing room with a 2-0 lead over Athletic Bilbao, courtesy of goals from Alcacer and Messi. Iraizoz has been the villain for the away side, who have been competitive but thus far unable to make the most of their chances. Valverde will need to rethink things to turn this contest around."
45',action,"Athletic Bilbao enjoy a lengthy spell of possession, with Barcelona happy to have a rest and sit back for the remaining few minutes of the half. Pique goes through Laporte on the edge of the penalty area, but the referee doesn't give a foul. That was an awful challenge."
43',action,"De Marcos is found overlapping down the right-hand side, but a clipped cross from the full-back is nodded away by Pique. Raul Garcia just hasn't been able to compete in the air. Neymar is released down the left and leaves San Jose in a heap, but the Brazilian can only go on to slot a finish just the wrong side of the far upright."
41',action,"Athletic Bilbao will have a mountain to climb in the second half, as Iraizoz continues to be repeatedly flummoxed by Messi free-kicks. Enrique will be overjoyed, as that cheap goal has put his side in a fantastic position."
40',goal,"Goal Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini. GOOOOOOOOOAL! Messi has the chance to curl in a free-kick from high on the right flank, which is essentially a corner for the hosts. The Argentine shoots with his left foot, and somehow Iraizoz doesn't make a save at his near post! The experienced goalkeeper will want the ground to swallow him up there."
37',action,"The away side will be looking to try and claw a goal back in the next five minutes or so, as the interval approaches. Balenziaga tries to shoot from essentially the half-way line, after spotting Ter Stegen off his line, but the left-back's effort sails just shy of the far post. Audacious effort, and for a minute the Germany international would have been concerned."
35',action,"Athletic Bilbao are getting a little frustrated now, with plenty of free-kicks being given in favour of Barcelona. Neymar is being obstructed all over the field, and the referee is keeping a watchful eye on it. Messi tries to sidestep his way into the penalty box, but the Argentina international is quickly tackled in a congested area."
34',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Óscar de Marcos Arana. The referee has been busy early on, with De Marcos the latest man to go into the book for a cynical tackle. Neymar has been causing the right-back all manner of problems."
32',action,"Williams gets into the penalty area on the left-hand side, and jinks inside, before shooting with his right foot. Ter Stegen stands tall at the near post and makes a very good stop to deny the young Athletic Bilbao forward. The German goalkeeper has been impressive so far."
31',action,"The away side continue to threaten on the break, with Barcelona gifting possession away in some dangerous areas. Aduriz might be wondering if he'd have found the back of the net by now, had he been given a start."
29',action,"Neymar bends in a cross from the left-hand side, but Iraizoz makes a simple catch within his six-yard box. Barcelona continue to play the ball around at the back, and Umtiti gives possession away to Raul Garcia! The Spanish midfielder drills a low shot goalwards, but Ter Stegen makes an easy save."
27',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ander Iturraspe Derteano. Iturraspe picks up the second booking of the afternoon, and will have to watch his step now."
27',action,"Muniain tries to angle in a cross from the right byline, but Barcelona clear, with the hosts' back four continuing to defend their 18-yard box well. The home side burst up the other end, with Neymar forcing Laporte into a foul on the left-hand side. The Brazilian's pace is a thorn in De Marcos' side."
25',action,"Williams tees up San Jose on the edge of the penalty area, but the Spain international is unable to hit the target! He drives into the box and shoots, under heavy pressure from Mathieu, but blasts the ball into orbit. It might have taken a little deflection off a defender's boot, but the referee isn't interested - much to the disbelief of the Athletic Bilbao midfielder."
23',action,"Over the top from Iturraspe! The Athletic Bilbao midfielder tried to curl a delicate free-kick finish into the top-left corner, but Ter Stegen is happy to watch the ball sail into the stands. Valverde's men need to try and keep getting regular service up to Raul Garcia, as he is causing a few issues for Barcelona."
22',yellow-card,Yellow Card Gerard Piqué Bernabéu. Pique gets a yellow card for hauling down Raul Garcia as the experienced midfielder looked to get into the box. The Barcelona centre-back was caught in possession and had no option but to foul his man.
20',action,"Williams is the target of a long ball over the top, but the Athletic Bilbao forward loses the flight of the ball and it comically bounces off his back and away to safety. The home fans are in fine voice, that goal from Alcacer has Camp Nou feeling like a footballing festival. Neymar and Messi are causing all kinds of problems."
18',assist,Assist Neymar da Silva Santos Junior. Neymar uses his explosive pace to get the chance to supply a much-needed assist for Alcacer.
18',goal,"Goal Francisco Alcácer García. GOOOOOOOOAL! ALCACER SCORES HIS FIRST LEAGUE GOAL FOR BARCELONA! Gomes opens play out to the left-hand side well, with Neymar able to drive to the left byline. The Brazil international cuts back a neat pass, and the ex-Valencia striker steers home a first-time finish. Beautiful instinctive touch."
17',action,"Williams finds Lekue driving down the right-hand side, but the Spaniard is penalised for tugging at Mathieu's shirt in a bid to wriggle his way into the box. The home side counter, with Neymar able to cut a cross back to Messi, but the Argentine star sees a first-time shot blocked well. Iraizoz still hasn't been tested between Los Leones' posts."
15',action,"Balenziaga drifts a cross in from the left, but Pique clears, with Athletic Bilbao maintaining their pressure. Williams is fed to the right byline and cuts back a neat cross, but Umtiti intercepts at the near post. Raul Garcia should have been more alive to that. Barcelona counter, with Neymar and Messi combining on the edge of the penalty area, but yet again they try to play too intricately and De Marcos clears."
13',action,"The away side win a free-kick high on the left-hand side, but Iturraspe's delivery is headed to safety by Umtiti. Valverde will be pleased with how his side have traded blows in these opening stages in Catalonia. Muniain scampers down the left, but Rafinha gets back well to deny a crossing opportunity."
12',action,"Wide from Williams! The young forward is picked out by a fantastic cross from Laporte, with the delivery dipping nicely over the figure of Umtiti. The Athletic Bilbao striker tries to flick a header back across goal, but instead he completely fails to hit the target. Disappointing, as that was a great chance."
11',action,"Lekue is the target of a good switch of play out to the right, but Neymar tracks back nicely to win the ball back and earn the applause of the home fans. Barcelona are dropping extremely deep in an attempt to play their way through Athletic Bilbao's press. Mathieu is found overlapping down the left once again, but a cut-back from the Frenchman is directed horribly away from Neymar."
9',action,"Valverde is ensuring that Barcelona have to play rushed, direct passes up to Alcacer, with the Spanish striker struggling to offer much in the way of a focal point. Messi drills a pass into Neymar, with the Brazilian then trying to flick a cute little ball over the top for his striker to chase, but Yeray lashes the danger clear."
7',action,"The hosts are anjoying the lion's share of possession, with Ter Stegen spending plenty of time with the ball at his feet. Williams is released down the right for Athletic Bilbao and whips in a cross, but Andre Gomes covers across to make a good interception at his near post. This is a very open and even contest so far."
5',action,"Athletic Bilbao are pressing high as usual, with Valverde's line-up ensuring that Williams and Raul Garcia are making life difficult for Barcelona when the hosts try to build from the back. Enrique's men are trying to be positive, playing incisive passes down the flanks, but Iraizoz is yet to be tested. Mathieu tries to overlap down the left, but De Marcos outmuscles him well."
3',action,"Alcacer is released in behind down the right-hand side, before cutting back a ball from the flank. Neymar shifts the ball onto his stronger left foot, before dragging a shot a long way wide of the far post.
