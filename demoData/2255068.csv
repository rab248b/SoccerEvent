,action,"And that will do it from the Allianz Arena as Schalke celebrate an unlikely, but fully deserved point. Lewandowski's early opener was cancelled out by Naldo 13 minutes in, and a spirited showing by the visitors in both halves saw them more than equal a disappointing effort from the hosts. That's all from us, thanks for tuning in!"
90'+3',action,"ALMOST A LATE WINNER! A cross comes in that's flicked to the back post by Lewandowski. Coman hesitated at the back post, and that allowed Fahrmann and Nastasic to combine and clear!"
90'+1',action,"Frustration all around as it appears that Bayern will not have enough time to get the goal to give them all three points. Schalke have been tuned in from minute one, and they deserve this incoming point."
89',action,"WONDERFUL CHALLENGE! Schalke hit the pause button long enough for Muller to burst into the box onto Alonso's pass, but Nastasic races across his box to make an outstanding tackle!"
87',substitution,Substitution sub-out Leon Goretzka sub-in Thilo Kehrer . Goretzka has been withdrawn for Kehrer.
87',action,"JUST WIDE! Alaba has been influential since his introduction, sending in another fantastic ball to the wide-open Martinez at the far post. He touches it down, but can't find the target!"
85',action,"OVER THE CROSSBAR! Good play again from Bayern as Alaba sends in a cross for Lewandowski that's cleared only to Alonso at the edge of the D. He strikes it first time, but it's well over."
83',action,"INCHES AWAY! That's the best we've seen from Bayern in the second half. Costa sends in a peach of a delivery that fizzes across the six-yard area. Everyone - Fahrmann, Howedes and crucially, Lewandowski - misses it. If he gambled to ger on the end of that, he would have scored."
81',action,"The excellent Kolasinac buys yet another free-kick as Costa bundles him over. He's been everywhere, up and down that lef flank and Bayern have had no answer for him off the ball."
79',action,"So Bayern have changed both of their full-backs here, but there still may be a switch in formation despite the like-for-like swaps, with a back three looking like the way that they'll play the final 10 minutes or so."
77',substitution,Substitution sub-out Juan Bernat Velasco sub-in David Olatukunbo Alaba . David Alaba is also introduced as Bernat heads off.
77',substitution,Substitution sub-out Márcio Rafael Ferreira de Souza sub-in Philipp Lahm . Big moment for sub-in Philipp Lahm as he makes his 500th Bayern appearance in place of Rafinha.
76',yellow-card,Yellow Card Javier Martínez Aginaga. Martinez is shown a yellow card.
75',action,Fifteen minutes to go now and still no goals in this game for over an hour now. Do any of these sides have it in them to make a push for the winner? Schalke seem happy to defend at the moment.
73',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Guido Burgstaller sub-in Jean-Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting . Burgstaller's game is at an end as Choupo-Moting, still probably not 100 per cent fit, will play the final quarter of an hour or so."
72',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Arjen Robben sub-in Kingsley Coman . Robben trudges off, looking very frustrated in a game where he failed to build on a strong start. On comes sub-in Kingsley Coman to replace him."
71',action,"Another piece of accomplished play at the back, this tome down at the other end of the pitch. Naldo goes through the ball with a powerful challenge that takes Lewandowski out of the equation. The striker is muttering something under his breath, but it was fair play."
69',action,"Good period this from Schalke, as Caligiuri and Schopf combine to open up space on the right flank, but Bernat is out to doe enough to put the pair off a cross. Good defending."
67',action,"Kolasinac this time decides to hold the ball up instead of releasing an early pass, and he coerces Robben into dragging him down, winning a defensive free-kick that relieves some pressure."
65',action,"A dangerous free-kick is cleared by Howedes, and Schalke can launch a counter-attack. However, Kolasinac fails to execute with his pass out of defence, as neither Bentaleb nor Burgstaller were picked out."
63',action,Signs that Schalke may just be starting to lose some energy a Bentaleb yells at Kolasinac to get back in position and defend the flank. They haven't broken for the opposite end in a while.
61',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Nabil Bentaleb. That was a dangerous challenge from Bentaleb, and he'll be booked for it. He flattened Rafinha in plain view of the Bayern Munich bench, and there was an audible outcry."
59',substitution,Substitution sub-out Holger Badstuber sub-in Matija Nastasić . Surprising change here as Badstuber is withdrawn. His outing against his parent club lasts the best part of an hour. He's put in an accomplished display so unless there's a fitness concern I'm not sure what that's about. Matija Nastasic is on in his place.
57',action,"A corner from Costa is acrobatically heeled by Lewandowki towards the heart of the six-yard area. Muller challenges Fahrmann for the ball, and is whistled for being too aggressive against the goalkeeper."
55',action,"Schalke have looked the more dangerous side in this game, and Ancelotti should be very concerned as the result is in serious danger if the visitors continue to attack in this manner."
53',action,"GOAL RULED OUT! Bayern are lucky as the narrowest of offside calls cancels out a goal from Caligiuri. On the counter, Bentaleb has a half-volley that touches off the wide man and into the back of the net."
50',action,"Badstuber goes to ground and Ancelotti isn't happy with the decision, but it was the correct one. That ends a dangerous spell of possession and pressure from the home side."
48',action,"Schalke show Bayern again that they have the danger to break whenever the home side suck too many men forward. However, it's Fahrmann who's called into action first to deal with a good cross by Costa."
46',action,We're back!
,action,"It's been a tremendous first half here at the Allianz Arena. An early goal from Lewandowski could have spelled disaster for Schalke, but they drew level via Naldo's free-kick and have gone from strength to strength since. Both teams have created chances, but will Weinzierl's outfit regret some of these missed opportunities at the end of the game?"
45',action,"OFF THE FRAME OF THE GOAL! Bayern's turn to rattle the woodwork as Robben lifts the ball towards Lewandowski, who brings it down, shifts onto his right foot and bends a superb effort onto the top corner of the post."
43',action,"HE SHOULD HAVE PULLED THE TRIGGER! Goretzka makes a great move through the centre that catches Bayern out, but when faced one-on-one with Neuer, he takes too long to make up his mind and Bernat can nip in to put him off a shot."
41',action,"OFF THE WOODWORK! Another incisive move from the visitors! Kolasinac breaks forward to latch onto a leading pass from Nabil Bentaleb, but it's put onto the crossbar by Burgstaller!"
39',action,"Good defending from Badstuber to deny his former team-mate Lewandowski, but it comes at the expense of a corner kick. Schalke clear the danger as far as Costa, but his 25-yarder doesn't trouble anyone."
37',action,"Benedikt Howedes races for the ball, but he's stopped in his tracks by a strong challenge from Vidal on the slide. The Chilean clearly won the ball even though he went in hard, but the referee still gives a foul."
35',action,"Goretzka, who has been very influential so far in this game, gets another chance to drive forward. He spots the run of the overlapping Kolasinac, and feeds the full-back, whose low cross is hacked away by Hummels."
32',action,"Schalke fashion another scoring chance in the Bayern penalty area as Goretzka brings down a long ball on the left side, but elects to hammer a shot over the bar instead of setting up the open Burgstaller inside the area."
30',action,"Fahrmann does well to get rid of the danger at his near post with Muller closing him down by the second. Bayern come back at Schalke, but a double deflection sees Bernat play the ball off Costa and hand possession back to the visitors."
28',action,A wonderful tempo to this game and a lot of that is down to Schalke refusing to roll over and allow Bayern to do what they want. The home side look a little rattled as they also feel a few decisions have gone against them.
25',action,"GREAT MOVE! Bayern switch play from right to left, and Juan Bernat takes a glorious first touch to evade his man and open up space for a shot on Fahrmann. However, his low attempt is stopped by the keeper's leg."
23',action,"Rafinha goes forward and nearly scampers beyond Holger Badstuber, and the defender's lack of pace shows as he clips the Brazilian full-back. The referee is over straight away, but only for a lecture."
21',action,"Excellent response from Schalke to going behind, although they were concerned for a moment after an ambitious corner from Costa goes to the edge of the area for Robben to strike full on the volley. Not quite his goal against Manchester United in 2010 though, as it flies over."
19',action,"ANOTHER GREAT BREAK! Schalke put Bayern on the back foot again as Burgstaller draws two markers before working the ball to the open Sead Kolasinac, who blasts it right at Neuer! The keeper palms it over though."
17',action,"When you look back at that Schalke goal, it's clear that Neuer should take some blame. Even though it looked like a deflection fooled him, it was actually a clean strike from Naldo that beat him."
15',action,"Alessandro Schopf gets scaled by Vidal when battling for a cross, and the Chilean won the header easily. No foul, but he's unable to direct it on target to really trouble Ralf Fahrmann in goal."
13',assist,Assist Daniel Caligiuri. Caligiuri had the last touch in the set-piece routine before Naldo struck.
13',goal,"Goal Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues. NALDO FIZZES IT HOME! Schalke waste no time restoring parity. The free-kick was touched short for Naldo to hammer, and his effort beats Manuel Neuer at his near post!"
13',action,"Burgstaller does well to charge forward and buy a free-kick off Vidal, who was a fraction late. This is a good position for Schalke to cause some problems from the set-piece, and Naldo is eyeing this."
12',action,ANOTHER OPENING! Uncharacteristically poor execution from Thomas Muller at the top of the box sees him miss a pass to the wide open Costa on the left side of the box. Schalke were stranded.
11',action,"Daniel Caligiuri coughed up the ball inside his own half, and Bayern wasted little time in punishing the new Schalke signing for his mistake. Weinzierl will be bitterly disappointed to concede that early."
9',assist,Assist Arturo Erasmo Vidal Pardo. Good pass down the outside of Lewandowski.
9',goal,"Goal Robert Lewandowski. FINISHED FOR THE OPENER! Robben's tenacity and a few deflections sees him keep the ball near the edge of the box. He gets it to Arturo Vidal, who feeds Robert Lewandowski to dink the ball over the keeper."
7',action,"A long ball down the right-hand side from Rafinha finds Arjen Robben well, and the Dutchman manufactures some space to send a cross in, which is diverted by Naldo for a corner, which comes to nothing."
5',action,"So far, Bayern haven't been able to accomplish much in possession. Schalke are allowing them to have the ball outside of their own defensive third, and there's not a whole lot of tempo to the home side's play."
3',action,"Manuel Neuer is forced off his line to get rid of some early pressure from Schalke, and nearly gets robbed of the ball thanks to an errant touch that takes him outside of the penalty area."
1',action,Off we go!
,action,The players are shaking hands and we're just about set for the start.
,action,"Max Meyer has been excluded due to rib bruising, while Klaas-Jan Huntelaar is also out of the squad as he continues his recovery from a long-term knee injury. New signing Guido Burgstaller shakes off a minor concern to start, but Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting is only fit enough for the bench."
,action,"Arturo Vidal starts after a return to training this week, with Thiago on the bench. Franck Ribery's injury means that Douglas Costa begins on the left flank. Javi Martinez partners Mats Hummels in defence with Jerome Boateng and Joshua Kimmich unavailable."
,action,"Schalke subs: Geis, Konoplyanka, Choupo-Moting, Kehrer, Nastasic, Avdijaj, Nubel."
,action,"Schalke (3-5-2): Fahrmann; Howedes, Naldo, Badstuber; Caligiuri, Bentaleb, Stambouli, Goretzka, Kolasinac; Schopf, Burgstaller."
,action,"Bayern subs: Thiago, Lahm, Ulreich, Alaba, Coman, Renato Sanches, Benko."
,action,"Bayern (4-2-3-1): Neuer; Rafinha, Martinez, Hummels. Bernat; Vidal, Alonso; Robben, Muller, Costa; Lewandowski."
,action,"Schalke have lost five of their last seven games in all competitions, a run which has seen them drop to 11th in the table. Markus Weinzierl's side do boast a good defensive record away from home though, with only three teams in the top flight conceding less than them."
,action,"Bayern have won eight straight in all competitions, and have managed to take a three-point lead over RB Leipzig just past the halfway mark of the season. It's a busy February for the Bavarian giants, as they have DFB-Pokal and Champions League matches to contend with this month."
,action,"Hello and welcome to our live commentary of the Bundesliga match between Bayern Munich and Schalke at the Allianz Arena. Both sides are in opposite veins of form, with 24 points separating them in the table."
