90',action,There will be a minimum of two minutes added time played.
88',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Craig Dawson. Another player to receive a yellow card, this time it is Craig Dawson for a cynical foul on Calvert-Lewin."

84',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Gareth Barry sub-in Dominic Calvert-Lewin . Everton make their final substitution of the game, with sub-out Gareth Barry coming off to be replaced by sub-in Dominic Calvert-Lewin who has recently returned from injury which has kept him sidelined since January."

82',goal,"Goal Romelu Lukaku Menama. GOOOAAALLL! IT'S THREE! Lukaku finally gets on the scoresheet, making this his most successful Premier League season in front of goal. It was a delightful ball into the box by Barkley and Lukaku rose highest and guided the ball into the back of the net with ease."

78',action,"West Brom have a corner, could this be the chance to half the deficit? No. The Everton defence have performed well all game and they clear the danger well."
76',substitution,Substitution sub-out Hal Robson-Kanu sub-in José Salomón Rondón Giménez . The second of a double substitution by the Baggies. The hardworking sub-out Hal Robson-Kanu is off and in his place up front is Salomón Rondón.

72',action,"Brief stoppage in play here as Jonny Evans is down receiving medical treatment, he looks like he will be fine to continue."
71',substitution,Substitution sub-out Kevin Mirallas sub-in Idrissa Gana Gueye . Another Everton substitution with the first goalscroer sub-out Kevin Mirallas coming off to be replaced by sub-in Idrissa Gana Gueye.
68',action,It looks like Tony Pulis has changed his mind about making any substitutions. James Morrison and Chris Brunt who were stripped and ready to go on have sat back down and are back in their training gear.
66',action,"The intensity of the game has dropped off in the last few minutes, with both teams struggling to keep the ball. Everton look happy with the scoreline and so they should be, they have rarely been threatened by the visitors here today."
64',action,"Looks like the Baggies might be about to make their first change of the game, they need to do something if they are to stand any chance of getting back into this game. Everton have dominated this second period."
61',action,"CHANCE EVERTON! Barkley twists and turns in the box and fires a shot from a very tight angle at goal which hits the side netting. He could have taken his shot earlier after beating McAuley, but he appeared to get the ball stuck under his feet before finally pulling the trigger."
60',action,"Half an hour left to play here at Goodison Park, so far West Brom haven't threatened to pull one back and Everton look keen to score a third."
59',action,"Robson-Kanu has cut a very isolated figure at times during the game as the Baggies have struggled to keep possession of the ball and feed the ball up to him. The Wales international hasn't played much football this season, so his fitness may be a concern to Pulis as the game progresses."
57',action,"STAT: Lukaku has 78 Premier League goals. Only three players in the history of the competition have scored more before their 24th birthday than the Belgian: Michael Owen (110), Robbie Fowler (106) and Wayne Rooney (86), while Lukaku now has one more than Cristiano Ronaldo (77)."
54',action,"Nice quick passing from Everton in the final third, but they try and be too elaborate and the Baggies win the ball back. However it isn't long before the Toffees come again with another attack. Complete control by the hosts."
52',action,"CHANCE! Much better from West Brom! Chadli picks up the ball around 30 yards from goal and tries to play Robon-Kanu through on goal, but he is well marked by Williams, so Chadli takes a shot at goal himself which is parried away by Robles."
51',action,"Every West Brom is back in their own half at the moment as Everton but them under pressure. Tha Baggies appear happy to keep the hosts outside of their final third, stepping up as soon as they venture too far forward."
49',action,"Everton have started this second half on top here, they are keeping possession well and making West Brom chase the ball. Davies and Lukaku are linking up well in attack but so far no chances have been created."

45'+2',action,That's the half-time whistle!

45',goal,"Goal Morgan Schneiderlin. GOOOAAALLL! EVERTON DOUBLE THEIR LEAD! The Toffees now have a commanding two-nil lead here at Goodison Park. Morgan Schneiderlin is the man to put the ball into the back of the net, after making a strong run into the box from midfield. Lukaku plays a lovely pass into the path of Schneiderlin who holds off the challenge of Livermore to loft the ball over Foster."
45',action,EVERTON PENALTY SHOUT! Coleman goes down in the box under heavy pressure from Livermore after the Toffees played the free-kick short. It appears the Everton right-back was tripped by Livermore but the referee waves away the appeals.
44',action,"Everton win another free-kick, this time down the right after McClean produced a late foul on Coleman. McClean pleads is innocence but he can have no complaints there."
43',action,"Dawson brings down Davies for a free-kick in a decent position for Everton. Mirallas to take the set piece down the left-wing, however the ball in fails to beat the wall. Not the best free-kick you'll ever see."
42',action,"Half-chance for West Brom to score an equaliser, as Livermore drags his left-footed shot not too far wide of the near post."
39',goal,"Goal Kevin Mirallas. GOOOAAALLL! EVERTON LEAD! Mirallas is the man to break the deadlock here at Goodison. Lukaku played the ball to Barkley who fired a first-time shot at goal, forcing Foster into making a good save, however the ball breaks loose and Mirallas is the man to pounce and slot home from close range. A few appeals for offside by the Baggies but Mirallas did well to stay onside and capitalise to give Everton the lead."
38',action,CHANCE! Chadli cuts inside and takes a shot at goal which looked to be heading into the corner of the net. However Joel Robles got down well and made a very good save. The resulting corner is easily cleared by Everton.
37',action,"Barkley tries to curl the ball into the top right-hand corner from the edge of the penalty area, but his effort is too high and sails over the goal."
36',action,"The Baggies have already scored more goals this season, than they did last season in total. Huge improvements by Pulis' side."
34',action,"Now it is West Brom's turn to win a corner as Robles flaps at a cross from the left. Chadli takes it but Lukaku clears at the near post, however West Brom keep the ball and Jake Livermore plays an excellent ball back to Chadli who whips it in again, but this time it is Barry who heads the ball away."
33',action,"Once again Barkley is on the ball trying to create an opportunity. The midfielder chips a ball into the box to Lukaku who tries to flick the ball to Barry who was making a surge into the box, however Evans reads it well and clears."
31',action,"Another Toffees corner which is played short, this time to Barry on the right-hand side, he plays it to Barkley who tries his luck from long range. However his effort doesn't have enough power behind it and it is straight at Foster who gathers with ease."
29',action,"Everton come forward again, Barkley is beginning to find more time and space in front of the Baggies defence. He passes to Tom Davies who has plenty of time to pick out a cross but it is well blocked by Craig Dawson. The resulting corner is played short to Baines who whips in a teasing ball which is met by Lukaku and goes just wide of the goal."
27',action,"Nyom goes on an excellent run from his own half to the Everton penalty area, he lays the ball off to James McClean who then tries to play a one-two with Robson-Kanu but Everton defend well and clear the danger. Better from the visitors."
25',action,"PENALTY SHOUT! Robson-Kanu is bundled to the ground from behind by his international teammate, Ashley Williams. The striker wants a penalty but it would have been a very soft penalty and the referee waves away any appeals from West Brom players."
23',action,"Still goalless here at Goodison Park, midway through the first half. Everton have gone the closest to opening the scoring and look the better team so far."
21',action,STAT: West Brom haven't kept a clean sheet in four consecutive away top-flight games against an opponent since March 1925 when they completed a run of five against Birmingham.
18',action,"West Brom now take their turn to attack, their first of the game. Nacer Chadli does well to find Dawson deep down the right wing. He gets to the byline and stands up a cross for Fletcher at the back post, but the skippers looping header is comfortable for Robles to gather."
16',action,"SO CLOSE! Lukaku goes incredibly close to opening the scoring! Gareth Barry lays the ball off to him teammate on the edge of the box, Lukaku takes a touch and fires a low shot at goal, which goes just inches wide of the Baggies goal from a tight angle, with Foster standing no chance of saving his effort."
15',action,"STAT: Romelu Lukaku has scored three goals in six Premier League games against his old club, but all of these have come at The Hawthorns."
13',action,"Excellent ball by Lukaku into the path of Mirallas on the edge of the box who turns and moves wide, trying to find space to cross the ball into the box. However Nyom does brilliantly to shepherd him out of touch, despite the protests from the Everton man."
11',action,Claudio Yacob draws a foul in the middle of the pitch and earns the Baggies some well needed rest bite here. However Ben Foster's free-kick is a poor one and goes straight out for a goal-kick to Everton.
9',action,The Baggies are finding it difficult to get a touch of the ball and Hal Robson-Kanu looks a very isolated figure for the visitors up front.
8',action,"The hosts are definitely on top at the moment, they are playing the ball around with ease and look threatening going forward down both flanks as Coleman and Leigton Baines join the attack at every opportunity."
5',action,Another Everton corner early on here as Allan Nyom puts the ball out of play. Seamus Coleman pops up down the left flank and fools the Baggies defence by crossing with his left foot. His cross is excellent but none of his teammates are on their toes and it misses everyone.
4',action,"Good start by Everton here. Kevin Mirallas does well to flick the ball past Jonny Evans, cut back inside onto his right foot and whip a cross into the box looking for Romelu Lukaku but Gareth McAuley does well to head the ball clear. The Toffess then come again, this time with Lukaku running at the West Brom defence and McAuley once again has to clear. Everton corner comes to nothing."
2',action,"Tony Pulis' side can close to within one point of the Toffees with a win, while Everton can pull away and consolidate seventh place with a victory themselves. If they pick up three points, Ronald Koeman's team will be two behind Manchester United in sixth - United will have two matches in hand - and seven points clear of West Brom."
