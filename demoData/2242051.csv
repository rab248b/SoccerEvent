16',action,"PENALTY SHOUT! Chelsea win a corner down the right as Sakho clears behind. From the resulting set-piece Hazard plays the ball short to Pedro, who strikes with power.

5',goal,Goal Francesc Fàbregas i Soler. GOALLLL!!! FABREGAS STRIKES! The Spaniard starts an ends the move as he picks out Hazard on the left to open up Palace before converting the Belgian's cross at the near post.

,action,"Victor Moses has not managed to make the game due to his own injury proble, while Willian drops out of the side that beat Stoke last time out. Cesc Fabregas comes into the side to replace Moses, while Hazard returns to the fold up front - which will see Pedro drop back into the wing-back slot."
