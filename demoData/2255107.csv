,action,"That's all for our live coverage, thanks for following along. Goodbye!"
,action,"Javi Martinez and Juan Bernat scored their first league goals of the season as Bayern hand Peter Stoger's side a first defeat of the campaign at the RheinEnergieStadion, with Franck Ribery adding a third late on as Die Roten widen their lead at the Bundesliga summit to seven points."
90',action,FULL-TIME: COLOGNE 0-3 BAYERN.
90',assist,"Assist Juan Bernat Velasco. A goal, a yellow card and now an assist for Bernat."
90',goal,"Goal Franck Bilal Ribéry. THERE'S THE DAGGER! Thiago sparks the move with a sensational run in midfield before springing Bernat down the left. The left-back draws all the attention before pulling it back for Ribery, who smashes home a finish!"
88',action,"Another offside flag denies Lewandowski a chance. It just hasn't been his night. In fact, while it's been a more than comfortable victory for Bayern, they really haven't had any one particular individual impress in attack - it's been a collective effort."
86',action,"Bayern's lead at the Bundesliga summit grows to seven points with the win today, barring any late drama, and up next for them is a trip to Arsenal on Tuesday in the Champions League, while Cologne will look to end their skid when they visit Ingolstadt next weekend."
84',action,"STAT: Bayern’s goals in their most recent away games at Ingolstadt (2-0) and Hertha (1-1) have all come in the 90th minute or later. Ancelotti’s side have scored six times in added time this term, equalling their best tally for a season since detailed data collection began in 2004/05."
82',substitution,Substitution sub-out Kingsley Coman sub-in Márcio Rafael Ferreira de Souza . Bayern's final change of the match sees Rafinha replace Coman.
81',action,"HUGE BLOCK! The substitutes link up here as Jojic produces a fine cross from the resulting set piece to pick out Maroh at the far post. The centre-back's downward header looks to be heading in, with Neuer scrambling to get across, but Lahm turns him aside! The resulting corner is dealt with by the visitors."
79',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Juan Bernat Velasco. Bernat is absolutely draped around Osako to try and deny the hard-working striker passage through into the area from near the byline. It results in a first yellow card of the season for the Spaniard, to go along with his first goal from earlier."
77',action,"HE'S MISSED A SITTER! The offside flag went up in the end anyhow, so it wouldn't have counted, but that's incredibly uncharacteristic of Lewandowski to miss the target from so close, with only keeper to beat. It certainly won't help alleviate frustrations on what has been a quiet afternoon for the Bayern striker."
75',action,"STAT: Cologne have failed to win any of the nine Bundesliga games where Modeste has not scored (averaging 0.7 points in those matches). In the 13 where the Frenchman has found the back of the net, they average 2.1 points (W8, D3, L2)."
73',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Arturo Erasmo Vidal Pardo sub-in Joshua Kimmich . Kimmich, who scored against Cologne in the 1-1 draw in the reverse fixture this season, replaces Vidal."
73',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Marco Höger sub-in Miloš Jojić . It's Hoger who is replaced by Jojic, the final change of the afternoon for the hosts."
71',action,"Both sides will be made to wait to make the change as play continues on here without a whistle. Cologne managed an attack in that spell, but Osako's deflected cross was guided safely into the arms of Neuer."
69',action,"Into the final quarter of the match now and Cologne are preparing their final change, another positive one it looks like, with Milo Jojic preparing. They can have as many attacking outlets as they want on the pitch, but it won't matter if they don't have the ball. Bayern have Joshua Kimmich readied as well."
67',action,"It's starting to open up a bit as Cologne take a few more chances in getting bodies forward, but they're leaving themselves exposed as a result, and Bayern don't need to be asked twice to attack - they look in the mood for a third."
65',action,STAT: Koln are faltering in their chase for a Europa League place as they have been in seventh place since matchday 13. The Billy Goats have taken just one point from their last three games (1-1 at home to Schalke).
63',substitution,Substitution sub-out Christian Clemens sub-in Artoms Rudņevs . Clemens sees his number called as he's the one to be replaced by Rudnevs.
62',action,"Fatigue is undoubtedly setting in for Cologne as they struggle to keep pressing, with the visitors so assured in possession. Artoms Rudnevs is up and ready for the hosts, who appear set to make their second switch of the afternoon."
60',action,"Bayern completely in control here as they pass it around at will just inside the attacking half, with Cologne unable to get as much as a sniff. Perhaps another change is necessary for the hosts."
58',action,The tempo has fizzled out a decent amount here as Bayern are content to play keep-away. Cologne need to start taking risks if they want to keep their unbeaten home record intact.
56',substitution,Substitution sub-out Frederik Hillesborg Sørensen sub-in Dominik Maroh . Cologne's first change of the afternoon sees sub-in Dominik Maroh replace Sorensen.
54',action,"STAT: Cologne have failed to beat any side this season currently ahead of them in the table (D3, L4). They lost 3-1 in Leipzig last time out."
52',substitution,Substitution sub-out Douglas Costa de Souza sub-in Franck Bilal Ribéry . Franck Ribery comes on to replace Costa.
50',action,"Douglas Costa pulls up lame after an innocuous attempt at goal, and immediately signals over to the bench as he clutches his thigh (or maybe his hamstring). Either way, it doesn't look promising for the Brazilian, who goes down to receive treatment as a substitute is prepared."
48',assist,"Assist Thomas Müller. Muller, who has been quiet thus far, produces a gem of a delivery at an opportune time as he's credited with the assist."
48',goal,"Goal Juan Bernat Velasco. THAT MIGHT DO IT! Absolutely superb vision from Muller to spot Bernat with a long pass, sending the full-back into the area, and the Spaniard makes the most of it, beating Kessler at the near post with the aid of a generous deflection off Olkowski."
47',action,"Cologne begin the second half on the front foot for an extended period. Zoller gets on the end of a cross, scuffing his half-volley wide, but the pressure stays on until an offside flag allows Bayern to regroup."
46',action,Here we go again!
,action,"So much attacking talent out on the pitch, yet it's Bayern centre-half Javi Martinez who has the only goal through 45 minutes, as the league leaders head into the interval deservedly in front."
45',action,HALF-TIME: COLOGNE 0-1 BAYERN.
43',action,STAT: Anthony Modeste has bagged 55 per cent of Cologne’s league goals this campaign (17/31). No other player has scored more than 36 per cent of his side’s Bundesliga goals (Werder’s Serge Gnabry).
41',action,"Osako is proving a real threat in the air, latching onto yet another Modeste cross here, following some good play from Heintz. The striker tries to guide his header in at the far post, but he was a bit too far out to really test Neuer there."
39',action,"The tempo remains lively and it's made for some attractive football. Cologne are packing bodies behind the ball, but when they counter they aren't hesitant in doing so with numbers, which in turns helps open things up for Bayern on their subsequent attacks."
37',action,"Vidal unloads a stinging effort from range that Kessler can only block. He produces a juicy rebound for Bayern to attack, but neither Muller or Lewandowski can sort their footing to keep it out."
35',action,"Osako again rises well to meet the cross from the ensuing set piece, but his flicked-on header winds up drifting harmlessly behind for a goal-kick."
34',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Arturo Erasmo Vidal Pardo. Vidal goes into the book for a clumsy challenge, awarding Cologne a free-kick in a dangerous area."
33',action,"Cologne are falling out of favour here, but still showing the odd sign of life. It's obviously fairly difficult for them to take the game to the visitors when they're seeing so little of the ball."
31',action,"STAT: Bayern have won 10 of their last 12 league games in Cologne (D1, L1 – 3-2 in February 2011). They scored in all of those matches (28 in total, 2.3 on average)."
29',action,"NEARLY DISASTER! Coman is sprung behind the defence but he lacks support and opts to try his luck from a difficult angle. Kessler makes a meal of the strike, allowing it to bounce through his legs and squirt out to the far post, but no one is on hand for Bayern to take advantage!"
27',action,"Cologne, without a home defeat in the league since April, are up against it now. The dangers of Bayern are known all to well, but they're an even scarier prospect when playing from behind. Everyone will have to do their part for the hosts to turn this around."
25',assist,Assist Arturo Erasmo Vidal Pardo. Vidal is credited with the assist from his delightful pull-back.
25',goal,"Goal Javier Martínez Aginaga. AND THERE'S THE BREAKTHROUGH! The unlikeliest of scorers for Bayern as Martinez manages to wriggle away from his marker and guide a delightful finish into the top corner on the end of Vidal's pull-back, for his first goal of the season!"
23',action,STAT: Peter Stoger’s side are unbeaten in 12 home Bundesliga games (since April 2016’s 2-0 loss vs. Leverkusen). They’ve conceded just six goals in that timeframe.
21',action,"Back and forth they go! Chances at both ends starting to accumulate here! Clemens puts his side under unnecessary pressure with a horrifically sliced clearance. The ball is eventually worked out wide for Coman, who picks out Lewandowski with his cross, but Kessler manages to foil the striker!"
19',action,"SENSATIONAL SAVE! A stop out of the top drawer from Neuer, flinging himself high in the air, at full-stretch to his left as he gets his fingertips to a brilliantly placed header from Osako!"
17',action,"LOVELY HIT! That's a tremendous bit of skill from Costa, working in a small space, but he manages to open up just enough of a look to have a shot from 25 yards, forcing Kessler into a smart save to parry behind for a corner."
15',action,"Bayern have a good width about them, but that can also be attributed to some good play from Cologne to keep them to the outside. The visitors have been relegated to crossing balls in for Lewandowski, with the striker unable to get his head to one yet."
13',action,"This has been some excellent play from Cologne over the last few minutes to limit Bayern in possession and keep them in the midfield third when they do have the ball. It will be a tall order to keep this focus through the 90 minutes, but confidence will be growing."
11',action,"Cologne enjoy a decent spell in possession, but they're forced to knock the ball out of play as Modeste goes to ground and stays there after taking a knock in the back of the head from Alaba. There's arguably no one player more valuable to their side in the Bundesliga than Modeste, but he pops back to his feet after a few moments and looks alright to continue."
9',action,STAT: Cologne ended a six-game losing run vs. Bayern earlier this season (1-1). They were the first points dropped by Carlo Ancelotti in the Bundesliga.
7',action,"Bayern get back the other way in a flash and win themselves a corner. It's played high towards the top of the box for Coman to have a shot, but his volley is blocked. Pressure stays on and Lewandowski goes down in the area looking for a penalty, but play on says the referee."
5',action,"Decent threat! Zoller, who has featured largely off the bench this season, but starts today with Hector suspended, puts in some clever running on the edge of the box before sending a glancing ball across the face of goal, but an alert Neuer does well to dive off his line and pluck it away from harm."
3',action,"Packed house today at the RheinEnergieStadion as these Cologne supporters do their part to help the hosts maintain their unbeaten home record on the season, but it's going to be a tough test this afternoon, as can already been seen in the first few minutes with Bayern dominating possession."
1',action,"AND THEY'RE OFF! Bayern in red, attacking right to left as they get us underway, with Cologne in white."
,action,"Carlo Ancelotti has no fresh injury or suspensions to worry about, with a full squad at his disposal. The Italian boss has made just two changes from last weekend's emphatic 8-0 win over Hamburg. Juan Bernat and Kingsley Coman are brought into the XI, with Mats Hummels and Arjen Robben afforded a rest, though both have been included amongst the subs."
,action,"Peter Stoger makes two changes to his side from the defeat to RB Leipzig last weekend. Frederik Sorensen returns from suspension and slots in at the back, at the expense of Dominic Maroh, while Jonas Hector is forced to miss out through a ban and is replaced in midfield by Simon Zoller."
,action,"SUBS: Ribery, Hummels, Ulreich, Alonso, Kimmich, Robben, Rafinha."
,action,"BAYERN (4-2-3-1): Neuer; Lahm, Martinez, Alaba, Bernat; Thiago, Vidal; Coman, Muller, Costa; Lewandowski."
,action,"SUBS: Rudnevs, Jojic, Klunter, Hartel, Muller, Ciftci, Maroh."
,action,"COLOGNE (3-5-2): Kessler; Sorensen, Subotic, Heintz; Olkowski, Clemens, Hoger, Zoller, Rausch; Osako, Modeste."
,action,CONFIRMED TEAM NEWS:
,action,"Peter Stoger’s side have fallen out of the race of top-four due to recent results, and it will take some doing for them to pull themselves back in. They currently sit five points back of Hoffenheim, but with three teams ahead of them and Leverkusen lurking from the rear, Cologne can ill-afford to let any more points slip."
,action,"Cologne have put together an impressive season of their own, though they find themselves in the midst of a poor run of form, losing three of their last four across all competitions, as many defeats as they suffered all season before this current run – and here enters Bayern, stage right."
,action,"Despite their scintillating form, Bayern remain just four points ahead of RB Leipzig at the Bundesliga summit, albeit with a game in hand. That being said, while the surprise title challengers continue to push the defending champions, Bayern are showing no signs of cracking."
,action,"It is more than safe to say Bayern have rediscovered their world-beater form. Carlo Ancelotti’s side have scored 17 goals over their last four games and have not tasted defeat since late-November, dropping points just twice over that span."
,action,Hello and welcome to live coverage from the RheinEnergieStadion as Champions League hopefuls Cologne put their European pedigree to the test when they host high-flying Bayern Munich!
