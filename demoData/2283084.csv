,action,"FULL-TIME! Real Madrid lose! Their lead at the top is cut, with their long 40-game unbeaten run at an end. Jovetic's late strike takes the three points, with an own goal helping Sampaoli's men to a 2-1 victory. Ronaldo's penalty seems a long time ago now! What a turn-around at the end. Though Zidane's men have a game in hand, the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan is absolutely bouncing. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+1',assist,"Assist Víctor Machín Pérez. Vitolo flights in a ball from the left-hand side, and the substitute does the rest!"
90'+1',goal,"Goal Stevan Jovetić. GOOOOOOOOOAL! JOVETIC MAKES IT 2-1! SAMPAOLI GOES CRAZY! The ex-Inter forward gets to the edge of the penalty area and curls home a wonderful goal, with Navas unable to keep the ball out with his one glove."
90',action,There are three minutes of stoppage time.
89',action,"Sevilla win themselves another free-kick, but Sarabia is unable to make the most of this most recent one. Sampaoli is practically jogging around his technical area, he is itching for his team to get the ball forward. Real Madrid are patiently sat back, waiting for the chance to counter."
87',action,"Sevilla are really pushing on now, with the stadium urging their players on. Sampaoli's men are streaming forward, with Real Madrid forced to defend the edge of their penalty area. Sarabia has been a livewire since coming into the game."
86',substitution,Substitution sub-out Wissam Ben Yedder sub-in Luciano Vietto . Vietto replaces Ben Yedder for the dying stages.
85',own-goal,"Own Goal Sergio Ramos García. GOOOOOOOAL! AN OWN GOAL! Sarabia bends in a free-kick, which Varane misses entirely. The Frenchman is pushed by Ramos, who then plants the delivery into the back of his own net. Unbelievable scenes, and it isn't clear which man is to blame."
84',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Marcelo Vieira da Silva Júnior. Marcelo throws himself into an untidy challenge on Mariano, which earns the Brazilian a yellow card due to the ferocious of his entry."
83',action,"Sarabia tries to slide a pass through the lines for Vitolo to meet on the overlap, but Varane is there to cut the ball out. Sevilla are relentlessly pushing forward and tries to force the issue, but Real Madrid are ensuring that the edge of their penalty area is very congested indeed."
81',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Samir Nasri. Nasri picks up a yellow card, with frustrations starting to show late on from the home side."
81',action,"Casemiro is caught on the top of his foot, which will be a sore one for the Brazilian midfielder. He rolls over a few times, before getting gingerly back to his feet, but the referee will have to be wary of any attempts to wind down the clock from Real Madrid. They have a narrow lead, after all."
79',action,"Sevilla have a couple of fleeting chances in the opposite half, with N'Zonzi getting riled up by some refereeing decisions not going the hosts' way. Given that he was booked for dissent earlier on, the Frenchman needs to be careful not to get into further trouble."
77',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Vicente Iborra De La Fuente sub-in Pablo Sarabia García . Iborra is taken off after his earlier booking, with Sarabia hoping to offer a little more offensive spark in the dying stages. The former Getafe winger has been able to chip in with a very important goals so far this season, after joining the club in the summer."
75',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Toni Kroos sub-in Mateo Kovačić . Kovacic is injected into the fray for the away side, with Kroos taking his leave. Zidane is hoping that fresh legs can help his team over the line."
75',action,"Marcelo breaks down the left-hand side, and then drills in a low cross, but the ball from the Brazilian is gathered up simply by Sergio Rico. Jovetic is picked out in the penalty area, before forcing a save out of Navas, but Iborra is penalised for being offside in the build-up."
73',action,"Sampaoli's men are having all of the ball, with Ben Yedder and Jovetic camped on the edge of the penalty area. Escudero scampers down the left-hand side and gets to the byline, but the wing-back's cross is easily gobbled up by Navas."
71',action,"Real Madrid are happy to sit back and absorb plenty of pressure, with Benzema and Ronaldo being left up top as a duo. Less than 20 minutes remain for Sevilla to turn this one around, but the visitors' long unbeaten record isn't looking at any imminent threat."
69',action,"Sevilla are trying to be more aggressive and push upfield with intent, but now they have to be careful of Real Madrid countering and putting the game to bed. Nasri and Vitolo combine down the left, with Escudero found overlapping, but the Spaniard's cross doesn't find the head of Ben Yedder."
68',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Franco Damián Vázquez sub-in Stevan Jovetić . Vazquez takes his leave, with Jovetic adding a more orthodox striking presence into the mix for Sevilla."
67',penalty-goal,"Penalty Goal Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro. GOOOOOOOOAL! RONALDO CONVERTS FROM THE SPOT! There is a bit of controversy, as the Portuguese striker has a brief disagreement with some Sevilla players. It doesn't put him off, however, as the Real Madrid forward drills a low finish into the bottom corner."
66',yellow-card,Yellow Card Sergio Escudero Palomo. N'Zonzi gets a booking for showing his frustrations with the referee's decision.
66',action,"PENALTY FOR REAL MADRID! Carvajal races down the right-hand side and gets to the byline, before going down. The referee points straight to the spot, but the hosts' players are absolutely incensed. The goalkeeper might have got a touch of the ball, but the official doesn't see it that way."
64',action,"Real Madrid manage to pounce on an error in midfield, with Benzema afforded the chance to shoot. Modric did well to put the ball on a plate for his team-mate, but the Frenchman blasts a long way over the crossbar. Sevilla are starting to make a few costly errors - but the visitors aren't punishing them for it."
62',action,"Ronaldo is found on the edge of the penalty area, before trying to cut onto his right foot. The Portuguese striker, however, is caught in possession yet again. He doesn't appear to be at his sharpest this evening, that much is clear. Ben Yedder and Vazquez try to combine on the edge of the area, but Escudero is then penalised for a trip on Ramos."
60',action,"Benzema rushes forward on the break, before trying to find Ramos out on the right-hand side, as the centre-back marauds forward. The Spaniard takes a poor first touch, however, much to the delight of the home fans. Zidane applauds the efforts of his captain."
58',action,"The home side are still enjoying much more of the ball, but they're not going anywhere with it. Both coaches might be thinking about making a substitution to try and change the shape of this game. Zidane appears as though he would be happy with a point tonight."
56',action,"Ronaldo tries to drill in a low cross from the right-hand side, but Sergio Rico comes off his line well to palm the ball away from Benzema. Rami and Escudero have a mix-up while trying to clear, but the hosts eventually manage to hoof the ball away from the danger zone."
55',action,"Vitolo and Vazquez combine, with the Italian managing to pick out Ben Yedder on the right-hand side. The ex-Toulouse striker thumps a low finish towards the bottom-left corner, but Navas gets  down well to push the ball to safety. Smart stop from him."
54',action,"Nasri makes his way forward down the left-hand side, before the Frenchman flicks a pass onwards to find Vazquez in an offside position. Sevilla continue to dominate possession in this second half, but both Navas and Sergio Rico haven't had a great deal of tests. Real Madrid are still being very defensive."
52',action,"Real Madrid threaten down the right-hand side, with Modric gallivanting into the penalty area. The Croatia international takes a tumble, claiming a foul, but it appears that the midfielder's momentum took him into Rami. Moments later, Marcelo cut infield from the left, but shoots high of the far post with his right foot."
50',action,"Sevilla earn themselves a free-kick on the right-hand side, but Real Madrid deal with the danger well. The hosts are continuing to dominate possession and call the shots, with Benzema and Ronaldo looking quite isolated at the head of the attack in this second half."
48',action,"Vitolo twists and turns, before driving in a low cross from the left-hand side, but Ramos does well to get in ahead of Vazquez and clear behind for a corner. The set-piece is taken short, and Escudero delivers, but the away manage to get the ball away well."
46',action,"We are underway in the second half! This game is very delicately poised as we head into the last 45 minutes. If Sevilla can win here tonight, Real Madrid's lead at the top of La Liga will be temporarily cut to just one point."
,action,"HALF-TIME! The two sides head in goalless, as Zidane's system has the desired effect at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan. Ronaldo has had the best chance of the half, after firing wide from eight yards out, but neither coach will be entirely happy. Chances have been hard to come by, which couldn't have been said about their last meeting in the Copa del Rey."
45',action,"Marcelo guides a cross in from the left-hand side, but Sevilla deal with it easily. That should be just about that from a breathless first half."
43',action,"Vitolo flashes a cross in from the left-hand side, but Ramos is present to hack a rushed clearance away from the danger zone. Escudero has the chance to take a quick throw-in, but N'Zonzi is then penalised for shoving Casemiro over. The Frenchman thumps the ball into the advertising hoardings in frustration."
41',action,"Sevilla looked to be under heavy pressure, but this game is so open that they can be upfield themselves in a flash. N'Zonzi gets his foot on the ball and tries to calm things down, as Los Nervionenses can't afford to slip a goal behind just before the break."
39',action,"Benzema is found making progress down the left-hand side, before cutting a neat pass back from the byline towards Ronaldo. The Portugal international tries to shoot from around eight yards out, but didn't get the contact required to guide the ball inside the far post. He shoots wide."
37',action,"Sampaoli is pacing around his technical area, looking rather frustrated at the moment. The away side's game-plan is silencing the hosts so far. If Zidane was just hoping to get into the break unscathed with his back five, it is working. Modric races forward on the break for the visitors, but the Croatian midfielder's forward pass is inaccurate."
35',action,"Benzema and Ronaldo are dropping very deep to try and get involved for the away side. Sergio Rico has only had one save to make so far, with Casemiro and Modric doing their best to sprint forward in support whenever they can."
33',action,"With narrowly over 10 minutes remaining in this first half, Sevilla are struggling to find a way through this resilient Real Madrid defence. Ben Yedder is looking incredibly isolated, despite Vazquez and Nasri trying to get close to the Frenchman."
31',action,"Vitolo tries to play a one-two with Nasri, but Carvajal manages to hack the danger away. Ronaldo tries to lead a break moments later, but Iborra is penalised for cynically tugging on the shirt of the Portugal international to halt a rare dangerous break-away for the away side."
31',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Vicente Iborra De La Fuente. Iborra gets the first yellow card of the game, in what has been largely a mild-mannered affair."
29',action,"Sampaoli's men are probing for a gap, going from flank to flank, but Real Madrid's midfield five is doing its job so far. Carvajal and Marcelo are so deep, that it is often a back five, with Modric covering the right-hand side. Escudero looks for Vazquez in behind, but the Italian midfielder is caught narrowly offside."
27',action,"Marcelo curls a cross in from the left-hand side, but Pareja heads half-clear, before Ronaldo is caught offside in the aftermath following a hopeful second delivery from Varane. Moments later, the Portugal international is fed in behind Sevilla's back four, but Sergio Rico makes a simple save."
25',action,"Varane is almost caught out on the edge of his own penalty area, as he affords N'Zonzi the chance to steal possession from him, but Carvajal recovers to spare his team-mate's blushes. Moments later, Nasri takes a shot, but it sails high and wide of the target. Ben Yedder might have been a better option."
23',action,"Marcelo is found sprinting down the left-hand side, but Mariano steps out to make a fantastic sliding tackle. Sevilla try to kick-start a break, but Ramos makes a good interception, before wasting possession himself with an audacious lofted pass upfield. The home side are dominating the ball, but chances are proving elusive."
21',action,"Vazquez and Casemiro both throw themselves into feisty tackles, as this game continues to be more of a midfield battle than anything else. Carvajal and Marcelo are yet to get involved in the final third, with Zidane's 3-5-2 system only managing to crowd out Ben Yedder so far."
19',action,"Varane is forced to head yet another dangerous ball away from his penalty area, with Sevilla earning themselves a corner on the left-hand side. Nasri bends the set-piece in, but Varane manages to get up high to unsight N'Zonzi. The French midfielder flicks his headed effort high over the crossbar."
17',action,"The home side are having a lot of the ball, with Real Madrid forced to sit back in deep fashion. Nasri tries to swing in a cross from deep on the right, but Varane is there to slice his compatriot's delivery away. Navas hasn't had anything to do yet - but neither has Sergio Rico."
15',action,"Kroos bends in a cross from the right-hand side, but Ramos can only rise highest to glance a header a long way over the crossbar. The home fans aren't taking too kindly to anything the Real Madrid captain contributes to this game! Few clear-cut chances on show, as we edge over the 15-minute mark."
13',action,"Pareja clips a great ball up to Vitolo, who nods down a header nicely. Nasri tries to find the Spanish winger out the left, but Carvajal intercepts. Moments later, Sevilla threaten down the same flank, but Varane nods a Escudero cross to safety easily."
11',action,"Sevilla have seen much more of the ball in these early stages, with Real Madrid struggling to get upfield at pace. Escudero is released down the left-hand side for the hosts, but Carvajal covers across to bully the ex-Getafe wing-back off the ball. He lets it run behind for a goal-kick - good defending."
9',action,"Beautiful stuff from Modric. Carvajal plays a pass down the right wing, with the Croatia international turning Rami inside-out with a lovely flick. He marauds to the byline and cuts back a cross, but his floated delivery doesn't meet anybody in a purple shirt."
8',action,"Casemiro leads a charge forward from the away side, with Benzema then flicking possession out wide to Marcelo. The Brazilian scampers into the box, but a combination of N'Zonzi and Mariano frustrates him. Nasri is then guilty of fouling Casemiro on the edge of the area. Ronaldo stands over it, but the Portuguese striker blasts an effort into the wall."
6',action,"Real Madrid are struggling to break upfield at pace, as they need to retain possession for a while to allow Marcelo and Carvajal to get forward in support. Ronaldo has only had a couple of touches, but hasn't been able to conjure anything up. Zidane may well be hoping to just settle into the game using this formation."
5',action,"Possession is being given away very cheaply so far, as the midfield third is very congested indeed. Sevilla are happy to try and play patiently out from the back, but this early stages of this game may well be quite cagey. Neither coach wants to be the one to fall behind."
3',action,"Sergio Ramos is getting a rather angry reception tonight, after his goal celebration earlier in the week in this very stadium. Real Madrid are indeed using three central defenders, with Marcelo and Carvajal asked to bring the width. For Sevilla, N'Zonzi is dropping deep, enabling Escudero and Mariano to push right on. A real tactical battle in the opening exchanges."
1',action,"We are underway in the first half in Seville! Real Madrid have a long unbeaten record and a lead at the top of La Liga to protect, but the way that Zidane has set up tonight suggests that Los Blancos should be up for one of their toughest away games of the campaign so far. You don't want to miss this one!"
