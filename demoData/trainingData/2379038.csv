,action,"Full-time at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea comfortably make it into the next round of the FA Cup with a comfortable 4-1 win at home over Peterbrough, with a double from Pedro and goals from Batshuayi and Willian ensuring progression depite a second half red card for John Terry. Thanks for joining us, see you next time."
90'+2',action,"McGee comes to the rescue for the Posh again as he dives down to his left-hand side to deny Batshuayi his second goal. The Belgian, Pedro, and Kante, all somehow combine and conspire to not score the fifth goal despite several opportunities."
90',action,"Three minutes of added time have been signalled by the referee which is only really prolonging the inevitable agony for Peterborough. Fair play to the travelling fans, though, who have been in full voice for pretty much the full 90 minutes. Great support."
88',action,"With the visitors pressing forward, Chelsea break free on the counter with plenty of players being sent forward into opposition territory. Batshuayi sees one last potential opportunity to claim another place on the scoresheet as he has a crack from the edge of the box, but it never ends up bothering McGee between the sticks."
86',action,"A good period of sustained pressure from Peterborough at the moment but it is coming too little, too late for the League One side as this game was gone when Pedro banged in the fourth goal. Angol in particular will wonder what might have been as he really should have scored early on from that headed opportunity."
84',substitution,Substitution sub-out Andrew Hughes sub-in Jerome Binnom-Williams . Third and final change from McCann as Binnom-Williams comes on for sub-out Andrew Hughes.
83',action,"A very slight penalty shout for Chelsea now as Batshuayi once again collects the ball inside the box to feet with his back to goal, attempting to shake off the attentions of his marker to get the shot away. Bostwick is the defender in question and uses his strength to eventually usher the Belgian off the ball. Never a spotkick."
81',action,Some really professional work from Chelsea at the moment as they look to run down the clock without incident. Fabregas in particular has been superb in the past few minutes or so as he picks out the right pass every time into space on the left and right wing. Plenty of space is being created on the flanks as the visitors push forward for another consolation.
79',action,"We get our first real glimpse of Aina since the youngster's introduction as he drives down the right flank with pace before looking for a team-mate inside. The cross eventually comes, but without too much precision which allows Peterborough to clear, catalysing a counterattack of their own in the process."
77',action,"You have to hand some credit to Conte as when Terry got sent off the former Juventus boss reacted rather quickly and although Chelsea conceded not long after, the introductions of Kante and Azpilicueta have indeed given the Blues some needed experience in defending out the lead. This should go down as a good day at he office for the Premier League leaders."
75',assist,Assist Michy Batshuayi Tunga. Assist for Batshuayi.
75',goal,"Goal Pedro Eliezer Rodríguez Ledesma. GOOOOAAAAAAALLLL FOR CHELSEA! Pedro bags his second! Just as the Posh would have been looking to mount a final charge on the opposition goal, the game goes beyond them again as the Spaniard collects a short pass from Batshuayi before curling a beauty of a finish into the bottom right corner. Four-one, lovely goal."
74',action,"Just over 15 minutes to go at Stamford Bridge and all of a sudden, things aren't quite as comfortable as they might have been for Chelsea at this stage. It is still a healthy two-goal lead for the home side, but with Peterborough now prospering under the man-advantgage they just need to guard against complacency."
72',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Willian Borges Da Silva sub-in N'Golo Kanté . Another pragmatic substitution from Antonio Conte now as he withdraws an attacker, Willian, in favour of the more defensively-minded N'Golo Kante, who will certainly add some steel in the middle of the park. Quite a bit of respect being shown to Peterborough with these changes."
70',assist,"Assist Lee Angol. Angol probably should have scored, but he will settle for the assist for his strike partner!"
70',goal,"Goal Tom Nichols. GOOOOAAAAALLLL FOR PETERBOROUGH! What a couple of minutes for the visitors! Moments after going a man up, the League One side claw a goal back too as Nichols pops up with a predatory finish at the back post following a flick-on by Angol. Three-one."
69',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Ruben Loftus-Cheek sub-in César Azpilicueta Tanco . That was certainly not in the script for Chelsea as Conte's men now find themselves in an unnecessarily umcomfortable position after Terry's dismissal, which although harsh was probably the correct decision by the referee. The Italian boss goes to solidify things by bringing on Azpilicueta for Loftus-Cheek."
67',red-card,"Red Card John Terry. CHELSEA ARE DOWN TO 10 MEN AS TERRY IS SENT OFF! Angol has became a real menace towards the opposition defence in the past few minutes and on this occasion skips past the Chelsea captain, who is forced to concede the foul whilst standing as the last man! A small ray of hope for the Posh now."
64',action,"Angol gets the wrong side of Ivanovic and looks to open up his considerable stride to break into the penalty box, only to be brought down by the trailing leg of the Serbian. Bostwick is the man tasked with the resulting free-kick and he steps up to fire a cannon at goal only for the Chelsea wall to remain sturdy to make the clearance. Brave defending from Ivanovic in the end."
62',action,"The game is playing out like an exhibition fixture at the moment as Peterborough are struggling for motivation, and indeed fitness, as we enter the final third of proceedings. You get the feeling that the final scoreline today may depend on how ambitious Chelsea are feeling going forward."
60',action,"That is an interesting couple of changes from McCann in the dugout for Peterborough. Edwards and Maddison have arguably been two of the better performers in his side so far this afternoon, but with the game now likely out of reach is he opting to rest the duo for future League One challenges?"
58',substitution,Substitution sub-out Gwion Edwards sub-in Martin Samuelsen . A double change from the Posh. The first sees Edwards leave the pitch to be replaced by sub-in Martin Samuelsen.
57',substitution,Substitution sub-out Marcus Maddison sub-in Paul Taylor . The second sees sub-in Paul Taylor come on for sub-out Marcus Maddison.
57',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Gary Cahill sub-in Temitayo Olufisayo Olaoluwa Aina . Three changes over the two sides just before the hour mark. For Chelsea, Cahill is given a rest and he will be replaced by Temitayo Aina."
56',action,"The rain is starting to play a bigger part in proceedings now as players are having to take a yard or two off their passes to team-mates in fear the ball will slip away. Indeed, as Chalobah clips a pass down the left flank for Pedro you can't help but feeling the Spaniard would have caught it in the first half when the surface wasn't quite as wet."
54',action,"Moments before Chelsea scored that damaging third goal, Peterborough could probably have took a slight bit of heart from the fact that Bradford were 2-0 down against the Blues at half-time two years ago in the FA Cup, only to go on and cause a shock with a 4-2 victory. A comeback from the Posh here would eclipse even that feat massively, but it really does not look remotely possible."
52',assist,Assist Pedro Eliezer Rodríguez Ledesma. Pedro turns provider this time as he easily picks out Willian for the third.
52',goal,"Goal Willian Borges Da Silva. GOOOOOAAAAAAAALLLL FOR CHELSEA! Peterborough are caught out with a criminally high line and the hosts take advantage once again as Pedro steamrolls down the left-flank to collect a pass over the top. He eventually picks out Willian on the edge of the area, with the Brazilian subsequently whipping an emphatic finish int the corner past McGee. Three-nil!"
50',action,"The heavens have opened in this part of London as rain now streams down on to the pitch here at Stamford Bridge. This will probably play straight into the hands of Chelsea as in the first half Conte's men looked dangerous on the counter, especially when previously pouncing on misplaced passed from the Posh."
48',action,"Chelsea should be three up ALREADY in this second period! As Peterborough attempt to play out from the back, Fabregas steals possession in a dangerous area before threading a perfect pass through the middle for Loftus-Cheek. The Englishman opens up his body to try and ease an attempt low towards the bottom corner, but it goes JUST wide of the right-hand post."
46',action,We are back under way at Stamford Bridge.
,action,"Half-time at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea are on course to make it to the next round of the FA Cup and avoid a shock in the process as they go into the break with a 2-0 lead over Peterborough, with Pedro and Batshuayi the men getting on the scoresheet so far. Long way back for the Posh with the second period coming up."
45',action,Two minutes of added time have been allocated by the referee here so McCann will be very eager for his side to not suffer any more damage before the team-talk. He will be furious at the manner of the way his side conceded that second.
43',assist,Assist Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Unselfish work from Loftus-Cheek as he chests down for his team-mate to score.
43',goal,"Goal Michy Batshuayi Tunga. GOOOOAAAAAALLLLL FOR CHELSEA! The Blues double the lead! With Peterborough caught insanely high up the park, Willian takes advantage to drive down the right wing with pace before clipping a searching cross to the back post for Loftus-Cheek, who cleverly chests into the path of Batshuayi. The Belgian finally gets his goal with a lashed finish into the left corner. Two-nil!"
42',action,"Edwards takes the pressure off his defence with a marauding run down the right wing and eventually hits the by byline before smashing a wicked cross to the front post. Begovic struggles to get there, but luckily for him Zouma is positioned perfectly to make the vital interception out of the box."
40',action,"ANOTHER SAVE FROM MCGEE! Pedro again manages to get into a great position inside the box, but this time passes rather than going for goal despite the sight on target. Willian is the man eventually tasked with pulling the trigger, which he does from 18 yards out, but the Peterborough goalkeeper makes the solid save with his feet."
38',action,"Edwards sends a poor pass out of defence and Chelsea pounce thanks to their high pressing on this occasion. Batshuayi eventually picks up the ball to feet, once again with his back to goal, but rather incredibly opts to not to pass to Willian who is standing completely free to the right of the area, instead going for the shot himself. Nothing comes of the attack in the end as the Brazilian is left frustrated at his team-mate."
36',action,"Well, the Chelsea fans rise out of their seats in protest here as Zouma is completely taken out by Nichols in the middle of the park after a late tackle from the Peterborough midfielder. The French defender has only very recently came back from a serious knee injury, so you can see why the Stamford Bridge faithful are looking for some punishment to be administered. No yellow is brandished by the ref."
34',action,"OH WHAT A HORRIBLE MISS FROM PEDRO! Willian slides a perfect pass down the right channel for Loftus-Cheek, who powers forward before smashing a strike at goal which is saved. The Englishman collects the rebound and finds the former Barcelona man at the back post, who cuts inside past the defender only to CRACK an attempt off the bar from five yards out! The goal was gaping!"
33',yellow-card,Yellow Card Ryan Tafazolli. Tafazolli sees yellow for the Posh.
32',action,"Batshuayi did cost Chelsea quite a bit of money so you would be expecting a certain amount of quality for that sum. However, Conte hasn't trusted him to start even one Premier League match so far, so the confidence of the Belgian isn't exactly going to be soaring in his attempts to find the back of the net here."
30',action,"Willian comes deep to see a bit more of the ball and swiftly turns on the right channel before leaving his marker for dead with a darting run through the middle. The Brazilian slides a neat pass into space for the onrushing Batshuayi, but the subsequent strike on goal is saved comfortably by McGee between the sticks."
28',action,"Batshuayi, who has been quiet so far, receives the ball to feet inside the box and uses his strength impressively to turn sharply, looking to get a shot away. However, even with the opportunity to go down for the penalty, he decides to go on only to be successfully dispossessed by Tafazolli."
26',action,"It has been a decent reaction from the Posh since going a goal behind, but they need to press a little higher up the pitch to put pressure on this Chelsea defence which haven't played a lot of football together this season."
24',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Francesc Fàbregas i Soler. A bit of retribution has been taken out by Fabregas here as it was he who came on the wrong end of that Forrester challenge previously. Again, though, the Spaniard is unlucky to see yellow as he takes out Nichols on the touchline whilst getting a big portion of the ball."
22',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Chris Forrester. We have our first booking of the match now and it is actually a fairly harsh one of Forrester who goes into a 50-50 altercation with Fabregas a yard or so outside of the Peterborough box. Chelsea get the free-kick which Willian takes, but it ends up being disappointingly slammed into the wall."
20',action,"That must be fairly heartbreaking for Peterborough, as they have actually acquitted themselves admirably in the opening period of the match only to now be behind. It was a moment of magic from Pedro, really, but Chelsea will have the confidence to go on and take control of proceedings now."
18',goal,"Goal Pedro Eliezer Rodríguez Ledesma. GOOOOOAAAAAAAALLL FOR CHELSEA! THE HOSTS TAKE THE LEAD! Some nice link-up play on the edge of the box eventually sees Chalobah fire a strike at goal, which is saved by McGee. Pedro collects the rebound and superbly cuts inside past the tackle of Forrester before firing a stunning finish into the top right corner! One-nil."
15',action,"Peterborough like to pop the ball around nicely in League One and fair play to them here as they don't look to be deviating too much from this tactic. Lopes in particularly in the middle of the park looks more than comfortable when in possession, which actually matches up to his already sterling reputation from the lower leagues."
13',action,"A cracking start to the match here, and Peterborough are by no means sitting looking to soak up pressure. Indeed, they have another good opportunity inside the opposition penalty area as Maddison curls a searching corner to the near post for Tafazolli to get the header away. In the end it goes a few yards wide, though."
11',action,"SAAAAAVE FROM MCGEE! Chelsea get the corner-kick opportunity down the right wing and it is curled low into the middle of the area by Willian. Terry meets it with a brilliantly-connected right-footed strike, but fortunately for Peterborough it is straight down the throat of the goalkeeper who gets his body in the way to make the stop."
9',action,"Ivanovic has been handed a rare start by Conte this afternoon so will be looking to impress as we break into the second half of the season. Not the best start for him so far though, as on this occasion he suffers a very nasty fall to the floor after an altercation with Hughes on the right wing. He'll be okay to continue, though."
7',action,"GREAT CHANCE FOR THE POSH! Maddison pops up down the right-hand side now and cuts inside on his left foot before whipping an absolutely outstanding cross into the centre of the area. Angol meets it, but not with a particularly good connection which allows Begovic to make the vital save! What an opportunity that was for the visitors."
5',action,"Chelsea have Peterborough camped inside their own penalty area at the moment, with the visitors sitting with basically every man behind the ball. They are given a bit of respite with a goal-kick, though, after Zouma fires a poor attempt into row Z from long range. The Frenchman has been out for a long time with injury, so we can forgive him for that one!"
3',action,"As probably predicted, Chelsea have made a quick start to proceedings here and are looking to take the game to Peterborough in the early stages. Even though Conte has made a raft of changes, they still have a couple of World Cup winners and a 30-million-pound striker among their ranks! Not bad."

,action,TEAM NEWS...
,action,"Chelsea have lost just one out of their last 35 matches against lower-league opposition in the FA Cup at Stamford Bridge. However, the wounds from that one loss are definitely still fresh as it was only two seasons ago they went down 4-2 at home to Bradford, then of League One."
,action,"Back in 1965, Peterborough may indeed have lost to Chelsea in the Sixth Round, but that season was actually the last campaign in which they managed to overcome a top-flight side in the FA Cup. Two rounds previously they successfully defeated Arsenal, but they would then go on to lose 19 subsequent ties against First Division/Premier League teams thereafter."
,action,"However, today's match has the opportunity to provide the biggest shock of all as Peterborough attempt to topple the might of Antonio Conte's Chelsea, who are currently riding high at the top of the Premier League. In the Posh's previous two clashes against Chelsea in the FA Cup, in 1965 and 2001 respectively, they twice shipped five goals as the Blues eased through to the next round. The potential for a similar result today will come as a source of worry for Grant McCann."
,action,"This weekend, we have already seen the 'magic' of the FA Cup become prominent in some of the Third Round fixtures as it has certainly not been a good day or so for Premier League outfits. Stoke, West Brom, and Bournemouth were all the victims of 'giant killings' to sides from a lower division, while Crystal Palace and Southampton were forced into replays which will need to be shoe-horned into the calendar. Not ideal!"
,action,Good afternoon football fans! Welcome to LIVE coverage of the FA Cup Third Round encounter between Chelsea and Peterborough United from Stamford Bridge.
