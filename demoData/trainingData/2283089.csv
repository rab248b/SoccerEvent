,action,"FULL-TIME! Barcelona cruise to a 4-0 win over Eibar, but the scoreline doesn't tell the whole story. Goals from Denis, Messi, Suarez and Neymar wrapped up the three points, but the hosts were competitive for long periods. Enrique's men keep the pressure on the two teams above them, and close out a great result on a tough ground. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+1',assist,"Assist Aleix Vidal Parreu. Vidal is found by Messi on the right-hand side, and curls in a good delivery."
90'+1',goal,"Goal Neymar da Silva Santos Junior. GOOOOOOOOOAL! NEYMAR MAKES IT FOUR! The Brazilian is picked out in acres of space on the left-hand side, and has plenty of time to steer a low finish into the bottom corner. Yoel had no chance."
90'+1',action,There are three minutes of stoppage time in the second half.
90',action,"Over the top from Escalante! The Argentine midfielder is picked out on the right-hand side and thunders a shot off-target, claiming a deflection. The referee points for a goal-kick, however."
88',action,"Neymar is denied well! The former Santos forward controls a cross brilliantly, as Vidal does well down the right, but the Brazilian falls while trying to squeeze home a close-range finish. It really hasn't been his night."
87',action,"Turan slips a pass into Messi, but a poor first touch from the Barcelona star is pounced upon. Eibar try to counter down the right-hand side, but Enrich is denied. Pedro Leon tries to curl a delivery towards the back post, but nobody is there to turn it home, allowing for Aleix Vidal to take the ball down."
85',action,"Pedro Leon is released down the right-hand side and takes aim from around 30 yards out, but the former Getafe winger crashes a shot at goal! Ter Stegen had to get up very well to claw the ball away from the danger area."
84',action,"Barcelona are happy to take their time when playing out from the back, as they are in no rush to concede late and give Eibar some belief. Mathieu almost gives possession away, but the Frenchman is just about able to find the feet of Rakitic."
82',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Antonio Manuel Luna Rodríguez sub-in Christian Rivera Hernández . Luna takes his leave, after picking up an injury, with Rivera given some late minutes. Pena may revert to left-back."
81',action,"Pedro Leon and Capa combine down the right-hand side, before the former finds Pena out on the left flank instead. The substitute tries to drill in a cross towards Enrich, but he is shown away from goal by Umtiti. The hosts maintain their pressure, with Dos Santos flicking a header into Enrich's path, but the Eibar striker's half-volley is blocked well by Mathieu."
80',action,"Eibar are still trying to be positive and work their way upfield, with narrowly over 10 minutes remaining for them to at least find a consolation goal. Barcelona have been counter-attacking with aplomb during this second half, and Ter Stegen has looked assured in between the sticks."
78',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Takashi Inui sub-in Rubén Peña Jiménez . Inui jogs off, with Ruben Pena adding some fresh legs out wide for the last 10 minutes or so."
78',action,"Eibar win themselves a corner on the right-hand side, which is guided into the penalty area immediately.

74',action,"OFFSIDE! Neymar gets played in behind by Messi, and is well onside, but the linesman raises his flag. He dances around Yoel and has the open goal at his mercy, but the play is pulled back. Awful decision."
73',action,"Messi clips a beautiful ball over the top for Suarez, with the Uruguay international attempting to cut back an unselfish square pass. Dos Santos, however, slides in to intervene, with the intervention looping over the crossbar. Moments later, a cross flies in from the right, but Suarez is beaten to it by Capa."
72',action,"Enrich holds the ball up well, with Eibar then opening play out to the right-hand side. Barcelona are happy to hold their shape and stay relatively compact. Whenever possession, turns over, however, the visiting front three burst forward without a second thought."
70',action,"Enrique might want to look at rotating his options after that strike. Lejeune tries to shoot from around 35 yards out, after spotting Ter Stegen off his line, but the central defender lashes an awful effort a long way wide of the target. Clearly, he wants to make up for his mistake!"
68',goal,"Goal Luis Alberto Suárez Díaz. GOOOOOOAL! SUAREZ WRAPS IT UP! The Uruguay international gets into the penalty area, after a poor mistake from Lejeune. He sprints forward and slots a neat finish home at the near post, after stealing possession, and that should be that!"

64',action,"Turan manages to feed Neymar down the left-hand side, but a cut-back from the Brazilian is mopped up by Escalante. Adrian opens play out to Inui, who drives to the byline, but the Japanese winger doesn't get a corner. The ball appeared to come off Sergi Roberto, there."
62',action,"Eibar get their foot on the ball and open play out to the right, with Mendilibar's men not prepared to rush given that Barcelona had a lot of players behind the ball. Enrique is happy to let his side absorb pressure, and Ter Stegen has been great with his feet tonight."
60',action,"Only half an hour remains, but Barcelona don't look ready to surrender what is a healthy lead. Pedro Leon is fed down the right-hand side, with the winger curling in a good cross which is half-cleared by Umtiti. The rebound falls out to Adrian, who shoots straight down the goalkeeper's throat."
58',action,"Neither goalkeeper has had a great deal to do in this second half, except for Yoel picking the ball out of his own net. Denis leads a break for the visitors, with Messi and Sergi Roberto linking up well down the right. Neymar is fed possession, but Dani Garcia does well to win the ball back for the hosts."
56',action,"Eibar are insisting on pushing three players onto Barcelona's back four, making it tough for Ter Stegen to do anything but kick long. The hosts open play out to the left-hand side, before trying to switch to the adventurous Capa, but Neymar tracks back to frustrate the full-back."
54',action,"The hosts are continuing to feel hard done by, but they have little option but to keep creating their half-chances. Pedro Leon tries to get down the right and cross, but Mathieu covers across to put the ball into touch. Despite being two goals behind, Eibar are still pushing on."

Messi drives forward for Barcelona, before playing a beautiful one-two with Suarez, allowing for the Argentine star to slot home a first-touch finish from close range."
48',action,"Inui whips a cross in from the left-hand side, but Eibar fail to make the most of three successive corners. Capa races down the right and tries to slot a pass into Adrian, but Alba fills in for Mathieu and makes a timely interception."
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half at Ipurua! Eibar are a goal behind, but their performance definitely have provided some positives. Barcelona have gradually improved, but Enrich has had some chances."
,action,"HALF-TIME! Barcelona go into the break with a one-goal lead given to them by Denis. It was a wonderful strike, and Messi has started to hit his stride since the half-hour mark, but the away side need another goal to feel truly comfortable. Eibar have been competitive throughout."

44',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Sergio Enrich Ametller. Enrich gets a yellow card now too, despite protesting to the linesman that he got the ball. The Spanish striker took all of it, and nothing of the man. Terrible decision."
43',action,"Messi slides a beautiful pass into Neymar, who skips onto his right foot, but the Brazil international can only shoot into Yoel's legs. That really should have been 2-0, but the goalkeeper made himself very big."
42',yellow-card,Yellow Card Arda Turan. Turan gets a booking for a slightly rash tackle in the middle of the park.
41',action,"Only five minutes remain until the break, with Eibar still trying to maintain their high tempo and pressing as they search for an equaliser. Inui is fed down the left, and threatens to get into the box, but the Japan international is caught narrowly offside."
39',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ander Capa Rodríguez. Capa throws the ball into the advertising hoardings in frustration, earning himself a yellow card for petulance. Eibar's players are clearly of the impression that the referee is letting them down tonight."
38',action,"Messi scampers down the right and cuts infield, before beating Luna all ends up. The Eibar left-back smacks the loose ball in frustration. Barcelona earn themselves a corner as a result, but it is immediately cleared. The Argentine star is starting to find little pockets of space to exploit."
37',action,"Good defending from Umtiti! Adrian manages to swing in a cross from the right-hand side, which sails straight over Mathieu. With Enrich threatening to get hold of the ball at the back post, the French defender does well to recover and concede a corner. The resulting set-piece is taken by Pedro Leon, but Ter Stegen catches it simply."
35',action,"Capa tries to whip in a cross from deep on the right-hand side, but Ter Stegen claims it at his near post.

28',action,"Barcelona respond with a long spell of possession, but Suarez is looking quite isolated up top. Messi is dropping deep in an attempt to link everything together, but Denis hasn't managed to make an impact since coming on. Suarez tries to find Neymar running in behind, but Yoel is off his line quickly to gobble up the loose ball."
26',action,"Umtiti is forced to dive into a desperate sliding challenge, with Ter Stegen once again the goalkeeper to be tested. Adrian takes aim from the edge of the box, and the German shot-stopper gets down smartly. Enrich has been making quite the nuisance of himself. Capa bursts down the right, before feeding a short pass into Pedro Leon, but the ex-Getafe winger shoots straight at the goalkeeper."
26',yellow-card,Yellow Card Gonzalo Escalante. Escalante gets a yellow card for clutching at Neymar's shirt cynically.
24',action,"Eibar stretch the play, with their full-backs pushing right on, with Barcelona struggling to exert as much control on the contest without Busquets. Messi and Neymar have gone on some exciting runs, but otherwise Enrique's men have struggled to flex their offensive muscles."
22',action,"The home side continue to have their fair share of possession, with Luna cutting inside dangerously. The left-back gallivants towards the box, but isn't afforded the chance to shoot. Moments later, Enrich feeds Escalante, but the central midfielder's tame effort is straight at Ter Stegen."

17',action,"Luna is found out on the left-hand side, with Eibar trying to make some progress down that flank.

Moments later, Inui bends in a cross, but Umtiti makes a timely block."
15',action,"Messi lifts a lovely ball over to the left-hand side, with Turan trying to angle a header in towards Suarez. However, under pressure from Capa, the Turkish forward can only pick out Yoel. The visitors have settled down quite nicely after Busquets' injury."
14',action,"Umtiti gives the ball away on the edge of his own penalty area, but the Frenchman is bailed out well by a brilliant sliding tackle from Rakitic. The Croatia international is battling well in Busquets' pivot position. Barcelona are stroking the ball around well, but chances are proving to be few and far between."
12',action,"Suarez tries to shoot from well inside his own half, spotting Yoel off his line, but the shot from the Uruguay international is nowhere near powerful enough. The hosts respond with an attack down the right, but Adrian's curling delivery is grabbed with ease by Ter Stegen."
10',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Sergio Busquets i Burgos sub-in Denis Suárez Fernández . Denis is introduced into the midfield three, and Busquets looks to be very seriously injured. Messi takes the resulting free-kick, but curls the ball over the crossbar."

Yoel tells the Brazil international to get up, in no uncertain terms. Barcelona go on the attack again, with Messi trying to pick out Suarez at the back post, but Dos Santos heads clear."
6',action,"Neymar uses some nice footwork to beat two players, before feeding a pass into the path of the overlapping Alba, but the throughball is slightly too heavy and runs behind for a goal-kick. It has been a fairly open contest thus far, with Eibar happy to press high and risk the visitors getting in behind."
4',action,"Pedro Leon whips a free-kick into the penalty box, which is flicked behind to safety by Mathieu. The hosts deliver the resulting corner, but again the former Valencia defender is there to half-clear. The rebound falls to Capa, who shoots straight at Ter Stegen."
2',action,"The home side are pushing on and trying to harry their opponents, with Pedro Leon then whipping a cross in from the right-hand side. Inui, however, is beaten to the ball at the back post by Sergi Roberto. Mendilibar has clearly sent his players out to get in Barcelona's faces."
