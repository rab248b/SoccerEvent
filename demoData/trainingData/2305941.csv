,action,"That's all from me today, I hope you enjoyed the game as much as I did. Hope to see you next time!"
,action,"Inter Milan continue their excellent run of form in Serie A as they clinch a late victory over Udinese thanks to an Ivan Perisic brace. The hosts had the better of the first half, and were given a deserved lead by Jantko on 18 minutes. Perisic drew Inter level shortly before half-time, and the second period would see Pioli's men take more control of the game. Perisic sealed the deal for the visitors with a late headed winner leaving the final score at 2-1."
,action,FULL TIME: UDINESE 1-2 INTER MILAN
90'+4',action,"BIG APPEAL FOR A PENALTY, BUT THE REFEREE SAYS NO! Danilo goes to ground as he feels a nudge in the back but in truth it would have been a very harsh penalty."
90'+3',action,"The ball drops to Jankto on the edge of the box as Udinese look to salvage a point, but the Czech winger blasts wildly over the bar."
90'+2',action,SAVE! Handanovic is forced to backpeddle and swat the ball away as Hallfredson strikes from distance. That could have been a huge moment for the hosts.
90'+1',substitution,Substitution sub-out Ivan Perišić sub-in Marco Andreolli . Perisic soaks up the applause from Inter's travelling support as he makes way for sub-in Marco Andreolli.
88',assist,"Assist João Mário Naval da Costa Eduardo. Joao Mario has made a significant difference since coming on early in the second half, and it is the Portuguese's free-kick that provides the assist."
87',goal,Goal Ivan Perišić. GOOOAAALLL! IVAN PERISIC HAS SURELY SCORED THE WINNER! The Croatian finished the first half with a late goal and he has done it again in the second. Joao Mario's free-kick is met emphatically by Perisic who wheels away having scored his second goal of the game.
86',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Seko Fofana. Yet another booking, as Frenchman Fofana also picks up a yellow card."
86',yellow-card,Yellow Card Marcelo Brozović. Brozovic trips Matos clumsily and goes into the book. That rules him out of Inter's next fixture against Chievo.
83',substitution,Substitution sub-out Geoffrey Kondogbia sub-in Eder Citadin Martins . A very attacking change from Pioli here who sacrifices the deep lying Kondogbia for the  attack minded Eder.
82',action,"OFF THE LINE! INTER DENIED! Again the chance is created by Candreva, whose cross causes Karnezis all sorts of problems. The Udinese keeper is only capable of tipping the cross into the path of Joao Mario who looks certain to score. But to the home team's rescue comes Widmer who throws himself in front of the ball and keeps the scores level."
80',substitution,Substitution sub-out Cyril Théréau sub-in Ryder Matos Santos . Thereau's race is run as he is replaced by Ryder Matos as Udinese go in search of a late winner. That's their final substitution.
78',action,Inter skipper Icardi is back on defensive duty and heads away well to nullify the danger.
77',action,"Another chance from a set piece, this time for Udinese with Jankto looking to whip the ball in from the left."
75',yellow-card,Yellow Card Jakub Jankto. Jankto picks up a yellow card after he catches Candreva late.
74',yellow-card,Yellow Card Cyril Théréau. Thereau is furious at Murillo's reaction to his challenge and goes into the book for his aggressive pursuit of the Colombian.
74',action,"Jankto again provides the attacking impetus for the home team, flying down the right wing before delivering his cross. Murillo cuts it out and wins the free-kick as he is caught by Thereau."
72',substitution,Substitution sub-out Rodrigo Javier de Paul sub-in Stipe Perica . De Paul is replaced by Croatian youngster Perica.
70',action,"Perisic strikes well, but the ball flies narrowly wide of Karnezis' post keeping the score at 1-1."
69',action,FREE-KICK IN A DANGEROUS POSITION - A foul on the edge of the box leaves Inter with a golden opportunity to take the lead.
68',action,"The game has been played at breakneck speed, but the pace has slowed slightly in the last five minutes. A wayward Ansaldi cross provides Karnezis with an easy catch."
65',yellow-card,Yellow Card Geoffrey Kondogbia. Kondogbia picks up the first booking of the match with a painful looking stamp on the toes of Zapata.
63',substitution,Substitution sub-out Sven Kums sub-in Emil Hallfreðsson . Udinese's first change sees a like for like replacement as Hallfredsson replaces Kums in central midfield.
62',action,Inter are growing into the game now with substitute Joao Mario seeing a lot of the ball. You get the feeling that Udinese may have missed one chance too many.
60',action,"CHANCE - D'Ambrosio gets a free run and meets Candreva's corner with great force but little guile, as the ball flies over the bar."
57',action,CLOSE - Another wonderful cross from Candreva who is causing the Udinese defence all sorts of problems. Perisic was ghosting in at the far post and Widmer is forced to turn the ball behind for a corner.
56',substitution,Substitution sub-out Éver Maximiliano David Banega sub-in João Mário Naval da Costa Eduardo . Banega was picked ahead of Joao Mario today but failed to justify Pioli's decision. The Argentine has been ineffective and spurned one of the biggest chances of the game.
54',action,"ANOTHER CHANCE FOR THE HOME TEAM - Udinese really pushing for a second goal here. Jankto is again the orchestrator as he runs from midfield before sliding the ball through to Zapata. The Colombian is always being forced wide by Miranda, and his strike can only find the side netting."
51',action,"Udinese surge forward again, sensing that Inter are weak. Jankto finds space on the edge of the box and he floats the ball towards the back stick but is unable to pick out either De Paul or the back of the net."
50',action,CHANCE! UDINESE THIS TIME - Thereau's corner reaches the far post where both Zapata and Danilo are waiting. The two Udinese men get in each other's way and bundle the ball wide.
49',action,CHANCE!!! EVER BANEGA MISSES A HUGE OPPORTUNITY! A devilish cross from Candreva beats all the Udinese defenders and finds the Argentine unmarked at the back post. Banega snatches at the chance though and fails to convert a very easy chance.
47',action,Inter win their fifth corner of the match after Icardi's strike was tipped wide by Karnezis. The cross is long and looping and easily dealt with by the home team.
45',action,Here we go again! Inter kick-off and the match re-starts.
,action,The two teams are heading back out onto the pitch and we will be back underway soon.
,action,"HALF TIME - UDINESE 1-1 Inter: The home side have dominated the opening 45 minutes and could easily have led by two or three goals, but Inter's resilience has allowed them to stay in the game. Following Jankto's opener on 18 minutes Zebrette spurned a handful of chances, only to see their lead canceled out by a Perisic equaliser on the stroke of half-time."
45'+3',assist,"Assist Mauro Emanuel Icardi Rivero. Icardi has been quiet this half, but he did well there to drift wide and pick out Perisic in space."
45'+2',goal,"Goal Ivan Perišić. GOOOOAAALLL! INTER HAVE SCORED AGAINST THE RUN OF PLAY - Right on the stroke of half-time Ivan Perisic has drawn Inter level. The Croatian found space in the box and slotted home coolly, though Karnezis may have done more to keep that one out at his near post."
44',action,"ANOTHER CHANCE FOR UDINESE! This time it falls to the fullback Widmer, as a driven corner drops to him in acres of space. The Swiss defender is unable to react quick enough though and entirely miscues his half-volley"
43',action,"FINE SAVE FROM HANDANOVIC! The Inter goalkeeper had to have his wits about him there, as he adjusted well to make an acrobatic save from De Paul's deflected cross."
41',action,A free-kick in a dangerous position for the Zebrette sees Jankto whip in a testing cross. Inter fail to clear at the first attempt but eventually smuggle the ball away.
39',action,"This game has been end-to-end all half and it is a miracle that we have not seen more goals. You couldn't say that either side was in control, but both have played some scintillating stuff."
36',action,"A looping Candreva cross forces a save from a backpeddling Karnezis, who concedes a corner."
34',action,ANOTHER GOAL RULED OUT! This time it is for Inter as Perisic meets a Candreva cross to provide a tidy first time finish. The Croatian's celebrations are cut short however as the linesman has his flag up for offside. A tight but correct call.
31',action,"Udinese have the ball in the back of the net again, but it won't stand after Thereau catches Miranda and concedes a free-kick."
28',action,"A strong challenge by Murillo stops Thereau in his tracks, and the Colombian defender is quick to launch a counter-attack. Once again however the move breaks down as Icardi is caught off-side."
26',action,Perisic picks the ball up once again on the left wing and drives towards the Udinese goal. He is guarded expertly by Samir and his tame strike can only find the side netting.
24',action,Inter flood forward in search of a response to the Udinese onslaught. There are some muted penalty claims as Widmer catches Perisic but the ref waves them away.
22',action,"CHANCE! UDINESE AGAIN! Jankto could have doubled his lead there, drove forward and the Inter defence parted like the red sea. His shot flashes narrowly wide."
20',action,OFF THE POST! Another chance for the home side as they come very close to doubling their lead. Zapata does well to find space and whip in his cross which picks out De Paul. The winger connects well but sees his strike cannon back off the post.
18',assist,Assist Samir Caetano de Souza Santos. Samir made that goal with a quite brilliant run from deep. The Brazillian provided a perfectly weighted pass and Jankto did the rest.
17',goal,Goal Jakub Jankto. GOOOOOAAALLL!!! WONDERFUL GOAL FROM JAKUB JANKTO! The move comes from deep as Samir carries the ball out of defence committing several Inter defenders. He then slips the ball through to Jankto who makes no mistake providing an emphatic finish to put Udinese 1-0 up.
15',action,"Neither side has really taken charge in the early exchanges, but draws are a rarity in this fixture. The two teams have not enjoyed a share of the spoils since a goalless draw back in January 2008."
12',action,A free-kick is awarded to Udinese after Ivan Perisic catches Sylvain Widmer late.
10',action,"Ever Banega is pulling the strings for Inter at the moment, the Argentine taking charge with Joao Mario left on the bench for today's clash."
8',action,CHANCE - The ball finds its way to the edge of the Udinese box following an inter corner and Antonio Candreva pounces to strike the ball goalwards. It's a comfortable save for Karnezis in the end but a sign of intent from the visitors.
7',action,"Mauro Icardi looks to be in on goal, but just as he bears down on the Udinese goal the linesman raises his flag for offside."
6',action,CLOSE!!! Fofana with a brilliant strike from distance which draws the best out of Handanovic between the sticks for Inter. The big Slovenian had to stretch every inch of his considerable frame to get fingertips on the Frenchman's stinging shot which he manages to tip over the bar.
4',action,"A brief break in play as Kondogbia recovers from a clattering challenge in the centre-circle. The fans are in fine voice at the Dacia Arena, clearly enjoying having Serie A football back underway."
2',action,CHANCE - Udinese old boy Handanovic miskicks and gifts the ball back to the Zebrette. Jankto gets a sight of goal but drags his shot wide.
1',action,"And we're off, Inter make a positive start as they drive forward through Brozovic. The croatian is closed down quickly by the Udinese defenders."
,action,Both teams are out on the pitch and kick-off is just moments away...

,action,"The teams are in so let’s take a look at how both sides will line up, starting with the hosts…"
,action,"Udinese meanwhile sit firmly in mid-table but have benefitted from the recent form of forward Cyril Thereau. The Frenchman has made vital contributions to both the goals and assists columns in recent weeks, and could be the key to unlocking Inter’s defence."
,action,"Since the dismissal of Frank de Boer, Inter have adapted well to the style of new boss Stefano Pioli, and have surged up the league into seventh place after a dismal start to the season."
,action,"Neither of these teams would have welcomed the recent interruption to the fixture list, as both had hit a rich vein of form prior to the winter interlude. Inter have been unstoppable of late, winning six of their last seven games; while Udinese collected 10 from a possible 12 points in December."
,action,"Hello, and welcome to coverage of today’s clash between Udinese and Inter Milan at the Dacia Arena, as Serie A makes its return following the winter break."
