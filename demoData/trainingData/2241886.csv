80',action,"ANOTHER SAINTS CHANCE! Steklenburg pulls off a great save to deny Ward-Prowse from close range after another ball into the box by Cedric, and then Jagielka needs to clear the rebound off the line to prevent a second Southampton goal. The Everton is just about keeping his side in the game."
79',substitution,Substitution sub-out Nathan Redmond sub-in Jordy Clasie . Saints make their first substitution of the game with Redmond coming off and sub-in Jordy Clasie replaces him.
78',yellow-card,Yellow Card Romelu Lukaku Menama. Yellow card Romelu Lukaku Menama
77',action,"Now it is Southampton's turn to attack! Once again it is Sims who breaks down the right, he beats Baines and shoots at goal but it is blocked and Austin can't reach the rebound. Just seconds later Austin finds Ward-Prowse in a good position on the six-yard box after capitalising on a spill by the Everton goalkeeper, but Ward-Prowse puts his effort wide."
76',action,"CLOSE! Everton are knocking on the door now! Baines swings a dangerous free-kick deep into the box which is almost met by Williams, but Saints just about clear the ball for a corner. The corner into the box is superbly headed away. Danger cleared."
74',action,Everton are certainly pushing more players forward now in an attempt to grab an equalising goal. It is now the visitors who are controlling possession and are threatening the Saints goal as we enter the final 15 minutes of the game.
73',action,"Redmond tries his luck with a cheeky chip from the edge of the box after the pull back from Bertrand, but he gets it all wrong and it flies high and wide over the Everton net."
71',substitution,Substitution sub-out Ross Barkley sub-in Kevin Mirallas . Another change by Everton as Barkley is replaced by sub-in Kevin Mirallas.
68',action,"Sims does very well to beat three Everton players through his terrific pace down the right but he then appeared to be caught in two minds, he tries to play a ball across to Austin but it is intercepted. Perhaps he would've been better trying his luck with a shot a goal."

65',substitution,Substitution sub-out Aaron Lennon sub-in Gerard Deulofeu Lázaro . Everton make their first substitution of the game with Lennon coming off to be replaced by Gerard Deulofeu.
64',action,"CHANCE EVERTON! Forster pulls off a brilliant save to deny an acrobatic attempt by Bolasie, that would've been a great finish but the linesman has his flag up for offside so it wouldn't have counted anyway."
61',action,"Sims has been outstanding for Southampton today, a great full first-team debut for the 19-year-old, constantly causing Baines problems down the left flank and linking well with Austin."
58',action,CHANCE SAINTS! It's end to end stuff here now at St Mary's. Austin comes incredibly close to doubling his tally for today and Saints lead. Cedric whips a excellent cross into the box from the right and Austin rises above Jagielka and fires a header towards the bottom corner but it is superbly saved by Steklenburg. Fantastic save.
56',action,"CHANCE EVERTON! Lennon finds Bolasie, who shows the defender a clean pair of heels, but his fierce drive goes narrowly wide of Forster's post. Everton are getting closer."

51',action,Not the best start to the second half for Everton who really need to improve if they're to get back into this game. Perhaps a couple of changes are needed as Southampton look comfortable.
49',action,"OFF THE POST! Saints almost double their lead immediately. Hojbjerg smashes a shot against the post from close range after a deep corner fell to him at the far post, he easily beat Bolaise who dived into the tackle and then perhaps should've crossed the ball to the waiting Austin but instead took the shot on himself."
48',action,"Everton haven't made a great start to the second-half, giving the ball away twice within a minute, prompting plenty groans from the away supporters who have made the long journey down to Hampshire."

,action,The teams are back out and the second half is almost ready to get underway.
,action,"The Saints are ahead thanks to Austin's ninth goal of the season in the opening minute of the game, and the hosts have look comfortable since then, causing the Everton defence plenty of problems.

,action,HALF-TIME: SOUTHAMPTON 1-0 EVERTON
45'+1',action,That's the half-time whistle!
45',action,There will be one minute of added time to be played at St Mary's.
44',action,"Everton have a corner right at the end of the first half, it was good play by Lukaku who linked up well with Bolasie who tried to take on Bertrand but the Saints full-back stays strong and puts the ball out for a corner, which comes to nothing."
42',action,"Austin is causing the Everton defenders a lot of problems up top with his strength, and he has just tussled with Ashley Williams on the half-way line after attempting to hold the ball up, the referee awarded the Toffees a free-kick and calms both players down."
39',action,Decent opportunity for Southampton! Cedric puts deep ball into the box towards Hojbjerg but their is slightly too much on it and he can't direct his header towards goal.

33',action,"Yannick Bolasie has won a free-kick down the left for the Toffees in a decent position after a foul by Romeu. Leighton Baines whips the ball deep in the Saints penalty area and it is met by Barry at the far post but he header goes over the bar, without troubling Fraser Forster."
31',action,"STAT: Lukaku is the man that Southampton need to watch, he has scored three and assisted one in four Premier League appearances at St. Mary's, including a brace for the Everton in this fixture last season."

26',action,"CHANCE EVERTON! The first real opportunity to score for the visitors. It was great link-up play between Barry and Coleman, with the latter pulling the ball back to Idrissa Gueye on the penalty spot in plenty of space, but he fires his shot high over the bar. Not the man that Everton would've wanted that ball to fall too."
24',action,"Redmond tries his luck from long-range but he was put under pressure from Coleman and Jagielka, and he sliced his shot well wide of the Everton net."
22',action,"Romelu Lukaku are barely touched the ball so far for the Toffees, which is just an idea of how dominant the Saints have been in the opening period of this game."
20',action,"A lot of Southampton's attacking threat is coming down the left-hand side through Redmond and Ryan Bertrand, the pair are linking up well and causing Seamus Coleman and Aaron Lennon plenty of problems with their pace and trickery."
18',action,"Southampton look like they could score every time that they go forward at the moment, Everton don't look very confident at the back and are struggling to keep a handle on Austin, Redmond and Sims."
17',action,"CHANCE SAINTS! Sims with a great chance to double the hosts lead! Redmond had plenty of space down the left and puts a great ball into the box, which is met by Sims who was in acres of space, but he can't get enough power behind his header to beat Stekelenburg who gathers to his right."
14',action,"Saints free-kick in a good position down the left-hand side after a foul by Phil Jagielka. James Ward-Prowse whips the ball into the box, however Stekelenburg does well to punch the ball clear of the box, but the ball the falls nicely to Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg on the edge of the area but his fierce shot goes well over the bar."
13',action,"Despite Everton seeing more of the ball, Southampton look very comfortable here right now and look far more dangerous going forward, through the pace of Sims and Redmond on the wings."
11',action,"Gareth Barry and Ross Barkley are linking up well in midfield for Everton, they're currently dominating the possession but are still not causing the Saints defence any problems, with Jose Fonte and Virgil van Dijk easily clearing any danger that comes their way at the moment."
9',action,"STAT: Before today's game Southampton had failed to score against Everton on 13 occasions in the Premier League, however Austin's header in the opening minute has made sure we won't see a repeat of that today."
7',action,"This is better from the Toffees they've settled down and are starting to keep possession of the ball in the middle of the park, but Southampton are pressing well and aren't allowing them any time or space in their own half."
5',action,"Everton still look stunned at conceding that early goal, not the start that Ronald Koeman wouldn't wanted on his return to St Mary's."
4',action,"The Saints couldn't of wished for a better start to this game, they look in control at the moment and the home supporters are voices their pleasure at this terrific start."
