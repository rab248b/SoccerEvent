85',action,"Both sides look pretty content with the scoreline at the moment, neither side really threatening to score. Atalanta will be eager for the full-time whistle to blow so they can put this game in the past! It has been a much better second half performance from the visitors but the damage was already done."

74',action,"Atalanta are still trying to push forward when they can but they are lacking any conviction and confidence, so the Inter defence are able to cope with anything they can throw at them. A special day for Inter, as they celebrate their 109-year anniversary."
71',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Jasmin Kurtič. Plenty of Atalanta players on yellow cards now, Jasmin Kurtič is the latest to be warned by the referee."

66',action,"Excellent play by Icardi! He takes the ball down with ease, nicking it away from Bastoni who then makes a rash challenge and brings the Inter skipper down. The hosts now have a free-kick in a very good shooting position. Plenty of players are eager to have a go at this set piece."
64',action,"The Inter crowd is loving this performance from their team, it will move them up to fourth in Serie A on 54 points, jumping above Lazio. However they will remain five points behind Roma on 59 points, who also have a game in hand."

Perisic just has to lift the ball over Zukanovic to Icardi who was in acres of space but the defender got back and made a very good block."
57',action,"Prior to today's game, Atalanta had avoided defeat in three of their last five visits to Inter, plus they beat Inter 2-1 in the reverse fixture back in October."

49',action,"CHANCE! Icardi is played through on goal, he is dragged slightly wide of the goal and takes a shot from the edge of the box.

That was far too easy, the Inter defence taking their eye of the ball for a few seconds and Atalanta grab a goal shortly before half-time. Is a comeback on the cards?"
41',action,Inter are sending out a real warning to their rivals here today with this superb performance. Is there time left in this first-half for them to score another?

24',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Etrit Berisha. Berisha goes into the book for his blatant foul on Icardi, his misery could be compounded if Icardi can convert the spot-kick."
23',action,"PENALTY INTER! Icardi takes the ball down from the flick on by Perisic, he plays the ball past Berisha who slides in and clearly brings Icardi down in the box. The referee had no hesitation in pointing to the spot."

17',goal,"Goal Mauro Emanuel Icardi Rivero. GOOOAAALLL! ICARDI SCORES! The free-kick is straight at the wall by Perisic but it then strikes a few players in the box before falling perfectly to the feet of Icardi, who reacts the quickest and then slots the ball past Berisha into the back of the net with ease. Inter lead one-nil!"
15',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Rafael Tolói. Perhaps a lucky man to still be on the pitch, as the referee deems his trip on Icardi to just be worthy of a yellow card."
15',action,"WHAT A CHANCE! Icardi is through on goal after a lob over the top of the Atalanta defence, the skipper takes a touch and then as he is about to pull the trigger he is tripped up by Rafael Toloi. Inter players are appealing for a red card to be given for Toloi being the last man, but the referee sees it differently. Free-kick to Inter on the edge of the box in an excellent position to open the scoring."
14',action,Atalanta have their first corner of the game. Cristian Ansaldi blocking the cross from Andrea Conti. The set piece is a poor one and Inter clear the danger.
12',action,"Candreva received the ball in acres of space in the middle of the pitch, no Atalanta players within 20 yards of him! He tries to go all the way himself, but he really should've played the ball through to Icardi who was in a much better position and the opportunity to run through on goal with just the keeper to beat. However Candreva tries to do too much and Ervin Zukanovic makes a good tackle."
11',action,"A good open game here at the San Siro so far, both teams look threatening going forward as you would expect from two teams aiming for European qualification."

,action,CONFIRMED TEAM NEWS...
,action,"While the visitors are fifth in Serie A, they proved their class by beating Napoli, which Inter failed to do. Atalanta come in to this on the back of a great season so far, they’ve managed to find the net in their last five on the road. Plus, Inter have conceded in more than half of their home matches, so the visitors will be confident of being able to secure victory at the San Siro today."
,action,"Former Inter manager Gian Piero Gasperini returns with to the San Siro today with Atalanta, the visiting boss was sacked by Inter back in 2011 after just three months in charge. Atalanta’s shock push for the top spots continued with a 2-0 win over Napoli two weeks ago, a victory would be huge for their Europa League push, while a defeat would knock them out of the top five, with Inter overtaking them in the table."
,action,"Inter come in to this game in mixed form, they beat Cagliari 5-1 last time out, however they have recently suffered defeats against Roma, Juventus and Lazio. In their last 14 league games, Stefano Pioli has seen his team record 11 victories, but their defeats against the current top three shows why they are likely to miss out on a Champions League place."
,action,"Two teams aiming for European qualification go head-to-head today at the San Siro as Inter host Atalanta. It is also many happy returns to the home side, who are playing their first game since turning 109-years-old! Plenty of trophies clinched in that time!"
