,action,"Thanks for joining our commentary. Until next time, goodbye."
,action,"Liverpool will be kicking themselves. They dominated the first half and appeared to have stymied Bournemouth's first comeback attempt with Emre Can found the net, but lapse defending and mistakes from Loris Karius have seen them lose the game from a 3-1 winning position in the 64th minute."
,action,"WHAT A GAME! Bournemouth looked dead and buried at 3-1 down midway through the second half,  but the Cherries produced one of the most memorable comebacks in Premier League history to win the match at Dean Court this afternoon. An incredible feat by Eddie Howe's men."
,action,FULL-TIME: BOURNEMOUTH 4-3 LIVERPOOL
90'+5',action,THAT'S IT! BOURNEMOUTH HAVE WON THE MATCH!

90'+3',goal,"Goal Nathan Aké. GOAL!!!!! AKE SCORES AND BOURNEMOUTH LEAD! Incredible scenes at Dean Court as Karius makes a howler, palming Cook's blast from distance into the path of Ake.

90',action,There will be five minutes of added time.

87',yellow-card,Yellow Card Emre Can. Can goes into the book for a high boot on Fraser.
85',action,"The visitors are attempting to find their passing rhythm again and are sending men in the Bournemouth half, although it will leave them open on the counter."
83',action,Liverpool have completely unravelled here. Their composure has gone and are now in a battle to take a point from the contest.
81',action,"OVER! Wilshere collects the Liverpool clearance from the resulting corner and smashes an effort with his left foot, but sends his strike well over the bar."
80',action,"CHANCE! Afobe turns Lovren with ease on the edge of the box and shoots with power, but Karius makes the block with his body to send the ball over the bar."
78',assist,Assist Ryan Fraser. Fraser has made a great impact since coming on and notches an assist to go with his goal and run to win the penalty.
78',goal,"Goal Steve Cook. GOAL!!!! BOURNEMOUTH ARE LEVEL!!! Cook scores a great goal to get his side's equaliser. Wilshere sent Fraser down the right flank and his cross found the defender in the box, who took one touch to control it out of the air and then steered his strike past Karius. Game on!"
76',goal,Goal Ryan Fraser. GOAL!!!! Bournemouth are back in the game again. Fraser latches on to Wilson's cutback after Afobe missed the ball. He takes one touch to get the ball out of his feet before firing the second into the bottom corner. A sublime finish from the midfielder.

75',substitution,Substitution sub-out Dan Gosling sub-in Benik Afobe . Afobe replaces Gosling for the home side.

72',action,Milner does well on the left flank to keep an attack alive and wins a corner off the legs of Fraser. His workrate has been impressive this afternoon.
70',action,"CHANCE! Fraser almost brings the hosts within touching distance again as he latches on to a loose ball on the edge of the box and fires at goal. However, Karius beats his effort over the bar."

68',action,"Arter wastes a good position as he collects the ball from a clearance on the edge of the box, hammering his strike well over the bar."

66',action,"Can gets in down the left flank and sends a low ball across the face of goal, but Francis is there to clear the danger."
64',assist,"Assist Sadio Mané. Mane is fortunate to retain possession on his forward run before he lays the ball off to Can, who finishes in style."
64',goal,Goal Emre Can. GOAL!!!! CAN SCORES A STUNNER! Liverpool restore their two-goal cushion as Can collects Mane's pass on the edge of the box before curling an effort beyond the outstretched hand of Boruc into the top corner. A super finish from the German.
62',action,"SHOT! Firmino sends the ball over to the right flank and Clyne collects before firing at goal. His effort has power, but not the accuracy needed to find the net, sailing well over the bar."
61',action,"Fraser bursts forward through the middle and lays the ball into the path of Wilson. The striker looks for the offload to Wilshere, but the two are not on same page and Liverpool clear the danger."

57',action,Klopp did not look too pleased on the touchline and referee Madley has given him a final warning over his conduct. Any more outbursts and the Liverpool boss will be forced to watch the rest of the match from the stands.

55',substitution,Substitution sub-out Junior Stanislas sub-in Ryan Fraser . Stanislas is helped off the pitch and Fraser replaces him in the Bournemouth midfield.

46',action,We're back underway at Dean Court.
,action,"The players are back out for the second half, so we should be underway shortly."
,action,"Eddie Howe will be concerned about how easy Liverpool's goals were to score, although the deficit could have been halved had they been awarded a penalty when Nathan Ake was brought down by Roberto Firmino, but referee Madley dismissed their claims. The Cherries will have to improve in the second half to get a positive result out of this one."
,action,"Liverpool hold a comfortable 2-0 lead at the break over Bournemouth thanks to goals from Sadio Mane and Divock Origi. The Reds dominated the opening 30 minutes with the home side struggling to get a touch of the ball.

39',action,"Liverpool waste another free-kick in a decent position as this time Can latches on to a low pass, but his cross fails the beat the first man."

32',action,The Cherries cannot get anywhere near Liverpool to disrupt their passing game. It has been a very tentative performance from Howe's men thus far.
30',action,"A rare misplaced ball from Henderson as he surges down the right. The Liverpool skipper sends his cross straight into the hands of Boruc, failing to hit any of his team-mates in the box."

22',assist,Assist Jordan Henderson. Henderson spots Origi in space before the striker does the rest with the finish.
22',goal,"Goal Divock Okoth Origi. GOAL!!!! Origi finishes brilliantly on the break to double Liverpool's lead. Henderson sends a simple ball over the top and the striker is through on goal.

The Brazilian volleys at goal, but Cook makes a good block to stop his strike from testing Boruc."

12',action,Liverpool are dominating possession to start to the contest and have put the home side well and truly on the back foot.
10',action,"CHANCE! Liverpool should be ahead, but Origi slips at the back post and fails to convert a simple opportunity. Henderson and Clyne carved out the opening with the visitors' skipper playing a nice ball down the flank for the full-back, who in turn put a delightful cross to the back post, but the striker failed to score."
8',action,"The Reds put the squeeze on Bournemouth in their own half and pile men forward. Mane attempts to weave his way through the middle, but he gets crowded out and denied a free-kick on the edge of the box."

,action,"Liverpool are forced into two changes from the side that beat Sunderland last week. Coutinho as previously mentioned is out with an ankle injury, leaving Origi to replace him at the apex of the attack, sending Roberto Firmino on to the flank of the three-man forward line. Joel Matip also has an ankle problem, forcing Klopp to start Lucas Leiva in the heart of the defence alongside Dejan Lovren."
,action,"Howe has made two changes to his side from their 3-1 defeat to Arsenal last week. Artur Boruc is fit again and retakes his place from Adam Federici between the sticks, while Jack Wilshere was ineligible to play against his parent club last week, but returns to the fold to replace Brad Smith in the midfield."
,action,"Liverpool subs: Mignolet, Moreno, Lallana, Klavan, Alexander-Arnold, Ejaria, Woodburn."

,action,"Jurgen Klopp will be desperate for another three points this afternoon to keep pace with Chelsea at the top, although they will have to do so without Philippe Coutinho, who could be out for an extended period with an ankle injury."
,action,"The Reds scoring form in front of the net was looking in peril for the second week on the spin against Sunderland after being previously shut out against Southampton. However, Divock Origi spared their blushes at Anfield curling an effort into the net before James Milner secured the points with a late penalty."
,action,"Eddie Howe's men have been in inconsistent form of late and are in need of a positive result to avoid getting dragged into the battle at the bottom of the table. Since their 6-1 triumph over Hull in mid-October they've won only once and have suffered defeats to Middlesbrough, Arsenal and Sunderland last time out at home."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to the live commentary of the Premier League clash between Bournemouth and Liverpool at Dean Court.
