,action,"Well, that’s all from me for now. Until next time, thank you and goodbye!"
,action,"There’s plenty of positives for Hull to take from today, though, as they continue their scrap to avoid relegation. Arsenal, meanwhile, rise up to third, moving level on points with Tottenham, who face Liverpool later."
,action,"Sanchez was superb throughout, and has dragged Arsenal through an attritional contest. Hull had their chances, and can rightly feel aggrieved for some harsh refereeing decisions, but in the end it is the hosts who come out on top."
,action,"FULL TIME! It’s all over at the Emirates, where Alexis Sanchez’s double has put Arsenal back on track with a 2-0 victory!"
90'+4',action,"That strike takes Sanchez onto 17 Premier League goals, making him the top-flights top-scorer - for the time being."
90'+3',penalty-goal,"Penalty Goal Alexis Alejandro Sánchez Sánchez. GOOOAAAAALLL! It was fantastic work from Sanchez to create the chance, and he duly finishes it off from the spot, thumping in a low strike past the despairing dive of Jakupovic."
90'+1',red-card,"Red Card Sam Clucas. PENALTY TO ARSENAL! Well, Hull have every right to feel hard-done by. They went behind to a hand-ball from Sanchez, and were Gibbs escaped what really should have been a red card for a foul on Markovic. And now, Clucas has received his marching orders for preventing Perez’s header finding the net."
88',action,"Perez does well for Arsenal down the right, finding space before combing with Elneny and delivering a precise cross towards the head of Sanchez, but Jakupovic races off his line to punch it clear."
86',action,"CHANCE! Evandro’s corner is a superb one, and Diomande meets it. He is unmarked and unchallenged, but can only head over from six-yards out."
83',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain sub-in Lucas Pérez Martínez . Secondly, Lucas Perez replaces sub-out Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, as Arsenal look to add some potency to a rather lacklustre forward line, with Hull having stepped up the pressure heading into the closing stages."
82',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Alex Iwobi sub-in Daniel Nii Tackie Mensah Welbeck . Two quick-fire changes for the hosts, and both are positive. First, Danny Welbeck comes on in place of sub-out Alex Iwobi."
80',action,"CLOSE! Hull catch Arsenal out with a short corner, from which Elmohamedy then whips in an inviting cross to the near post. Niasse connects, but cannot direct his header towards goal."
78',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Tom Huddlestone sub-in Adama Valentin Diomande . A third and final change for Hull. sub-out Tom Huddlestone’s race is run, and he makes way for Adama Diomande, in an attacking substation from Silva."
76',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Alexis Alejandro Sánchez Sánchez. A big call from the referee, but Mark Clattenburg appears to have got it right. Sanchez had squared-up Ranocchia, and seemingly went down after been clipped by the Italian, though the official - correctly so - deemed it to be simulation, and worthy of a booking."
73',action,"It has to be said, that though Hull have not threatened in the last 10 minutes or so, Arsenal’s performance since the interval has been far from convincing. The atmosphere is muted, and the display of the players is reflecting that. They appear nervous and, if they cannot snatch a second goal, could well find themselves hanging on in the closing stages..."
70',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Andrea Ranocchia. The game has turned into a slightly scrappy affair now, and that is summarised by a reckless challenge from Ranocchia, who rightly goes into the book for lunge on Sanchez."
69',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Theo Walcott sub-in Mohamed Naser Elsayed Elneny . A maiden change of the game now from Wenger. sub-out Theo Walcott’s wait for his 100th Arsenal goal goes on, as he is replaced by Mohamed Elneny."
66',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Omar Elabdellaoui sub-in Ahmed Eissa El Mohamady Abdel Fattah . Another substitution from Marco Silva. sub-out Omar Elabdellaoui makes way, with Ahmed El Mohamady - having returned from the Africa Cup of Nations - his replacement."
64',action,"Again, Markovic proves to be Hull’s danger man, as he once more gets the better of Gibbs and delivers a low cross towards Niasse, but Koscielny is well-placed to intercept."
62',action,"Good anticipation from Robertson, as he cuts-out Sanchez’s pass. Moments later, though, the Scotland full-back is caught out, though Walcott’s attempted finish is a poor one."
60',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Kamil Grosicki sub-in Evandro Goebel . A first change of the game now, and it is Hull who blink first. sub-out Kamil Grosicki is going off, with Evandro - who had started the last three Premier League games - coming on."
59',action,"Clever play from Ozil, who sets-up Iwobi on the edge of Hull’s area with a subtle flick, but the Arsenal youngster cannot direct his following strike on target."
57',action,"Tempers are just starting to fray now, and Arsenal are yet to stamp any authority on proceedings since the restart, with Hull starting to pose a threat going forward."
54',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Kieran Gibbs. A real let-off for Arsenal and Gibbs, who could easily have been sent off for a clear foul on Markovic, who was through on goal. There was no other player between the Serbian and Cech, bar Gibbs, and Mark Clattenburg has been extremely lenient."
53',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Theo Walcott. An unnecessary booking now for Walcott, who receives a caution for throwing the ball away after a tussle with Maguire."
52',action,"GREAT SAVE! A brilliant run from Markovic sets Hull away on the counter. The winger gets away from Gibbs and prods in a cross, which Niasse takes down on his chest before thumping a strike goalwards, but Cech reacted sharply to tip the ball wide."
50',action,"That injury to Coquelin has led to a rather stuttering start to proceedings in this half, though the Frenchman is back on the pitch now and seems to be moving freely enough."
48',action,"Well, Elneny - fresh from netting for Egypt in their defeat in the Africa Cup of Nations final on Sunday - had been warming up extensively at half-time, and he may well be called into action should Coquelin fail to recover..."
46',action,"We’re back underway at the Emirates, and an early concern for Arsenal, as Coquelin stays down following a collision with Huddlestone."
,action,"There’s still lots of work to do for the hosts though if they are to ensure a return to winning ways, with Marco Silva sure to be rallying his troops to push for at least a draw heading into the second-half."
,action,"Despite creating a few early chances, Hull have lacked quality in attack, and their stubborn defence was finally punctured by the superb Sanchez, albeit in controversial fashion, with the Chilean clearly having handled the ball into the net - though not deliberately."
,action,"Coming into this clash on the back of two damaging defeats to Watford and Chelsea respectively, it hasn’t been the most convincing of displays from Arsenal so far, though they are deserving of the lead."
,action,"HALF-TIME. That’s it for the opening 45 minutes at the Emirates, where Alexis Sanchez’s goal has put Arsenal ahead against Hull."
45'+1',action,"Good work from Niasse who, after initially allowing Gibbs to get back and make a tackle, recovers possession and wins a free-kick down the right. Clucas delivers, but Arsenal clear with relative ease."
44',action,"Just to back up that previous post, Hull have failed to score in 11 of their 24 league games this season - more often than any other Premier League side. They have, however, managed to win a corner on the left, though a mix-up between Clucas and Grosicki ensures that it comes to nothing."
41',action,"Hull need to settle now, or risk going further behind before the interval. They are working the ball forward well, but just seem to lack the guile and craft required in the final third at the moment, despite their spirited display."
39',action,"Handy work… Alexis Sanchez has had a hand in seven goals in four Premier League appearances against Hull City (six goals, one assist)."
37',action,"Though the handball was not deliberate, Sanchez’s arm was raised above his body, and the officials should have spotted that. However, they didn’t, and the hosts - deservedly - have the lead."
34',goal,"Goal Alexis Alejandro Sánchez Sánchez. GOOOOOOAAAALLL!!! Sanchez smothers Arsenal ahead! Well, heartbreak for Hull! The goal has been coming, but it really should not have counted. Robertson got back to clear a strike off the line, but the Chilean was on hand to latch onto the loose ball. Jakupovic managed to make a half-save, parrying the ball up into the arm of Sanchez, and the ball trickled over the line."
33',action,"RISKY! Moments after Walcott’s effort is charged down by Clucas, Maguire very-nearly puts Arsenal ahead. The Hull defender never seemed to lose his cool as he headed into the hands of his goalkeeper from close-range, though had Jakupovic not reacted sharply, it would have been a calamitous own-goal."
32',action,"Hull are defending well, with all-but Niasse getting back behind the ball when the need arises. They do look a threat on the counter, though on a few occasions, sloppiness in possession has allowed Arsenal to break them down."
31',action,MATCH STAT - Seven of Sanchez's 21 touches so far this game have come in the Hull penalty area.
29',action,"A fine save from Jakupovic to deny Sanchez, though the Chilean’s headed effort would not have counted as the offside flag had already been raised."
27',action,"Slack play from Ranocchia on this occasion, as he allows Sanchez to nip-in and steal possession, but fortunately for the Inter-loanee, the hosts cannot make anything of it."
26',action,"MISS! Sublime work from Sanchez, who stands up a wonderful delivery into the centre of the area. Ozil rushes to meet it on the volley, but he is unable to keep the strike on target."
25',action,"Strong defending from Ranocchia, who uses all of his experience to hold-off Sanchez, who had weaved his way into Hull’s area, before diving in to block the former Barcelona forward’s goal-bound effort."
23',action,"After that flurry of action, the game has just found its rhythm once more now, with neither side having retained possession long enough to pose any serious threat to the other in recent moments..."
19',action,A nice stat if you’re a Hull supporter! Marco Silva won on his only previous visit to the Emirates – 3-2 with Olympiakos in the Champions League last season. He’s the only manager to lead a Greek side to victory away on English soil in the Champions League/European Cup. Can he repeat that feat today?
17',action,"CHANCE! What a miss from Sanchez! A golden opportunity for Arsenal, as Oxlade-Chamerblain feeds Iwobi with a wonderful pass. Ranocchia intervenes, only for the ball to rebound into the path of Sanchez. But, despite dummying his way around two defenders, the Chilean can only brush the outside of the right-hand upright with his effort."
15',action,"CLOSE! Arsenal counter, with Sanchez and Ozil combining to tee-up Bellerin. The full-back is in plenty of space, but rushes his effort slightly, and thumps the ball into the side-netting."
14',action,"SAVE! Brilliant play from N’Diaye, who picks out Grosicki with a sublime pass. The Poland winger dinks in a cross with the outside of his boot, and this time Niasse reads it, but Cech is on hand to parry away the striker’s header."
13',action,"Amid rumours of a fan-protest regarding Wenger’s continued stewardship of the Arsenal side, there are plenty of empty seats at the Emirates, though that could also be due to the flurries of snow in north London this afternoon. Whatever the reason, it is resulting in a rather flat atmosphere, and the hosts have done little to ignite this clash so far."
12',action,STAT -  Sanchez has as many Premier League goals this season as Hull's starting XI players combined total in PL history (15).
10',action,"CLOSE! What a chance for Hull! Markovic sprints down the right, leaving Gibbs in his wake. The Serbian drives into the area before sliding a cross into the six-yard area but, despite been unmarked, Niasse did not anticipate the delivery, and the chance goes begging."
8',action,"Hull can’t make anything of the set-piece, though, and soon after a slack pass from Huddlestone almost proves costly. Ranocchia was left flat-footed, but fortunately for the visitors the Italian recovers to block Sanchez’s strike."
6',action,"Hull have set up to counter at pace, it seems, with Niasse, Grosicki and Markovic all providing speed and energy going forward. It is N’Diaye, however, who finds space down the right, forcing Koscielny into conceding a corner..."
5',action,"Arsenal have won seven of their last eight Premier League meetings with Hull, since losing their first such game against the Tigers back in September 2008. However, if they are to continue that run today, it will have to be without the influence - from the touchline at least - of Wenger, who is serving the last of his four-game pitch-side ban, and is watching on from the stands."
3',action,"A really quick start from both sides here. First, Grosicki powers forward at pace, only to be halted by Koscielny. Arsenal work it forward through Iwobi, and though his cross is a poor one, Sanchez latches onto the loose ball, but Markovic gets back to clear."
1',action,"KICK-OFF! We are underway at the Emirates, with Hull - donning their black and orange away strip - kicking-off proceedings."
,action,"The teams are in the tunnel now at the Emirates, with just moments to go until the day’s Premier League action gets up and running..."
,action,"Meanwhile, Silva makes just two changes to his Hull line-up, as fresh from his maiden Premier league strike, Oumar Niasse replaces the injured Abel Hernandez, while Lazar Markovic starts in place of Evandro."
,action,"Just the one change from Wenger then, who also has a spate of injuries to contend with, though Hector Bellerin has recovered from the head-knock that he sustained at Stamford Bridge last weekend. Kieran Gibbs comes in for his first league start of 2017, replacing Nacho Monreal."
,action,"TEAM NEWS - Hull substitutes: Meyler, Maloney, Diomande, Marshall, Elmohamady, Tymon, Evandro."
,action,"TEAM NEWS - Hull (4-2-3-1): Jakupovic; Elabdellaoui, Ranocchia, Maguire, Robertson; Huddlestone, N’Diaye; Markovic, Clucas, Grosicki; Niasse."
,action,"TEAM NEWS - Arsenal substitutes: Gabriel, Lucas Perez, Giroud, Ospina, Monreal, Welbeck, Elneny."
,action,"TEAM NEWS - Arsenal (4-2-3-1): Cech; Bellerin, Mustafi, Koscielny, Gibbs; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Coquelin; Walcott, Ozil, Iwobi; Sanchez."
,action,"The team news is in now from a frosty Emirates Stadium. Let’s check on the line-ups, starting off with the hosts…"
,action,"And with last week’s victory over Liverpool under their belts, the visitors will be confident that they can cause another upset today, against an Arsenal side still reeling from their 3-1 thumping at the hands of runaway league leaders Chelsea last time-out."
,action,"On the other hand, Hull seem to have been revitalised since Marco Silva took over at the KCOM Stadium. The Tigers are still planted in the relegation zone, though a victory today would lift them up into 15th - temporarily at least."
,action,"However, the form guide suggests otherwise, with Arsene Wenger’s men having lost their last two Premier League fixtures."
,action,"On paper, this fixture represents the ideal opportunity for Arsenal to consolidate their top-four place ahead of Liverpool’s mammoth clash with Tottenham later on today."
,action,"Hello and welcome, football fans, to our LIVE coverage of Saturday’s early Premier League action. It’s a huge game for both ends of the table, as Arsenal take on relegation-battling Hull City."
