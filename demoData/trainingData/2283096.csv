,action,"Full-time at Santiago Bernabeu. After a shock Spanish Cup upset at the hands of Celta Vigo, Real Madrid bounce back with a comfortable 3-0 win at home to Real Sociedad, with Kovacic, Ronaldo, and Morata getting on the scoresheet for Los Blancos, who prospered after the red card brandished to Inigo Martinez. Thanks for joining us, see you next time."
90',action,Two minutes of added time have been allocated by the referee which is only serving in prolonging the agony for Sociedad who just want to head home to the Basque country.
88',action,"Madrid are just professionally seeing the game out at the moment with a series of short, stabbing passes along the defence and in midfield. With Sociedad not offering much, Zidane's men never really looked like they weren't going to surrender all three points after a disappointing week."
86',action,"A rare break forward for Sociedad sees Vela collects possession deep down the left flank near the corner flag. However, Madrid are let off the hook far too easily as the Mexican fires an attempted cross high and wide behind the goal for the goal-kick. Really disappointing in the end."
84',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Lucas Vázquez Iglesias sub-in Marco Asensio Willemsen . Just as Real Madrid wrap up the three points, Zidane makes his third and final change. Leaving the pitch is the impressive workhorse, Vazquez, and his replacement will be talented attacking midfielder, Marco Asensio."
82',assist,"Assist Lucas Vázquez Iglesias. Superb, and deserved assist for Vazquez with the cross."
82',goal,"Goal Álvaro Borja Morata Martín. GOOOOAAAAALLLLL FOR REAL MADRID! Los Blancos claim the third! Following a Sociedad corner which is cleared, Madrid counter at pace with Danilo leading the charge on the right. Vazquez eventually receives possession before chipping up for Morata, who makes no mistake with his bullet header at the back post! Three-nil."
80',action,"Ten minutes to go in the Santiago Bernabeu and it doesn't look like Sociedad are capable of mounting an unlikely comeback here in the Spanish capital. Even with the lack of threat towards Keylor Navas, they are now down to 10 men after Martinez was stupidly sent off so it would take a herculean effort to get two goals now."
78',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Sergio Canales Madrazo sub-in Esteban Félix Granero Molina . For Sociedad, Esteban Granero replaces Canales."
77',substitution,Substitution sub-out Mateo Kovačić sub-in Francisco Román Alarcón Suárez . Real Madrid also make a change as Kovacic leaves the pitch to a warm reception to be replaced by Isco.
76',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Lucas Vázquez Iglesias. Just as Madrid are given the man advantage after Martinez's dismissal, Vazquez sees yellow for a silly tug on Vela just outside the centre circle."
74',yellow-red,"Yellow/Red Íñigo Martínez Berridi. Dear, oh dear. Sociedad are now down to 10 men thanks to a moment of madness from Inigo Martinez as he completely takes out Casemiro with a wild swipe despite already being on a yellow card. The second booking comes, along with the subsequent red."
72',action,"GOOOOAAAAAAAAALLLL FOR REAL MADRID! WAIT! NO! OFFSIDE! From a Ronaldo free-kick, Morata rises high at the back post to power a header beyond the keeper into the net, but before the stadium explodes into cheers, the linesman raises his flag for the offside."
70',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Kévin Manuel Rodrigues. Even with this being a rather spikey affair, we are only now seeing our second yellow card of the match. The guilty party is Rodrigues who goes into the book after petulantly kicking out at Vazquez a few yards outside of the Sociedad box. Needless, really."
68',action,"Nacho attempts to channel his 'inner Marcelo' as he goes on a marauding run down the left wing before cutting inside ominously towards the Sociedad goal. However, even as he goes down rather theatrically, Navas clearly wins the ball to gain possession for Eusebio's outfit."
66',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Karim Benzema sub-in Álvaro Borja Morata Martín . First change of the match from Zidane and it is no surprise to see Benzema leave the action with Morata coming on as his replacement. Again, the Frenchman receives not the best reception from the crowd as he makes his way to the bench."
64',action,"Los Blancos seem relatively content to let Sociedad have the ball at the moment as all the possession is coming in areas which won't really generate much of a threat. Indeed, with this, Madrid have the opportunity to break free on the counter and utilise the pace of Ronaldo and Vazquez."
62',action,"Benzema, who along with Ronaldo has been the target of some boos by the Real Madrid fans, really hasn't been at the races tonight apart from a few decent touches here or there. There seems to be an uncharacteristic lack of confidence emanating from the Frenchman, which isn't exactly ideal with Alvaro Morata begging for a game on the subs bench."
60',action,Kroos collects the ball in midfield and catalyses a Madrid counter with a powerful run through the middle. The German then pops a pass out wide to Benzema but the striker is very easily stopped in his tracks by Navas who makes the strong tackle to win possession back for the visitors.
57',substitution,Substitution sub-out Willian José da Silva sub-in Xabier Prieto Argarate . Confirmation of Willian making way for Xabi Prieto.
57',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Mikel Oyarzabal Ugarte sub-in Carlos Alberto Vela Garrido . First change of the match now and it comes from Real Sociedad in what is actually a double substitution. Entering the action is Carlos Vela and Xabi Prieto, who some visiting fans think should have started the match, and they will replace Oyarzabal and Willian."
55',action,"Ronaldo looks really up for things now and is beginning to stretch out his considerable stride down this left wing. On this occasion, he makes his way to a shooting position but unselfishly attempts to shift a pass through to Benzema, only for the ball to be intercepted by Sociedad."
53',action,"After that finish from Ronaldo, it was interesting to see his celebration which consisted of an elaborate sprint over to the corner before gesturing to the Santiago Bernabeu faithful. Clearly, he is not happy with some of the stick he has been receiving recently!"
51',assist,Assist Mateo Kovačić. Superb pass from Kovacic for the assist.
51',goal,"Goal Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro. GOOOOOAAAAAAAALLLL FOR REAL MADRID! Los Blancos double their lead! Scorer turns provider this time as Kovacic slides a perfect pass in behind the Sociedad defence for Ronaldo, who makes no mistake with his gorgeous, dinked finish over the oncoming Rulli! Two-nil."
48',action,"Ronaldo beautifully finds the feet of Kroos with a backheel in midfield which allows Madrid to pounce ahead on the counter. The Portuguese eventually receives the ball back inside the box before looking to pull the trigger, but Navas comes in with a quite outstanding tackle to win the ball for Sociedad."
46',action,We are back under way in the Spanish capital!
,action,Half-time at Santiago Bernabeu. Real Madrid are on course to seal the win against Real Sociead with the 1-0 lead after a well-taken goal from Kovacic. Second period to come.
44',action,"INCHES WIDE FROM JUANMI! A quite brilliant move from Sociedad sees Canales exchange a couple of excellent one-twos with the former Southampton man, but the resulting strike on goal goes JUST wide of the right-hand post."
42',action,"Madrid have put in, by no means, a vintage performance so far but Zidane will surely be content with the fact that his side are heading into the break with the lead. There has not been a lot to pick between the two Liga outfits up until now apart from one period of quality from Ronaldo and Kovacic."
40',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Toni Kroos. First booking of the match now and it is a deserved, yet needless, one from Kroos as he scythes down Rodrigues a few yards in from the right touchline."
38',assist,Assist Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro. Ronaldo turns provider this time as he sets up Kovacic.
38',goal,"Goal Mateo Kovačić. GOOOOOAAAAALLLL FOR REAL MADRID! And in simple fashion! Kovacic, who has probably been the brightest player for the hosts, latches on to a penetrative pass from Ronaldo to run through on goal before placing an accomplished finish int the left corner. One-nil!"
36',action,"After a poor clearance from Madrid, Zurutuza collects around 40 yards out before popping a pass down the channel for Oyarzabal. The winger attempts to show some trickery to try and get beyond the defender on to his left foot, but Nacho defends well in the end to make the interception."
34',action,"When Madrid have possession, Sociedad are dropping back into a five-man defence and the home side look unable to break it down at the moment. Los Blancos rely so heavily on their full-backs to provide width it is no coincidence that they are struggling without Marcelo and Carvajal."
32',action,"The heavens have opened in Madrid as the rain relentlessly batters the Bernabeu turf. You would think that this would favour Madrid so that Ronaldo in particular could break in behind at pace, but Sociedad too have some speedy players in their ranks so should definitely fancy their chances of at least getting on the scoresheet."
30',action,"Ronaldo, even with his recent abject form, can usually be relied upon to at least provide a moment of quality here and there. However, with every misplaced touch or pass that comes, the Santiago Bernabeu faithful certainly aren't slow to show their annoyance. Not an ideal player/fans dynamic here!"
28',action,"Sociedad, for the first time in the match, get caught too far upfield and Madrid look to pounce with the speedy counter. However, even though Ronaldo fizzes a pass straight to the feet of Benzema, the Frenchman breaks down the move after being easily dispossessed by Rodrigues."
26',action,"We are just beyond the midway point of the first half now and, perhaps surprisingly, neither goalkeeper has been tested to any decent degree as of yet. With Madrid going through a bit of a rough spell, this won't exactly be song to the ears of Zinedine Zidane in the dugout."
24',action,"Rodrigues gets himself into a sticky situation near the touchline and attempts to clear, only for the ball to loop up straight into the air. With Vazquez sniffing around for a mistake, the Sociedad full-back is forced to concede the foul after a cheap shove to the back."
22',action,"Canales, who is always looking to impress against his former club at Santiago Bernabeu, attempts to break the deadlock with a strike from range. Although well-struck, the shot ends up being sent straight down the throat of Navas between the sticks for Real Madrid."
20',action,"Benzema cuts inside from the right flank and skips past a couple of challenged before popping a pass to the feet of Casemiro. The Brazilian attempts to return the favour with a pass in behind, but it is poor and ends up being disappointingly intercepted by Martinez at the back."
18',action,"Ronaldo bursts a gut to try and get on the end of a loose ball deep down the left wing and eventually collects possession near the corner flag. The Portuguese cuts inside ominously before looking to pick out Benzema at the back post with a whipped cross, but the Sociedad defence manage to clear in the end."
16',action,"Former Real Madrid man, Illarramendi, stands over a free-kick down the right channel and steps up to whip a decent cross into the penalty area. Navas meets it, but is unable to divert a dangerous header on goal which allows Navas to claim out of the air. Not the best marking from Madrid, and Benzema in particular."
14',action,"Martinez drives out of defence in commanding fashion as he looks to take the game to Madrid. The centre-back makes his way into midfield before being barged out of the way by Sergio Ramos, which prompts Sociedad to question the official as to why the Madrid captain hasn't received a yellow card as of yet."
12',action,"We get our first real glimpse of Juanmi as the he cuts inside from the left wing before popping a lovely pass out to the opposite wing for Zaldua. The former attempts to receive the ball again in behind, but Varane clears up on this occasion for the hosts."
10',action,"With the early bedlem of the match now out of the way, Madrid can now enjoy a period of sustained possession. Kroos receives the ball to feet and attempted to clip a precision pass in behind the Sociedad defence for Ronaldo, but Inigo Martinez is positioned well to make the interception."
8',action,"Having said that, the same can be said for Real Madrid who were knocked out by Celta Vigo!"
7',action,"Sociedad put up a decent fight in the Copa del Rey against Barcelona during the week, only to ultimately lose out to the Blaugrana. Even with the decent performance, it will be interesting to see if their confidence is shot by being knocked out of the tournament so recently ago."
5',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Íñigo Martínez Berridi. First yellow card of the match goes to Inigo Martinez. Not ideal for the Sociedad defender, who will need to watch his step at the back for the vast majority of this La Liga encounter,"
3',action,"As probably expected, Madrid have made a fast start here in front of their own fans. Ronaldo, who has came under criticism from some quarters for his recent performances, will certainly be eager to impress and get on the scoresheet."
