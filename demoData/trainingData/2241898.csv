,action,"There is the full-time whistle as boos rain down from the stands. Alexis Sanchez demolished the home side with three goals and an assist, a result which moves Arsenal up to third. They're now 13 games unbeaten in the league, while West Ham have lost their eighth, equalling their entire total from last season. That's all the time we've got, thanks for tuning in."
90'+3',yellow-card,Yellow Card Álvaro Arbeloa Coca. Yellow card Álvaro Arbeloa Coca
90'+1',action,"COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN SIX! Sanchez again gets the beating of the defence for pace, and slides a pass into the onrushing Ramsey. Randolph got there just in time though, and gets rid of the danger."
89',action,"Four goals in less than 10 minutes, with three of them falling the way of the Gunners. This had the potential of being a banana skin for Arsene Wenger's team, but led by their unplayable Chilean star, they've made short work of West Ham."
88',substitution,Substitution sub-out Mesut Özil sub-in Alex Iwobi . Ozil is also replaced by Iwobi.
87',substitution,Substitution sub-out Francis Coquelin sub-in Mohamed Naser Elsayed Elneny . The impressive Coquelin departs for Elneny.
86',assist,"Assist Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. After a wasteful first half, he's been much improved."
86',goal,"Goal Alexis Alejandro Sánchez Sánchez. IT'S FIVE FOR ARSENAL AND A SANCHEZ HAT-TRICK! That was just sublime from the Chilean again, although he was a smidge offside as he raced onto Oxlade-Chamberlain's pass. He always had Ogbonna beat, and dinked in a confident finish."
84',assist,Assist Mesut Özil. Ozil played the final pass into the Ox.
84',goal,"Goal Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. OXLADE CHAMBERLAIN STUNNER! He collects a pass at the top of the box, shifts the ball onto his right foot and with no one closing him down in a hurry, he smashes home a wonderful attempt!"
83',goal,Goal Andy Carroll. WEST HAM HAVE GOT ONE BACK! Payet hits a superb free-kick that smacks off the crossbar. Cech and his defence stand and watch as Carroll attacks the rebound with his head!
82',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Shkodran Mustafi. Mustafi fouled Lanzini and gets booked, conceding a dangerous free-kick in the process."
80',goal,"Goal Alexis Alejandro Sánchez Sánchez. ANOTHER BEAUTY FROM SANCHEZ! His first touch at the top of the box is tremendous, setting him in the perfect position to lash in a low finish into the bottom corner! And that's game."
79',action,"Oxlade-Chamberlain is stopped in his tracks by Arbeloa, and the visitors are nearly caught on the counter-attack. Moments later, Sanchez has space out on the right side of the area, but his dinked cross goes to no one except Randolph."
77',action,"The tempo of the game has slowed down, as West Ham struggle for ideas in attack. That baffles me more than anything - surely the introduction of Carroll makes the route forward quite clear?"
75',action,"WIDE OF THE MARK! Arsenal probe at the edge of the area, with Ozil teeing the ball into space for Oxlade-Chamberlain, who tries to go for that far-post finish again, but it's deflected wide."
73',substitution,Substitution sub-out Mark Noble sub-in Andy Carroll . Finally we see Carroll enter the fray as Noble departs.
72',goal,"Goal Alexis Alejandro Sánchez Sánchez. THAT IS JUST SUBLIME FROM ALEXIS SANCHEZ! He has Masuaku draped all over his back, but turns past the defender and bursts into the box. Ogbonna is slow to close down, and the forward lashes home the low finish!"
72',assist,"Assist Shkodran Mustafi. Mustafi will be credited with the assist, but that was all Sanchez!"
69',action,"MASSIVE DOUBLE SAVE! Payet fails to track back and Monreal can get to the byline. He cuts it back for Ramsey, whose shot is blocked by the keeper, Ozil follows up on the volley, but it's also stopped!"
67',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Laurent Koscielny. Koscielny and Fletcher square up again, and this time, it's the defender with the late challenge."
66',substitution,Substitution sub-out Theo Walcott sub-in Aaron Ramsey . Walcott will now be replaced by sub-in Aaron Ramsey.
65',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Winston Reid. Naughty challenge from Reid on Sanchez, and he's booked."
65',action,"VITAL BLOCK! Arsenal attack at pace after Xhaka's challenge starts them off. Sanchez controls the ball well and plays it to Ozil, who releases Walcott down the right, but his finish is thwarted by Ogbonna."
64',action,"Payet does excellently initially to get away from Walcott down the left, but he lets the ball run away from him and it goes out to a goal-kick, to a loud groan from the expectant home fans."
63',substitution,Substitution sub-out Edimilson Fernandes sub-in André Ayew Pelé . sub-out Edimilson Fernandes has been withdrawn for Andre Ayew.
62',action,"Sanchez runs into a brick wall on the right-hand side, before West Ham attack down at the other end, with Fletcher flicking a header into the arms of Cech from a decent cross. Just over one hour gone."
60',action,"WIDE OF THE MARK! Arsenal fashion a decent attack which ends when Sanchez blasts wide from the edge of the area. He's been the best player on the pitch, with his effort on and off the ball notable."
59',yellow-card,Yellow Card Ashley Fletcher. Fletcher steps on the ankle of Koscielny and gets himself booked.
58',action,"Dangerous times for Arsenal to navigate and to be honest, it should have never been this close. The Gunners had the chances to put this game to bed in the first half, but now it's going to be a close-run thing."
56',action,"Masuaku and Gabriel collide, which leaves both players in need of a moment to get their bearings. Carroll is warming up on the sidelines, and this will be a good time to introduce him with West Ham having the momentum."
54',action,"NARROWLY WIDE! Fletcher attacks a loose ball at the top of the box, and his effort spins the wrong side of the target. This has easily been the best spell of the game for the home side."
52',action,"West Ham are belatedly starting to wake up, attacking the Arsenal defence at considerable pace. I'm surprised that the visitors have decided to sit off this much all of a sudden, and it's getting the crowd involved."
50',action,"OVER THE BAR! Ozil stands over a free-kick and puts the ball into a terrific area. Walcott arrives at pace and gets his head to it, but can't keep it down! Another one goes begging for the visitors."
48',action,"Gabriel slips it forward to Oxlade-Chamberlain, whose cross is read well by Obiang. Arsenal are back on the attack, although West Ham are keeping more players back in the midfield areas."
46',action,Off we go again.
,action,"And that will do it for the first half, as Arsenal take a 1-0 lead into the break. The Gunners have been in complete control, with only wastefulness preventing them from having a bigger advantage at this stage. There's a lot of work for West Ham to do to get back into this one."
45'+2',action,"West Ham close out the second half in control of the ball, but fail to get an effective delivery into the area. Reid gets the fans excited with a terrific cross-field ball that wins a corner for the hosts."
45',action,"There's been quite a few injuries to both sets of players here. Collins has already gone off, and Oxlade-Chamberlain and Randolph have also gone down. Now Gabriel is in need of treatment, and he's clutching his knee."
43',action,"Arbeloa's miserable outing gets a stroke of luck as a terrible challenge on Coquelin goes unpunished. Moments later, a great cross to the back post is too high for Obiang, who can't get it on target."
41',action,"Arsenal pile bodies around the penalty area as Oxlade-Chamberlain sets up on the left but he hits another infuriatingly blind cross that doesn't find a teammate. The Gunners keep it alive, but Ozil and Sanchez's one-two doesn't come off."
39',action,"West Ham will do very well to get into half-time only 1-0 down. Arsenal have dominated this game at such a leisurely pace, and they'll be disappointed with themselves if they don't have a bigger cushion for the second half."
37',action,"COULD HAVE BEEN A SECOND! Oxlade-Chamberlain does well to prod a killer ball through for Sanchez, who has the step on his defender and surges past the keeper, but runs out of room in the end. Randolph is also moving gingerly after that play."
35',action,"I'm not sure what exactly the West Ham midfield are doing, but every time that Arsenal break, it's three or four players coming up against a back four that has no protection whatsoever."
33',action,"Oxlade-Chamberlain strides through the centre this time, and lays the ball into the path of Sanchez. The Chilean cuts onto his right foot and has a go from 20 yards, but Randolph grabs it at the second attempt."
31',action,"Another poor decision from Oxlade-Chamberlain. Ozil passes into Sanchez, who does well to flick the ball away from traffic into the path of the winger, who has space, but tries to open his body to finish, slashing it wildly away from the goal. He had Walcott open at the back post."
30',yellow-card,Yellow Card Francis Coquelin. Dumb booking for Coquelin to pick up as he kicks the ball into the crowd.
29',action,"West Ham have managed to fashion some good crossing positions for themselves, but they've lacked the deliveries and targets to make the most of them. We may see Andy Carroll later on as he is in line to make his first appearance since mid-August."
26',action,"That goal has been coming given the amount of space that West Ham have been conceding. The Hammers try to hit back at the other end of the field as Lanzini puts Noble in a great crossing position, but he can't supply a quality delivery."
24',goal,"Goal Mesut Özil. ARSENAL HAVE THE LEAD! Angelo Ogbonna's terrible pass is blocked by Francis Coquelin, and Alexis Sanchez is onto it quickly. He nips in past Reid's challenge, and squares for Ozil to tap in simply."
24',assist,Assist Alexis Alejandro Sánchez Sánchez. Great hustle as usual from the Chilean.
23',action,"A decent spell for West Ham is broken up by yet another Arsenal attack down the left. Oxlade-Chamberlain strides forward, and he has reinforcements arriving in the centre but the cross is into a defender first once again."
21',action,"WEST HAM NEARLY NICK ONE! Arsenal are caught with too many men high up the pitch as Mark Noble puts Lanzini in the clear. He soon has Laurent Koscielny for company and is forced to an angle, where his shot hits the side netting."
19',action,"Wenger will be pleased with the start that his side have made to this game. The injury to Collins has thrown West Ham's preparations out of the window, as they've had to switch from their planned 3-4-1-2 to a system with a back four."
16',action,"Arsenal are crawling all over West Ham at the moment, and once again, there's acres of space out on the left. This time it's Oxlade-Chamberlain who arrives in support, but his low cross is smothered by Darren Randolph."
14',action,"ARSENAL PENETRATE AGAIN! Arbeloa is having a nightmare out there as he's caught out position as Monreal advances. His low cross is touched by a West Ham player first, and nearly gets the killer blow from Ozil."
12',action,"DANGEROUS! Arsenal are finding a lot of joy down the left-hand side, as Monreal escapes to the byline and advances towards goal, but his low cross is scrambled away at the last second!"
10',action,"That was poor from Oxlade-Chamberlain. He gets the better of Arbeloa, who was out of position, and tries to bend a ball around the final defender for Ozil. However, he gets no spin on it. Arsenal would have liked those roles to have been reversed."
7',substitution,"Substitution sub-out James Collins sub-in Álvaro Arbeloa Coca . Collins tried to make a game of it, but he's simply not fit. Alvaro Arbeloa replaces him."
7',action,"Collins has plodded back onto the field for now, but he's not moving freely. Arsenal have the ball, and nearly fashion a one-two to carve the opposition apart, but Winston Reid clears ahead of Walcott."
5',action,"Injury problems here for West Ham as James Collins pulls up off the ball and immediately calls to the bench. The Welsh defender is back on his feet, but Bilic is still busy on the sidelines."
3',action,"Theo Walcott attempts to scamper to the byline on the right-hand side, but he's been swarmed by three players, with Gabriel not arriving in support in time. Will be interesting to see those two link up out wide."
1',action,We're off!
,action,"Arsene Wenger restores his regulars after cup action. With Hector Bellerin and Mathieu Debuchy both out, Gabriel is preferred to Carl Jenkinson at right-back. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain begins on the left, with Theo Walcott on the right."
,action,"Edmilson Fernandes and Arthur Masuaku come into the West Ham team, playing as de-facto wing-backs in a 3-4-2-1 formation. Ashley Fletcher's goal against Manchester United keeps him as the main striker."
,action,"Arsenal subs: Gibbs, Ramsey, Lucas, Ospina, Holding, Iwobi, Elneny."
,action,"Arsenal (4-2-3-1): Cech; Gabriel, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Coquelin, Xhaka; Walcott, Ozil, Oxlade-Chamberlain; Sanchez."
,action,"West Ham subs: Nordtveit, Arbeloa, Feghouli, Carroll, Zaza, Adrian, Ayew."
,action,"West Ham (3-4-2-1): Randolph; Collins, Reid, Ogbonna; Fernandes, Noble, Obiang, Masuaku; Lanzini, Payet; Fletcher."
,action,"The Gunners suffered only their second defeat of the season midweek, as Southampton beat then 2-0 at home to knock them out of the EFL Cup quarter-finals. With Manchester City losing, there's a chance for them to jump to third with a win here."
,action,"West Ham have not won in over a month, with that victory coming against Sunderland in the third week of October. Since then, they've knocked Chelsea out of the EFL Cup before seeing their own dream in that tournament ended by Manchester United."
,action,"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Premier League match between West Ham and Arsenal. The London rivals are at opposite ends of the table, but with their closest competitors all winning, a result is on the agenda."
