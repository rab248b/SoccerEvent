,action,"That's all for our live coverage, thanks for following along. Goodbye!"
,action,"A clinical second half from Manchester United sees them survive a bit of a scare provided by Wigan in the first half, eventually cruising to a comfortable victory as they book their place in the FA Cup fifth round."
90',action,FULL-TIME: MANCHESTER UNITED 4-0 WIGAN.
89',action,"Schweinsteiger is soaking up every minute of this. He's touched the ball more than any other player tonight, and has been rewarded with a goal and an assist, as many as he had in his last 33 games for the club."
87',action,"Martial has the ball in the back of the net for what looks United's fifth goal, but it's called back for a foul. Schweinsteiger is the culprit, as he caught his opponent with a high boot as he attempted yet another overhead kick."
85',action,STAT: Manchester United have been eliminated from just one of their last 40 FA Cup ties against sides from a lower division (Leeds United in 2009/10).
83',action,"It was shaping up to be a tense day at Old Trafford with half-time approaching, but Fellaini's goal before the interval, from out of nowhere really, just seemed to deflate Wigan. It's been a walk in the park ever since for the hosts, who have every reason to celebrate tonight."
81',assist,Assist Ander Herrera Agüera. Herrera registers an assist off the bench.
81',goal,"Goal Bastian Schweinsteiger. THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS! Herrera finds space in the area to send a tame header towards goal, but it serves as a pass for Schweinsteiger, who hooks a finish in at the near post with his back turned to goal! What a way for him to announce his return to the starting line!"
80',substitution,Substitution sub-out Sergio Germán Romero sub-in Joel Pereira Castro . The final change of the night sees Joel Pereira replace Romero for United.
80',action,"United in complete control now as we enter the final 10 minutes. They're dominating possession, keeping Wigan at arm's length as they look to suck the life out of the match. It's all fizzling out a bit here, and that's exactly what they want."
78',action,"NEARLY IN! Well what an impact that would have been from Browne, as the substitute pounces on a loose ball in the area and nearly sweeps home a finish with his first touch off the bench!"
76',substitution,Substitution sub-out Shaun MacDonald sub-in Marcus Browne . Wigan's final change sees sub-in Marcus Browne replace MacDonald.
74',assist,Assist Anthony Martial. It's a second assist on the day for Martial.
74',goal,"Goal Henrikh Mkhitaryan. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT! Seconds after Connoly forced a save from Romero at one end, United break expertly, with Mkhitaryan getting on the end of a terrific give-and-go with Martial to tap home a simple finish from close range!"
73',action,"STAT: This is the first time Manchester United and Wigan have met in the FA Cup. Their only previous non-league meetings are the 2005/06 League Cup final and the 2013/14 Community Shield, with United winning both."
71',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Will Grigg sub-in Ryan Tunnicliffe . sub-out Will Grigg's match is mercifully over as well here, as he's replaced by sub-in Ryan Tunnicliffe."
70',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Marouane Fellaini-Bakkioui sub-in Ander Herrera Agüera . United's second change sees Fellaini, the scorer of the first goal, replaced by Ander Herrera for the final 20 minutes."
68',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Timothy Fosu-Mensah sub-in Axel Tuanzebe . It's a competitive first-team debut here for sub-in Axel Tuanzebe, who arrives on the touchline to a rousing ovation from the Old Trafford faithful, as he comes on to replace Fosu-Mensah."
65',action,"Fosu-Mensah labours off and that looks to be the end of his match. It doesn't appear to be anything serious as he walks off under his own power, but Jose Mourinho doesn't see it worth it to take any risks, given the current scoreline."
63',action,"United have an injury worry here in the form of Fosu-Mensah, who lands awkwardly after an aerial duel and stays down. The medical staff comes out to attend to him for what looks to be a bit of muscle tightness, hopefully for his sake nothing more."
61',action,"STAT: Wigan Athletic have played Manchester United away on eight previous occasions, losing each game with an aggregate score of 1-28."
59',substitution,"Substitution sub-out David Perkins sub-in Yanic Wildschut . Wigan make the first change, and it's a positive one from them as winger sub-in Yanic Wildschut replaces Perkins."
57',assist,"Assist Anthony Martial. Martial picks out his first good delivery of the match, and it sees him pick up the assist."
57',goal,"Goal Chris Smalling. THAT'S TWO! And that could be enough for United! It's an excellent delivery from Martial, who has been quiet up to this point, to pick out the head of Smalling at the far post, and the centre-half rises above Warnock, finishing with a smart header back across the keeper!"
55',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Dan Burn. Burn recognises the threat and blocks the path of Martial, which sees him into the book. Professional foul, that, from the Wigan centre-half."
54',action,"VITAL RECOVERY! It's a massive save in the end from Romero to deny Perkins' effort, but it was the keeper's mistake initially that made the chance possible! That was almost an embarrassing moment for Romero, who does well to recover."
52',action,"BLOCKED! Who is this man?! It sure doesn't look like a year since Schweinsteiger's last start! He powers his way through a crowd and into the area, but a good recovery from Buxton sees him get an important block in."
50',action,"SHOULD HAVE DONE BETTER! A bit of careless play from Burn is pounced upon by Rooney, who feeds Fosu-Mensah. The full-back bursts into the area, but from a slightly offbeat angle, he drives an effort harmlessly wide of the near post."
48',action,"The second half starts much like the first, with some cagey play in midfield. The congestion should deal with itself going forward, as Wigan will have to start taking one or two chances in committing themselves forward."
46',action,Back underway at Old Trafford!
,action,"Wigan will be left to ponder what should have been, as a near flawless first half from the Lactics was undone in the dying moments as Marouane Fellaini stole a late lead for Manchester United with their first shot on target."
45'+1',action,HALF-TIME: MANCHESTER UNITED 1-0 WIGAN.
45',action,Into one minute of stoppage-time at the end of this first half.
44',assist,"Assist Bastian Schweinsteiger. In his first United start in over a year, Schweinsteiger has an assist."
44',goal,"Goal Marouane Fellaini-Bakkioui. UNITED HAVE MADE THE BREAKTHROUGH! Slow, patient building seemingly lulled the visitors to sleep, before Schweinsteiger picks out an outstanding delivery for Fellaini, who overpowers Connoly at the far post to get on the end of it and bounce a header beyond Haugaard!"
42',action,STAT: Will Grigg has had 12 touches and more touches in his own box (1) than the opposition box (0).
40',action,"YIKES! Well that's going to keep him up at night! Sam Morsy does so well in an advanced roll, turning and laying off for Jacobs, who has a clear sight at goal from 12 yards, but inexplicably swipes at the air, failing to make contact with the ball as the chance goes begging!"
38',action,"Important header! Strong piece of defensive work there from Connoly, to keep pace with United on the break and get into a position to head Mata's cross clear, which had threatened to pick out Mkhitaryan in all sorts of space at the far post!"
36',action,Sam Morsy has been absolutely superb for Wigan in this first half. Time after time he's found a way to win the ball back for the visitors with a strong or well-timed challenge in midfield. No one on United has been able to match his work rate.
34',action,"Pressure slowly starting to build now on the Wigan goal as we approach the final 10 minutes of the first half. A Mata free-kick is knocked behind by Burn, before the resulting corner causes a bit of panic inside the area. Eventually, however, the Lactics clear their lines."
32',action,"HE'S MISSED AN OPEN NET! That's the first real opening of the match for United, created by Fosu-Mensah's exquisite delivery across the face of goal. It arrives at the feet of Mkhitaryan at the far post, but with the goal glaring he bundles it wide of the near post! That looked a sitter!"
30',action,"STAT: Wigan have conceded just two goals in their five matches since New Year's Eve, scoring six."
28',action,"Fosu-Mensah concedes a needless free-kick, shoving Jacobs to ground near the touchline, just inside the attacking third. There was no immediate threat, and thus no reason to commit the foul, but he has. Wigan get their big bodies forward from the back, but the resulting delivery is poor as United clear their lines."
26',action,"DECENT HIT! The seas part for Max Power as he takes a pass in midfield and skips forward. He capitalises on the open space, driving a deliciously hit effort at goal from over 30 yards, but it's too central, as Romero is able to parry."
25',action,"FLASHED OVER! That's more like it! Impressive delivery from Shaw on the left. Burn wins it, but his attempted clearance falls kindly for Mata. The Spaniard strikes first-time on the volley, but lifts his effort over the bar! He's capable of much better than that."
23',action,"The best part of Wigan's game is how disciplined they are being. They break shape when they get forward, but once United win the ball back, the Lactics are so quick to organise themselves again. The hosts are going to need to produce something much better than they have thus far to break them down."
21',action,"Wigan are managing some good, controlled possession. They have settled in nicely here, which is one thing Jose Mourinho did not want to see. This has been a more than desirable start for Joyce's side, who continue to grow in confidence."
19',action,"STAT: The Red Devils have progressed from 11 of their last 12 fourth round ties in the FA Cup, losing only to Liverpool in 2011/12."
17',action,"Wigan have looked decently threatening from a couple of set-piece routines. Chances are expected to be few and far between for them this afternoon, but that's actually proven to be the case for the humble hosts, who have yet to thrust Haugaard into action."
15',action,"United need to adopt some width to their approach. Trying to build through Fellaini and Rooney in the centre simply isn't happening for them. Mata needs to provide more of a link, while the likes of Martial and Mkhitaryan should be dropping a bit deeper to get involved."
13',action,"The match is still waiting for the first attack of note. Wigan are putting in some great work off the ball in midfield, really making life difficult on the Red Devils, who are struggling to transition into attack. The trio of Sam Morsy, Shaun MacDonald and David Perkins, especially, are maintaining an excellent work rate."
11',action,"FIRST SAVE! A well-worked set-piece routine from the Lactics sees the towering Dan Burn win a header at the far post to tee up Connoly, who stings the palms of Romero with a well taken first-time strike from 15 yards."
9',action,"STAT: Wayne Rooney has scored 10 goals in 15 previous games against Wigan, including braces in three of those matches."
7',action,"Wigan are showing no real desire to press beyond the halfway line. They're allowing the hosts to maintain all the possession they want in their own end, but once they cross half, Wigan close down their gaps in a hurry, and it's been generally sloppy from United thus far when they do."
5',action,"United have settled in possession, but it's all very harmless from them as they pass it round at the back. There's not a great deal of energy to either side in the infant stages here."
3',action,"It's been a rather scrappy start to the match here, with some strong challenges being put in. Possession has changed hands, rather cheaply, on a few occasions in midfield, as neither side has been able to mount an attack just yet."
1',action,"AND THEY'RE OFF! United get the game underway, attacking right to left."
,action,"Warren Joyce names an unchanged starting line-up from the 2-1 victory over Brentford last weekend. Will Grigg leads the line, while Stephen Warnock captains the side."
,action,"Wayne Rooney leads the line this afternoon, flanked by Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Juan Mata and Anthony Martial, the latter of which returns after his recent exclusion from the squad. Luke Shaw is also back in the side, while Timothy Fosu-Mensah gets the nod at right-back."
,action,"Jose Mourinho makes nine changes from the League Cup match against Hull midweek, with just Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo keeping their place. Among the new faces in the XI is Bastian Schweinsteiger, who's awarded his first start for the club in over a year, as he partners Marouane Fellaini in midfield."
,action,"SUBS: James, Kellett, Tunnicliffe, Morgan, Jaaskelainen, Wildschut, Browne."
,action,"WIGAN (4-5-1): Haugaard; Connolly, Buxton, Burn, Warnock; Power, Morsy, MacDonald, Perkins, Jacobs; Grigg."
,action,"SUBS: Ibrahimovic, Blind, Young, Rashford, Herrera, Castro, Tuanzebe."
,action,"MANCHESTER UNITED (4-2-3-1): Romero; Fosu-Mensah, Smalling, Rojo, Shaw; Fellaini, Schweinsteiger; Mkhitaryan, Mata, Martial; Rooney."
,action,CONFIRMED TEAM NEWS:
,action,"That being said, the Lactics are currently in the midst of a three-match winning run, led by Warren Joyce, who was manager of Manchester United’s Under-21 side until November. Can he exact revenge on some familiar faces today?"
,action,"While both clubs have enjoyed recent success in the illustrious competition, their form is trending in opposite directions. Manchester United have almost closed the gap on the top-four in the Premier League, while Wigan are flirting with relegation to League One."
,action,"It will be a renewal of acquaintances between these old familiar foes, who have not faced off since the August 2013 Community Shield, following Wigan’s Premier League relegation a few months prior."
,action,"There may be 36 league places separating Manchester United and Wigan, but there’s just two seasons between their FA Cup triumphs in 2016 and 2013."
,action,Hello and welcome to Old Trafford for the conclusion of the fourth round of the FA Cup as Manchester United host Wigan!
