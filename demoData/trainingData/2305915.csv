,action,"The referee blows his whistle for the final time and Juventus celebrate a hard-earned and well-deserved victory - and equal their own record (25) for the most home league wins in a row. They battled hard to keep at bay a Roma side that continually pushed forward but, in the end, were unable to break down the determined hosts. The league leaders have now opened up a seven-point gap over the Giallorossi, giving them plenty to cheer ahead of what should be another difficult clash against Milan on Friday."
,action,FULL-TIME: JUVENTUS 1-0 ROMA
90'+4',action,"Roma win themselves a free-kick in the middle of the pitch that's played short before a lofted pass is thumped into the Juventus penalty area, but it fails to find Dzeko in front of goal and ends up sailing harmlessly out of play for a goal-kick. That should be that for the league leaders."
90'+3',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Stefano Sturaro. Sturaro has been snapping at the heels of Roma players all evening, and he's finally shown a late yellow card. I'm sure he won't mind too much though."
90'+2',action,"Dybala and Rudiger clash once again, but this time it takes place deep down the right wing. Unsurprisingly, Juventus decide to play the free-kick short after taking their time in an attempt to run down the clock."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be four minutes of added time.
90',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Antonio Rüdiger. Dybala is once again brought down whilst trying to counter quickly, and this time it's Rudiger who's shown a yellow card for his clumsy challenge on the Argentine."
90',action,"Another great save by Szczesny! Sturaro muscles his way into the Roma box and beats Fazio before shooting, but his thumping low strike is well saved by Szczesny at the near post to deny Juventus a second goal."
89',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Radja Nainggolan. A half-hearted Roma attacking move comes to an end and allows Juventus to hit the visitors on a quick counter-attack, but Nainggolan is there to cynically foul Dybala to stop him from flying into the Roma half of the pitch."
87',action,"A dangerous cross is whipped into the middle of the Juventus penalty area and finds El Shaarawy in a good position, but the substitute is unable to make decent contact with the ball and his headed effort is comfortably dealt with by Buffon."
85',substitution,Substitution sub-out Konstantinos Manolas sub-in Bruno da Silva Peres . Manolas seems to have picked up what looks like a hamstring injury and is replaced by Bruno Peres.
83',action,"Dybala makes an immediate impact as he picks up the ball midway inside the Roma half of the pitch before breaking forward and shooting, but his low shot ends up bouncing into the hands of Szczesny in the middle of the goal."
82',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Gonzalo Gerardo Higuaín sub-in Paulo Bruno Dybala . Juventus have made a late change, with Higuain receiving a rousing round of applause from the home fans as he's replaced by Paulo Dybala."
81',action,"A cross from the left wing isn't dealt with well enough by Barzagli, resulting in the ball looping out to El Shaarawy. The substitute has several Roma players around him but instead decides to shoot, and his rushed volley ends up sailing well wide of the goal."
79',action,"Manolas goes close! The free-kick is whipped into the middle of the box and nodded over to Manolas at the far post, but the ball ends up fizzing just inches past the head of the defender. Any sort of contact surely would have resulted in an equaliser for Roma."
78',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Alex Sandro Lobo Silva. Salah twists and turns as he tries to beat Sandro deep down the right wing, but he's dragged back by the Brazilian and wins his side a free-kick in an advantageous position. Can Roma make it count?"
76',action,"Chance for Perotti! Sandro loses out over on the left wing and allows Salah to fly forward before teeing up Perotti, but the latter's low, first-time shot isn't hit well enough to cause problems for Buffon in the middle of the goal."
74',action,"Roma move the ball around quickly deep inside the Juventus half of the pitch before Perotti fires a low cross off Mandzukic and out for a corner over on the left wing. The Argentine steps up and fires a dangerous cross into the heart of the penalty area, but the home side are just about able to deal with the danger before Fazio can poke the ball into the back of the net from close range."
72',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Daniele De Rossi sub-in Stephan El Shaarawy . Roma have made an attacking alteration, with De Rossi making way for sub-in Stephan El Shaarawy."
71',action,"What a chance for Sturaro! Juventus immediately come back and hit Roma on a quick counter-attack that involves Buffon, Chiellini, Higuain and Mandzukic. The latter picks up the ball in the penalty area and quickly tees up Sturaro, who then unleashes a rocket of a shot that Szczesny does wonderfully well to save."
70',action,"Sandro darts down the left wing before being fouled, resulting in a free-kick for Juventus in an advantageous position. A dangerous cross is whipped into the middle of the box and almost finds Mandzukic, but Szczesny is there to punch the ball away from the Croatian."
68',substitution,Substitution sub-out Stephan Lichtsteiner sub-in Andrea Barzagli . sub-in Andrea Barzagli has come on to replace Lichtsteiner as Juventus switch to a back three in an attempt to see off the game.
67',action,"Roma seem to be getting increasingly frustrated with their inability to break down a determined Juventus side. The visitors are seeing a lot of the ball but, due to good defending by the hosts, are failing to do much with it."
66',action,"Excellent defending by Rugani! Nainggolan charges forward on a great run into the Juventus half of the pitch before trying to slot a pass into the penalty area, but, once again, Rugani is there to intercept the danger with a wonderful piece of defending."
64',action,"Roma win themselves a corner over on the left wing that's curled into a dangerous position on the edge of the six-yard box, but Buffon does well to barge through the sea of players in front of him to punch the ball away from the head of Fazio."
62',action,"Strootman gives away a free-kick midway inside the Roma half of the pitch with a clumsy challenge. Sturaro steps up and fires a lofted ball into the box, but it's poorly hit and is easily dealt with by Szczesny."
60',action,"Salah cuts inside from the right wing and, once again, tries to get Dzeko into the game with a looping cross, but Rugani is there to skip in front of the Bosnian and deny him the opportunity to test Buffon."
58',action,"Rudiger, who has seen plenty of the ball this half, gets another opportunity to fire a cross into the Juventus penalty area, but this time it's Giorgio Chiellini who is easily able to clear the danger with a diving header."
56',action,"Salah and Rudiger link up well deep down the right flank before the latter swings a cross towards Dzeko, but it's easily cut out by Daniele Rugani and headed out for a corner that's comfortably dealt with by the home side."
54',action,"Juventus come back again quickly through Lichtsteiner, who then swings a cross into the heart of the box. It finds Higuain in a good position but is slightly overhit, which denies the Argentine a chance to send a header towards goal."
53',action,"Mandzukic breaks into the right-hand side of the Roma penalty area and quickly tries to tee up Higuain with a reverse pass, but he's closed down quickly by Fazio and loses out to the Argentine."
52',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Miralem Pjanić sub-in Juan Guillermo Cuadrado Bello . Pjanic will play no further part in the game, and he's replaced by Juan Cuadrado."

50',action,Pjanic seems to be struggling with a hip problem after battling with Rudiger once again. He certainly seems to be in a lot of discomfort as he receives medical treatment near to the byline.
48',action,"Sandro gets forward well down the left wing before forcing Rudiger into poking the ball out for a corner. Pjanic steps up and curls a cross into the middle of the penalty area, but Manolas does well to clear the danger with a towering header."
46',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Gerson Santos da Silva sub-in Mohamed Salah Ghaly . Roma have made one substitution during the half-time break, with Gerson, who offered little going forward, making way for Mohamed Salah."
46',action,And we're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half.
,action,"It's been an even and hard-fought opening 45 minutes, but Juventus deservedly head into the half-time break with a one-goal lead thanks to a moment of brilliance from Higuain. Since then, the home side have largely been on the back foot as they try to hold on to their slender advantage, and they've largely done well to do so thanks to lacklustre attacking from Roma. Nainggolan and Perotti started to get into the game in the latter stage of the first half, but, overall, it's so far been frustrating for the Giallorossi."
,action,HALF-TIME: JUVENTUS 1-0 ROMA
45',action,"Nainggolan, who has started to come into the game, skips past two players before Perotti, who again wins his side a corner. It's played short to Emerson before Perotti eventually swings a cross into the penalty area, but it's well dealt with by the home side."
43',action,"Once again, Roma hold on to possession for a long time as they try to carve out a chance on goal, but a promising attacking move is brought to a disappointing end by Rudiger, who sends a pass away from Gerson and out for a throw-in."
41',action,"Perotti twists and turns over on the left wing before swinging a cross into the Juventus box that De Rossi heads off a defender and out for a corner. The set-piece is whipped into a great position before dropping to Manolas, but the centre-back's snatched shot deflects off Lichtsteiner and away from goal."
39',action,"Roma patiently pass the ball around in the middle of the pitch as they try to find a way through the sea of black and white shirts camped in front of them. They're unable to do so, however, and Rudiger eventually fires a poor pass straight into the feet of Sturaro."
37',action,"What a save by Szczesny! A corner is whipped towards the far post and finds Higuain in space, but the striker's rocket of a half-volley is somehow kept out by the outstretched limbs of the Roma goalkeeper."
36',action,"Roma lose possession on the halfway line and Juventus immediately hit them on a swift counter-attack. Khedira breaks down the right wing on a marauding run before trying to swing a cross over to Higuain, but Manolas is there to cut out the danger with a diving header."
34',action,"Perotti breaks down the left flank on another good run before chipping a pass over the Juventus back line and towards Nainggolan. The Belgian does well to latch on to the ball at the near post and pokes a shot towards goal, but it hits the chest of Buffon before ricocheting off the midfielder and out for a goal-kick."
32',action,"Perotti and Dzeko link up well deep down the left wing before the latter cuts into the penalty area. He heads to the byline and then attempts to set up Kevin Strootman with a chipped pass over to the edge of the box, but Khedira is there to cut out the danger at the vital moment."
30',action,"Roma lose the ball in the middle of the pitch and allow Higuain the chance to break forward on a quick counter-attack, but, instead of lumping a cross into the box, the Argentine tries to tee up Khedira and takes the sting out of the attack."

27',action,"De Rossi steps up and sends a well-placed cross over to the far post, but Manolas is unable to reach the ball in front of goal, despite doing well to rise high above Alex Sandro."

26',action,"Diego Perotti cuts inside from the left wing and skips past Stephan Lichtsteiner before trying to pick out Dzeko with a dangerous cross, but it's sent slightly too near to Buffon and is easily collected by the veteran goalkeeper."
25',action,"Roma keep putting pressure on Juventus as they continue to enjoy themselves inside the home side's half of the pitch. Nainggolan picks up the ball in a pocket of space and immediately darts into the box and shoots, but his strike from the left-hand side of the penalty area flies straight into the side-netting."
24',action,"Rudiger latches on to a loose ball and quickly flies down the right wing on a marauding run. He spots a good run forward from Radja Nainggolan and does well to pick out the Belgian with a curling cross, but it's slightly behind the midfielder and he's unable to control the ball."
22',action,"Roma are awarded a free-kick midway inside the Juventus half of the pitch and have a rare opportunity to swing a cross into the Juventus penalty area. De Rossi does so and almost finds a teammate, but the home side have plenty of bodies back to deal with the danger."
20',action,"Another chance for Higuain! A dangerous cross flies into the middle of the Roma box and finds Sturaro, who quickly nods the ball back to Higuain.

16',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Edin Džeko. Gerson goes down outside of the Juventus penalty area and screams for a free-kick, but the referee isn't at all interested and waves play on. Edin Dzeko isn't very pleased with the decision and makes his feelings known, resulting in him receiving a booking for dissent."
14',assist,"Assist Sami Khedira. It was Khedira who set up Higuain, but that goal was all about the Argentine, who showed great footwork before beating Szczesny with a wonderful strike."
14',goal,"Goal Gonzalo Gerardo Higuaín. GOAL! What a strike by Higuain! The Argentine cuts inside from the right of the Roma box and skips past Manolas with ease before shooting, and his rocket of a shot from the edge of the penalty area leaves Szczesny with no chance as it flies into the top left-hand corner of the net."
13',action,"Juventus work the ball around nicely as they continue to put pressure on Roma. Sturaro picks up possession in a pocket of space just outside of the penalty area and quickly tries to tee up Mandzukic, but the Croatian is out-muscled before he can spin and shoot."

Despite that, the Old Lady’s record at home is one to be admired, as they haven’t lost a single league game against Roma in Turin since January 2010."
,action,"As for Roma, they are arguably the team to beat in Serie A and head to Turin in excellent form. The Giallorossi have lost just one of their previous 10 league games, with Lazio and Milan both losing against Luciano Spalletti’s impressive side in recent weeks. The victory against Milan was a particularly hard-fought one and that showcased the great resolve the team have shown this season."
,action,"Juventus were given a scare by Genoa when they unexpectedly lost 3-1 at the end of November, but since then they’ve been in fine form and head into today’s game with back-to-back wins under their belts. They most recently tasted victory in the Derby della Mole, setting them up for a clash that they really can’t afford to lose."
,action,"Tonight’s clash is arguably the best of the weekend, as it brings together the league’s top two sides in what is guaranteed to be a fierce battle. Juventus currently sit top of the table, despite rarely getting out of second gear in many of their games thus far, but Roma are fast approaching and can close the gap to just one point with a victory here today."
