,action,"FULL-TIME! Simeone goes ballistic at the final whistle, as Real Madrid draw 1-1 with Atletico Madric in LaLiga! A late goal from Griezmann has allowed for Barcelona to try and close the gap on Los Blancos at La Rosaleda tonight, after the hosts appeared to have everything sewn up. Pepe opened the scoring, before Zidane's men went on to dominate, but Atletico's star Frenchman popped up with a late say in proceedings. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+3',action,"Both sides have been wasting their opportunities to get the ball into the final third, with Correa playing an awful through ball straight to Sergio Ramos, before Modric wastes a free-kick for Real Madrid. Zidane's men haven't looked good in the last half an hour at all."
90'+1',action,There are four minutes of stoppage time for either of these two sides to find themselves a winner.
90',action,"Suddenly, the momentum is with Atletico. Since their equaliser, the majority of the play has been inside the hosts' half. Partey picks up possession, after a terrible pass out from Sergio Ramos again, but the Ghanaian substitute's through ball is collected by Navas while looking for Griezmann."
89',yellow-card,Yellow Card Jorge Resurrección Merodio. Koke gets a booking for timewasting over a free-kick.
88',yellow-card,Yellow Card Daniel Carvajal Ramos. Carvajal gets a yellow card for a cynical challenge about 25 yards out from his own box.
88',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Yannick Ferreira Carrasco sub-in José María Giménez de Vargas . Zidane's men now need to rally again and look for a winner, as their decision to sit back hasn't seen them through until the death. Gimenez is introduced for Carrasco, as Simeone makes a negative switch."
85',assist,Assist Ángel Martín Correa. Correa picks his moment brilliantly to part the Real Madrid defence and lay a pass into the path of Griezmann.
85',goal,"Goal Antoine Griezmann. GOOOOOOOAL! GRIEZMANN MAKES IT 1-1 OUT OF NOWHERE! The Frenchman is slipped through brilliantly by Correa, before scampering into the penalty area and sliding in to poke a finish under the onrushing body of Navas. An upset is on the cards!"
83',action,"Less than 10 minutes remain for Real Madrid to see out, with Atletico pushing on in search of an equaliser that would upset the hosts' apple cart. Zidane's front three haven't seen much of the ball in the last quarter of an hour, with the visitors getting onto the front foot ever so slightly. Partey is trying to help tip the balance in midfield."
81',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Gareth Frank Bale sub-in Lucas Vázquez Iglesias . Zidane makes his second change, with Bale replaced by Lucas Vazquez. The Wales international has been very quiet indeed."
80',action,"Atletico are trying to keep possession and work their way upfield patiently, with Simeone's side looking to Partey to help them drive forward with purpose. Juanfran and Filipe Luis are pushing on too, with Real Madrid forced onto the back foot. Los Blancos' supporters are getting just a little bit anxious now."
78',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Fernando José Torres Sanz sub-in Thomas Teye Partey . Torres takes his leave for the away side, with Partey introduced. Correa will push up a little higher as a result."
76',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Toni Kroos sub-in Francisco Román Alarcón Suárez . Juanfran is found out on the right flank yet again, but this time the full-back's cross is nodded clear by Sergio Ramos. Real Madrid take advantage of the break in play to replace Kroos. Isco comes on in his place, after a rough second half."
75',action,"OFFSIDE! Griezmann tried an over-head kick from inside the penalty area, after a good run down the right from Juanfran. He caught it beautifully, forcing Navas into a good save, but the flag was raised anyway."
74',action,"Carvajal finds Bale on the edge of the box, with the Welshman checking infield onto his preferred left foot. He tries to shoot, but drags an awful effort a long way wide of the post while offbalance. Real Madrid maintain their pressure, but a back-post shot from Marcelo is hammered wildly over the crossbar."
72',action,"Modric lifts the ball through to Benzema, who opens play out to Marcelo on the left. The Brazil international loops a cross towards the back post, but Ronaldo can't find a teammate with a hopeful square header. The quality in the final third for both sides has been very poor indeed."
70',action,"Bale is the target of a cross from the left-hand side, but the ex-Tottenham wide man can't turn it goalwards. Ronaldo keeps it in on the far side and delivers a second delivery into the area, but Benzema can't beat Savic aerially to turn the ball home! Real Madrid continue to have more possession, with Atletico beginning to run out of time to get back into this one."
68',action,"Benzema tries to help a through ball on from the edge of the penalty box, but the Frenchman can only find Oblak with it. Atletico break down the other end and find Carrasco on the left-hand side, but after cutting infield with some stepovers, the Belgium international curls a terrible effort a long way shy of the far upright."
67',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Kléper Laveran Lima Ferreira sub-in José Ignacio Fernández Iglesias . Nacho comes into the game for Pepe, who gets an ovation for his opening goal. Big test for the former to come into the contest and settle down quickly."
66',action,"Atletico are upping the tempo and showing a bit more intent with their forward play, with plenty of red and white shirts surging forward to press high. Zidane might have to make a couple of changes to take the sting out of this game. Pepe is trying to continue for the home side, but it doesn't appear that the Portuguese centre-back is able to."
64',action,"Bale is robbed of possession on the edge of his own penalty area, but the Welshman isn't penalised for a lack of sharpness. Griezmann tries to whip in a cross from the left, but it is headed half-clear by Pepe, before the Portugese defender is taken out by Kroos. He looks winded, as he appeared to take a knee to the ribs."
62',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Saúl Ñíguez Esclapez sub-in Ángel Martín Correa . Real Madrid are less than half an hour away from a huge result in LaLiga, but Atletico are slowly waking from their second-half slumber here now. Correa is introduced for the visitors, with Saul replaced, which will see Koke push infield and Correa swap with Carrasco on the flank."
60',yellow-card,Yellow Card Diego Roberto Godín Leal. Godin gets a yellow card for coming through the back of his man. No complaints from the Uruguayan defender.
60',action,"Good effort from Saul! The Atletico midfielder lets fly from around 25 yards out, but it flies straight down Navas' throat. That was very well struck indeed, he just didn't get the direction on it. Finally, a sign of life from the away side. Carrasco feeds Torres into the clear moments later, but Navas races off his line to make a brilliant save one-on-one!"
58',action,"Savic makes a good clearance to deny a cross in from the right by Carvajal, as Los Blancos continue to pile forward with confidence. Filipe Luis looks to release Koke down the left-hand side, but Modric covers across to make a tidy interception. Atletico just can't seem to play their way out of Real Madrid's press, with Griezmann starved of good service as a result."
56',action,"The opening 10 minutes of the second half could well have been match-defining, but Atletico are trying to rally. Filipe Luis breaking down the left and whips in a cross, but Pepe makes an easy block. Navas, in all honestly, hasn't had a great deal to do this afternoon. Simeone might have to look to his bench before long, but he hasn't got the same quality options available to him as Real Madrid."
54',action,"Real Madrid's home fans are making plenty of noise now, with Atletico needing to respond despite their players having considerably less in the tank. Zidane made far more changes from midweek than his counterpart Simeone. That goal will force Atletico to get forward with more frequency, but the hosts look in the mood now. Carvajal hammers a half-volley over the crossbar after a good run down the right from Bale."
52',assist,"Assist Toni Kroos. Kroos gets yet another league assist, as the set-piece specialist continues to cause opponents problems."
52',goal,"Goal Kléper Laveran Lima Ferreira. GOOOOOOOOAL! PEPE MAKES IT 1-0! The Portugal international is picked out by a free-kick delivery from the right-hand side, and thumps a powerful header across goal and into the back of the net! That was coming and Simeone now has some thinking to do."
52',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Saúl Ñíguez Esclapez. Saul picks up a yellow card for deliberate hand ball, as the Atletico midfielder denied a pass from Carvajal getting through to Bale."
51',action,"Real Madrid have started this second half brilliantly, with the hosts looking to take advantage of their fresh legs this afternoon. Atletico are being pegged back and kept very deep indeed. Carvajal and Marcelo are roaming into the final third with regularity. Simeone will just want his side to weather the storm and get through the next 10 minutes unscathed."
49',action,"GREAT SAVE FROM OBLAK! Carvajal is released down the right and guides a great cross to the back post! Ronaldo heads the ball back square across goal towards Benzema, but the Frenchman could only pummel a powerful close-range effort straight down the goalkeeper's throat. He was at the right place at the right time, there."
48',action,"Just wide from Ronaldo! Marcelo manages to clip a cross into the box from the left-hand side, picking out the Portugal international at the back post. Godin is beaten aerially by the Real Madrid forward, but he can only flick an attempt shy of the far upright. Oblak didn't look concerned in the slightest."
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu! As it stands, Barcelona will have a chance to cut the deficit at the top of LaLiga against Malaga tonight, with Atletico halfway to getting themselves a great result on the road."
,action,"HALF-TIME! All square in the Madrid derby, with Ronaldo going closest to opening the scoring! Real Madrid have seen more of the ball and have arguably had the better chances, but Oblak and Savic have ensured that Zidane's men are still being frustrated. Only one yellow card has been shown thus far, but there is definitely plenty of potential for more to come."
44',action,"Atletico are happy to sit deep as we edge towards the half-time break, with Simeone's men content with playing the bulk of their football within their own half. Marcelo tries to bend in a cross from the left-hand side, but the Brazilian's delivery sails directly out of play for a goal kick."
42',action,"Benzema is found on the left-hand side, before playing an awful pass beyond Modric and into an opponent. Real Madrid just aren't quite clicking up front. Carrasco curls in a cross from the right flank after a slow break upfield, with Carvajal and Navas combining to defuse the dangerous situation. Ronaldo goes down, claiming for a foul, but it appeared the Portuguese took a touch that was too far out of his feet to actually catch up with it - and he is fuming."
40',action,"Wide from Godin! Gabi whips in a corner, which isn't flight in properly, forcing the Uruguay international to nod a header back to the set-piece taker. With his second attempt, the Atletico captain gives his defender the chance to deflect a near-post header just shy of the far upright. Very close. Torres may have got a touch there too."
39',action,"Loose passes continue to plague this game, with Sergio Ramos the latest man to give possession away. Griezmann gets onto a poor backpass, before going on a mazy dribble out to the left-hand side. The France international is forced wide by Pepe, but still hammers a low finish towards the bottom-right corner. Navas has to be at his best to push it wide for a corner!"
37',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Carlos Henrique Casimiro. Casemiro shoots from the best part of 30 yards, but sees it blocked, with the hosts continuing to try their luck regularly from range. Atletico try and break, but the Brazilian midfielder is then forced into a cynical tackle that earns him the first yellow card of the afternoon."
35',action,"Carrasco shoots from the edge of the Real Madrid penalty area, with his effort deflected kindly into the path of Torres. The Spanish striker didn't expect it, however, with the ball flashing beyond him in an instant. Around 10 minutes remain in the first half, but an opening goal is proving elusive."
34',action,"The referee is allowing for a lot of physical challenges in this game so far, waving play on wherever he can in order to keep the game flowing. The hosts whip in a corner from the right-hand side, but Torres hooks away a near-post delivery from Kroos. Moments later, Bale loops a cross into the box, but Savic is the man to clear this time. Atletico are defending well."
32',action,"OFF THE LINE! SAVIC DENIES RONALDO! The Portugal international is picked out on the right-hand side and thunders a wonderful effort beyond Oblak, but the Atletico centre-back puts his head where it hurts to make a brilliant block. Real Madrid maintain their pressure with a Marcelo cross in from the left, but Bale can only head straight at the goalkeeper."
30',action,"Real Madrid continue to see more of the ball, but only that recent one-two from Ronaldo and Benzema has truly threatened Atletico. Everything is being played in front of the organised two banks of four set up by Simeone, and they look comfortable. Los Colchoneros appear rather happy to coast their way towards the half-time interval."
28',action,"Great save from Oblak! Benzema is the man to sting the palms of the Slovenian goalkeeper, who gets across well to deny the Real Madrid forward. Ronaldo and his French teammate play a neat one-two inside the penalty area, but the latter can't place a finish far enough away from the gangly grasp of the Atletico shot-stopper from 15 yards out. The resulting corner is directed a long way wide of the target, too."
27',action,"Over the bar from Saul! Casemiro gives the ball away terribly on the edge of his own box, but the Atletico midfielder can only race onto it and hammer an effort high and wide of Navas' right-hand post. Real Madrid are definitely making mistakes in midfield that their opponents will be able to take advantage of at some point."
25',action,"The lack of final ball continues to be an issue in this game, with both sides not at their polished best at present. Atletico are biding their time and then tackling firmly, with the referee showing himself to be willing to let quite a lot go in these early stages. Bale races down the right and cuts inside, but an eventual cross from the Wales international is hoofed away by Savic."
24',action,"The visitors are moving the ball around quite well, but eventually their possession is worked back to the likes of Savic and Godin and lofted upfield. Real Madrid are almost playing a 4-4-2 at times, with Toni Kroos stretching right out to the left-hand side, as Marcelo is struggling to deal with Carrasco defensively without any help. Zidane is clearly wary of Atletico on the break."
22',action,"Atletico earn themselves a corner on the right-hand side, which is initially cleared. Gabi gets back on it and whips in a second delivery, which Navas flaps at! Griezmann had half a chance to steer home a close-range finish, but the Costa Rica international did just enough to deny his opponent. The home fans are a little uneasy with their goalkeeper already."
20',action,"Pepe gives the ball away on the edge of the Atletico box, with Griezmann immediately sparking a counter attack! The Frenchman finds Carrasco out on the right, before the Belgian darts inside Marcelo and tries to shoot. His effort is very tame indeed and is picked up by Griezmann again - but the ex-Real Sociedad forward is caught offside while directing the cross-cum-shot onto the post."
18',action,"Gabi gives away a foul for a late challenge on Kroos, but there didn't appear to be much in that. Ronaldo clips a delivery into the penalty area, but Godin heads clear without any competition. Real Madrid continue to dominate possession and attempt to control proceedings, but they're yet to build any truly dangerous attacks. Only little snapshots have worried Oblak so far. Modric has had two long-range shots blocked already."
16',action,"Good save from Oblak! Casemiro finds Ronaldo on the left-hand side of the penalty box, with the Portugal international immediately dropping a shoulder and checking inside Juanfran. He pelts an excellent right-footed effort at the near post, but the Atletico goalkeeper is able to scramble across and ensure that he is equal to it."
14',action,"The visiting support are bellowing out with plenty of noise at the moment, with Atletico having eased their way through the early parts of this contest without any scares. The away team have defended well and won the ball back on the edge of their penalty box, time and time again. So far, Los Blancos have struggled to break their opponent's lines. Zidane isn't looking too happy on the sideline."
12',action,"Sergio Ramos gives away a free-kick in a dangerous area for clumsily standing on Carrasco's standing foot, which gifts Griezmann the chance to try his luck. He curls a delivery in with his left foot, but Marcelo nods clear with ease. Simeone will want his side to make the most of set-piece opportunities, but Real Madrid have plenty of aerial presence too."
11',action,"Good ball from Carrasco! The Belgian winger whips in a low cross from the right-hand side, but the ball skims off the turf and just shy of Torres' advancing presence in the penalty box. Real Madrid counter through Benzema, but the Frenchman runs into traffic on the edge of the area and is dispossessed. Very even start so far at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu."
9',action,"Casemiro opens play out to the right-hand side, before a deep cross from Bale threatens to find Ronaldo. Oblak is off his line smartly, however, to make a simple catch among traffic. Chances have been few and far between, with both sides clearly very wary of making the first mistake in the capital."
7',action,"Torres links up with Griezmann, before attempting to fire a low pass in behind Marcelo for Carrasco to chase, but Pepe is able to cover across to shepherd the ball behind for a goal-kick. The hosts respond with an attack down the right, but Carvajal plays a pass directly out of play ahead of Bale. The final ball hasn't quite appeared yet for either side, the nerves are still settling down."
5',action,"The home fans are making plenty of noise, with Real Madrid enjoying the majority of the ball so far. Atletico are happy to sit deep, with a few rash challenges being thrown into the mix already. Marcelo looks for Bale at the back post with a quick change of play, but Oblak is off his line very quickly to ensure that the Welshman doesn't get a chance to head goalwards."
3',action,"Just wide from Saul The Spanish youth international is picked out by a free-kick delivery from the left-hand side, but the slighest of touches from his head bounces narrowly wide of the back post. That had Navas worried for a second, he scrambled across nervously to cover his angles."
2',action,"Real Madrid are keen to get on the ball from the off, with Atletico definitely the better side when it comes to sitting deep and absorbing pressure. Carrasco is indeed playing out on the right-hand side of midfield, allowing for Koke and Filipe Luis to continue to build a partnership on the other flank."
1',action,"We are underway in the first half of the Madrid derby! Barcelona fans will be watching this one closely, with Real Madrid needing three points to stay firm favourites for the LaLiga title."

,action,"TEAM NEWS: Kevin Gameiro misses out due to injury for Atletico, with the likes of Nicolas Gaitan, Sime Vrsaljko, Augusto, Tiago and Miguel Angel Moya also absent. Fernando Torres partners Antoine Griezmann up front, with Yannick Carrasco returning from suspension to play on the right-hand side of midfield. Saul will continue in the centre of the park, with Koke presumably tucking in from the left, allowing for Filipe Luis to carry on his current purple patch with marauding runs forward from left-back."
,action,"TEAM NEWS: Raphael Varane is out injured for Real Madrid, but Zidane has a lot of fresh legs to call upon after resting plenty of first-team options against Leganes midweek. Luka Modric and Toni Kroos come back into the midfield, with Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo returning in the front three. Pepe partners Sergio Ramos at centre-back, with Dani Carvajal getting the nod on the right of the back four. The likes of Isco, James Rodriguez and Alvaro Morata are on the bench."
,action,"Both Los Blancos and the visitors have won their last five consecutive league matches, with Diego Simeone's men gaining the momentum required to leapfrog third-placed Sevilla in recent weeks. Antoine Griezmann has been on fire, with Saul offering creativity from central midfield, and Zidane will be wary of his opposition. Real Madrid have scored in their last 41 consecutive LaLiga games, meaning Atletico will need to do something special to stop them from making it 42."
,action,"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Madrid derby in LaLiga, in a game that could have real impact on the title race.

Plenty is riding on this local rivalry!"
