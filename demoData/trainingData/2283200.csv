,action,"As for Madrid, the win moves them back to the top of the table, two points ahead of Barcelona and still with a game in hand over the reigning champions. Their next game sees them take on local rivals Atletico Madrid in what is set to be a fascinating and fiery encounter!"
,action,"That wasn't an entirely comfortable evening for Madrid, who, despite going 3-0 up early on, were made to work hard by a determined and impressive Leganes side. The hosts battled hard and were unlucky to leave without a point, but they can certainly feel proud of their performance. With five points separating them and Sporting de Gijon, their focus must now move to this weekend's game against bottom side Osasuna."
,action,FULL-TIME: LEGANES 2-4 REAL MADRID
90'+3',action,"Luciano holds up the ball well deep inside the Madrid half of the pitch before spinning and teeing up Timor. The midfielder then fires a quick lofted pass over to the left flank and towards Rico, but it's poorly hit and fails to find the full-back. That should be that for Madrid."
90'+2',action,"Great tackle by Mantovani! Mariano looks set to become the latest Madrid player to go one-on-one with Herrerin, but before he can, Mantovani dives in from behind to dispossess the Dominican with a wonderful sliding interception."
90',yellow-card,"Yellow Card José Ignacio Fernández Iglesias. Machis causes problems for Nacho over on the left wing, forcing the defender into barging him to the ground to pick up a late yellow card. The resulting free-kick is fired towards the far post, where it flies just past the outstretched foot of Siovas."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be three minutes of added time.
89',action,"Almost a costly mistake by Herrerin! The goalkeeper tries to clear the danger with a headed clearance but can only send the ball to Vazquez. The forward charges into the box and goes one-on-one with Herrerin, but the goalkeeper makes amends for his error with an excellent stop."
88',action,"Isco is dispossessed on the halfway line and allows Machis to fly down the left flank on a marauding run, but Danilo is there to help out the midfielder with a vital tackle."
86',action,"Isco steps up and curls a cross over to the far post that should be easily dealt with by Herrerin, but the goalkeeper flaps at the ball and can only parry it out for a corner that Leganes are just about able to deal with."
85',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Unai Bustinza Martínez. Bustinza drags Asensio from behind as the Madrid man tries to bomb down the left flank, resulting in a yellow card for the defender and a free-kick for the visitors in a promising position."

83',action,"Lovely cross by Asensio! Leganes lose the ball just outside of the Madrid penalty area, allowing the visitors to counter quickly.

81',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Mateo Kovačić sub-in Luka Modrić . Madrid have made another late substitution, with Kovacic making way for Luka Modric."
80',action,"What an opportunity for Szymanowski! The Argentine charges his way past Marcelo and into the right-hand side of the Madrid penalty area before shooting, but his swerving shot curls wide of the far post after beating Navas."
78',substitution,Substitution sub-out Álvaro Borja Morata Martín sub-in Mariano Díaz Mejía . Mariano has come on to replace Morata in a late alteration for Madrid.
77',action,"The pace of the game has slowed down somewhat, with Leganes seeming to be running out of steam. They've pressed really well since conceding a fourth goal and have looked dangerous out wide, but they've finally started to tire as the clock runs down."
75',action,"An attempted Leganes attacking move fails to result in a chance on goal, allowing Madrid to counter quickly. Marcelo bursts down the left wing and then tries to fire a low cross into the penalty area, but it's well blocked and fails to pick out a team-mate."
73',action,"Bustinza gets himself into a good position deep down the right flank after embarking on a positive run down the wing. He then swings a cross into the penalty area that almost turns into a shot, and it flies just a yard or so past the far post after giving Navas a slight scare."
72',substitution,Substitution sub-out James David Rodríguez Rubio sub-in Francisco Román Alarcón Suárez . Rodriguez trudges off the pitch and punches the back of the dugout after being replaced by Isco. He doesn't seem at all happy with the decision to take him off.
71',action,"Madrid have dropped off ever so slightly as they try to hold on to their two-goal lead. Leganes are continuing to do well to put the visitors under plenty of pressure, but, so far, they've failed to find a way back into the game, despite their best efforts."
69',action,"Almost a chance for Samu! Nacho clumsily handles the ball, resulting in a free-kick for the home side. It's taken quickly and worked down the left flank before a low cross is fired over to Samu, who stretches for the ball but can't get the better of Marcelo in front of goal."
68',action,"Lovely play by Vazquez! He twists and turns over on the left-hand side of the Leganes box before fizzing low pass across the face of goal, but, unfortunately for the forward, there's no one there to meet it."
66',action,"Bueno and Samu almost immediately link up on the edge of the Madrid penalty area after Leganes plough forward on another good attacking move, but the latter takes his eye off the ball slightly and loses out to Marcelo."

63',action,"Both sides are pushing hard for another goal, with Leganes doing particularly well in advanced areas. They're finding joy down the right wing when pushing forward, but they're playing with fire as they pile plenty of bodies forward."
61',action,"Vazquez is bundled over by Siovas and Madrid are presented with an another good opportunity to whip the ball into the box. Once again, it's Rodriguez who fires a cross towards the penalty spot, but Gabriel is there to meet the ball with his head."
59',action,"Luciano is bundled over on the left flank and wins a free-kick for Leganes. It's fired into the Madrid penalty area and towards the head of Mantovani, who catches Ramos in the back with an arm and concedes a free-kick of his own."

54',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Roberto Román Triguero sub-in Samuel García Sánchez . Leganes have made their first substitution of the evening, with Samu coming on to replace Tito."
53',action,"Vazquez goes close to making it 5-2! A poor attempted clerance from Dimitris Siovas bounces out to Rodriguez, who then quickly tees up Morata. The striker immediately pokes the ball through to Vazquez, who then shoots, his low effort is deflected just wide of the near post."
52',action,"Leganes are pressing Madrid really well inside the visitors' half of the pitch, which is frustrating Zidane's men. The home side seem really up for the fight."
50',action,"A Leganes corner from the right fails to result in a chance on goal, allowing Madrid to break forward quickly. The visitors work the ball around well before Kovacic is set up over on the right-hand side of the box, but he's unable to test Herrerin with his low shot."
48',assist,"Assist James David Rodríguez Rubio. The cross from Rodriguez was a really well-placed one, but the Leganes defence were caught all over th eplace and didn't do at all well enough in trying to deal with Morata."
48',goal,"Goal Álvaro Borja Morata Martín. Asensio twists and turns over on the left wing before trying to break into the box, but Martin Mantovani brings him crashing to the ground with a cynical challenge, resulting a free-kick for Madrid. It's swung into the penalty area and right on to the head of Morata, who easily nods the ball into the back of the net to wrap up his hat-trick."
47',action,"Leganes immediately burst down the left wing on a great attack before a dangerou swinging cross is curled towards the near post, but Ramos is just about able to make contact with the ball before it can find a white and blue shirt."
46',action,We're underway once again!

,action,"It looked as if Madrid were cruising their way towards a comfortable win when they went 3-0 up after only 23 minutes, but Leganes have shown great grit and determination to come back into the game and are now only one goal away from an equaliser. Both sides have enjoyed good chances in front of goal and that looks set to continue, meaning that it could end up going either way."
,action,HALF-TIME: LEGANES 2-3 REAL MADRID
45',action,"Thumping strike from Unai Bustinza! Szymanowski does well to get himself into a pocket of space deep down the left wing before curling a cross into the Madrid box. Kovacic fails to clear the danger and allows the ball to bounce over to Bustinza, who then fires a low shot from 30 yards out that's well held on to by Navas."
43',action,"Big chance for Danilo! After dealing with the danger, Navas quickly kick-starts a blisteringly quick counter-attack. Madrid move the ball around really well before Danilo shoots from the edge of the penalty area, but his strike is poor and trickles straight into the hands of Herrerin."
42',action,"Navas slices an attempted clearance and sends the ball looping out for another corner. Once again, it causes problems for the Madrid defence and Gabriel is presented with a free header, but he's unable to make decent contact with the ball and can't test Navas."
40',action,"Almost another chance for Madrid as Rodriguez sprints into the home side's box on a great run, but the linesman's flag is raised just as the Colombian is about to unleash a shot."
38',action,"Great save by Herrerin! Vazquez breaks into the Leganes penalty area and tests the hosts' goalkeeper with a thumping strike, but it's well saved and fails to re-establish Madrid's two-goal lead."
36',action,"Madrid try their hardest to push forward from the restart, but they're struggling to find as much joy against a Leganes side that seem to be full of confidence thanks to their two goals. Will the hosts be able to find an equaliser before half-time?"
34',goal,"Goal Luciano da Rocha Neves. GOAL! It's another for Leganes! A corner for the home side is curled into the heart of the penalty area and bounces off the head of Ramos before finding Luciano, who, completely unmarked in front of goal, is easily able to tap the ball into the back of the net. What a turnaround!"
33',action,"Poor play by Vazquez! Madrid quickly push forward from the restart and do well to carve out a chance for themselves through Vazquez, but his chipped cross-cum-shot is poorly executed and bounces well wide of the goal."
31',goal,"Goal Gabriel Appelt Pires. GOAL! Leganes are back in the game! Rico charges down the left wing on a wonderful run as he's left all alone inside the Madrid half of the pitch. He then cuts inside and fizzes a pass across the face of goal that deflects off Ramos and over to Gabriel, who then thumps the ball into the back of the net."
29',action,"Leganes are slowly but surely starting to come back into the game, and that's largely due to some space being left available by Madrid in the middle of the pitch. Luciano has made a few good runs forward over the past few minutes, and that could continue to be the case as the game wears on."
27',action,"Chance for Gabriel! Luciano holds the ball up really well on the edge of the Madrid penalty area before spinning and picking out Gabriel, who immediately unleashes a rocket of a shot from 20 yards out that flies just a few yards over the top of the crossbar."
25',action,"Luciano breaks through the Madrid back line as he tries to latch on to a wonderful pass that was fired into the penalty area, but Navas reads the danger well and cuts out the threat comfortably."
23',assist,"Assist Mateo Kovačić. That was really impressive play by Kovacic, but, once again, Leganes left far too space available in the middle of the pitch and made life easy for the Croatian."
23',goal,"Goal Álvaro Borja Morata Martín. GOAL! It's Morata again! Kovacic charges forward and heads towards the Leganes penalty area before poking a lovely pass through to Morata. The striker is easily able to beat the defenders around him before meeting the ball, and he then sends it curling into the top right-hand corner of the net."
22',action,"Leganes are really starting to struggle, and they're failing to get anywhere near the ball in the middle of the pitch. They're leaving too much space available to Madrid, who are doing really well to punish the struggling home side."
20',action,"Madrid break forward once again after winning the ball back from the restart. It's quickly worked up to Morata, who cuts in from the left flank and shoots, but his curling effort fails to trouble Herrerin and bounces wide of the far post."
18',assist,"Assist José Ignacio Fernández Iglesias. Once again, Madrid caused plenty of problems from a set-piece. Nacho comfortably beat his marker in the air, whilst the Leganes defence failed to pick out Morata at the far post."
18',goal,"Goal Álvaro Borja Morata Martín. GOAL! Just like that, it's 2-0! A curling corner from the right wing is fired straight to Nacho, who does well to nod the ball over to Morata.

17',action,"Danilo hits the post! The Brazilian gets inside and heads towards the penalty area before unleashing a lovely low shot, and it's one that flies just past Iago Herrerin before smashing the woodwork."
15',assist,"Assist Marco Asensio Willemsen. That was really good play by Asensio to tee up Rodriguez, but Leganes will feel really frustrated at having given away possession far too easily."
15',goal,"Goal James David Rodríguez Rubio. GOAL! Madrid have taken the lead! Leganes lose the ball on the halfway line, allowing Marco Asensio to quickly dart down the left wing on a marauding run. He heads into the box and then squares the ball over to Rodriguez, who is easily able to tap in a shot from just a few yards out."
13',action,"Vazquez and James Rodriguez link up well deep down the right flank before the latter tries to fire a low cross into the box and over to Morata, but Diego Rico is there to cut out the danger with a well-timed sliding interception."
11',action,"Chance for Luciano! Mateo Kovacic loses the ball midway inside the Madrid half of the pitch, allowing Leganes to counter quickly. Luciano powers forward before unleashing a rocket of a shot from 25 yards out, but it's slightly mishit and bounces wide of the near post."
9',action,"Lucas Vazquez is left in acres of space over on the right wing, allowing him to pick up the ball unopposed before charging into the penalty area. He ends up holding on to possession for far too long, however, allowing Ruben Perez to easily dispossess him before he can shoot."
7',action,"Szymanowski seems to be Leganes' main attacking outlet, and he's seen a lot of the ball so far. He picks it up midway down the left flank once again before swinging a cross into the box, but it's sent slightly too near to Keylor Navas and is easily collected by the goalkeeper."
5',action,"Leganes lose the ball in the middle of the pitch, allowing Madrid to counter quickly. The attempted attack immediately comes to an end, however, as Nacho's pass out from the back is poor and can only find Timor."
3',action,"Alvaro Morata goes close! The striker twists and turns on the edge of the Leganes penalty area as he skips past his marker. He then unleashes a low shot that looks set to find the bottom right-hand corner of the net, but the ball ends up rolling just wide of the far post."
2',action,"Leganes enjoy a good start to the game as they put pressure on the Madrid back line. Alexander Szymanowski does well to dart into the box before cutting on to his right foot and shooting, but his low strike is well blocked by Sergio Ramos."
1',action,"We're off! Madrid get us underway, attacking from left to right."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."
,action,"Meanwhile, Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane has made nine alterations to the team that featured in their last outing, with only Danilo and Nacho retaining their places in a heavily-altered line-up."
,action,"Asier Garitano has decided to make three changes to the Leganes side that started the draw with Real Sociedad on the weekend, with Unai Bustinza, David Timor and Luciano coming into the starting line-up to replace Erik Moran, Samu and Miguel Guerrero, respectively."

,action,"Leganes XI (5-4-1): Herrerin; Tito, Bustinza, Mantovani, Siovas, Rico; Gabriel, Perez, Timor, Szymanowski; Luciano."
,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this evening…"
,action,"Both Real Sociedad and Sevilla were held to frustrating draws by Leganes in recent weeks, whilst Barcelona only narrowly beat them 2-1 back in February thanks to a last-minute Lionel Messi penalty. The newly-promoted side have proven to be tricky customers in their first ever season in the top flight, although their search for much-needed wins since the start of the year has been a tough and rather fruitless one."
,action,"As for Leganes, they find themselves in a very different situation as they battle for survival at the other end of the table. Five points currently lie between them and 18th-place Sporting de Gijon, and, despite being unbeaten in their last four outings, they can’t afford to slip up due to the Rojiblancos also being in good form at the moment."
,action,"Deportivo Alaves were the latest team to fall to Zinedine Zidane’s men, with Karim Benzema, Isco and Nacho all hitting the back of the net in a routine win at the Bernabeu. Tonight’s clash represents what should be another comfortable victory for a Madrid side that has only lost twice in the league so far this season, but they will be well aware that they can’t afford to let any complacency sneak into their game in the coming weeks."
,action,"With two points and a game separating them from nearest challengers Barcelona, the league title is arguably Madrid’s to lose heading into the final quarter of the season. The leaders are certainly doing their best to keep their rivals at bay, as, since a slight slip up against Valencia in February, they’ve won five of their last six La Liga games, with only Las Palmas managing to hold them to a draw during that time."
,action,Good evening and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s La Liga game between Leganes and Real Madrid at the Estadio Municipal de Butarque.
