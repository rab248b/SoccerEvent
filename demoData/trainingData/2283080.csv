,action,"FULL-TIME! Barcelona win easily in the second half, romping eventually to a 5-0 win against Las Palmas. Suarez netted two, with Messi chipping in with a goal of his own, and Arda Turan and Aleix Vidal completed the scoring. A comfortable victory in the end, with the visitors left wanting to get back to Gran Canaria as soon as possible. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90',action,"Las Palmas win a corner on the right-hand side, but it comes to nothing. There is one minute of stoppage time at the end of this contest."
88',action,"Barcelona are happy to run down the clock with some slow, patient possession that asks Las Palmas to do plenty of chasing on tired legs. Messi is found scampering down the right-hand side, but a cross from the Argentine is flicked on and then cleared. The hosts are maintaining their pressure despite the scoreline."
86',action,"Arda and Alba combine down the left-hand side, but a low cross from the latter is cut out easily. Las Palmas respond with an attack down the right, but Boateng sees a delivery blocked by Mathieu. Ter Stegen has been very well protected today."
84',action,"Big chance for Alcacer! He fires a blank again. The Spain international is given the chance to get into the penalty area, but is then outmuscled slightly by a defender while Varas rushed out to make a block. He looks up to the sky in frustration."
82',action,"Barcelona have less than 10 minutes to see out at Camp Nou, with Las Palmas' pride taking a battering in this second half. Messi is picked out by a cross from the right-hand side, but the Argentina international is denied by the offside flag. That was very close."
80',assist,"Assist Francisco Alcácer García. Alcacer may not have his first goal, but the Spaniard picks out a good ball to assist Vidal."
80',goal,"Goal Aleix Vidal Parreu. GOOOOOOOOAL! BARCELONA MAKE IT FIVE! Aleix Vidal is the unlikely goalscorer, after being picked out running into the Las Palmas penalty area. Alcacer set back an unselfish cross from the right, and the former Sevilla winger tucks home a tidy finish."
77',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Marko Livaja. The referee brandishes a yellow card for a cynical challenge from Livaja, as the Croatian substitute clatters through the back of Messi."
76',action,"Early save for Ter Stegen! Boateng is fed into the clear and tries to curve a right-footed shot into the back of the net, but in reality the Las Palmas forward shoots straight down the goalkeeper's throat. That might well have been his first stop of the afternoon."
74',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Nabil El Zhar sub-in Marko Livaja . El Zhar is replaced by sub-in Marko Livaja for the dying stages, which may see Boateng pushed out to the wing for the remainder of this game."
73',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Sergio Busquets i Burgos sub-in Jérémy Mathieu . Busquets takes his leave, with Mathieu introduced. This change should see Mascherano step up into defensive midfield for the last quarter of an hour or so."
72',action,"Barcelona are happy to retain the ball and play the game at their own tempo, with Umtiti, Mascherano and Ter Stegen seeing a lot of the possession. Las Palmas are content to sit back and try to not see Varas concede yet again."
70',action,"We are into the last 20 minutes at Camp Nou, and Las Palmas probably wouldn't mind if the referee blew the final whistle prematurely. Viera tries to float in between the lines for the visitors, but a stray touch from the midfielder is mopped up by Mascherano."
68',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Luis Alberto Suárez Díaz sub-in Francisco Alcácer García . Suarez is replaced by Alcacer for the last 20 minutes or so, as the summer signing tries to score his first competitive goal for Barcelona."
68',action,"A corner delivery is swung in from the right-hand side for Barcelona, with Varas needed to scamper over to his near post in order to beat the ball away! That nearly went straight in. The hosts are playing with real confidence here. Arda breaks down the left, but an attempted pass into Suarez is cut out by Lemos well."
66',action,"Enrique's men are controlling proceedings and seeing much more of the ball, as Las Palmas continue to wilt in this second half. Setien's men are insistent on playing out from the back, which is still putting them under continual pressure."
64',action,"Las Palmas are sitting back with a back five at the moment. It doesn't matter how many players they plant behind the ball, however, as Barcelona keep creating chances. Messi flicks a pass over the top for Alba to chase, with the bounce setting up the Spaniard nicely. He lashes his half-volley over the bar, however!"
62',substitution,"Substitution sub-out André Filipe Tavares Gomes sub-in Ivan Rakitić . Andre Gomes takes his leave, after putting in arguably his best hour in a Barcelona shirt, with Ivan Rakitic replacing him."
62',substitution,"Substitution sub-out José Vicente Gómez Umpiérrez sub-in Mateo Ezequiel García . Vicente is replaced by Mateo Garcia in midfield for the away side, as Setien tries to shuffle his pack."
61',action,"Barcelona are in cruise control now, with Las Palmas needing to resort to damage limitation for the last half an hour in Catalonia. Three goals in seven minutes have written off this game as a contest. Setien will wonder what has happened to his players."
59',goal,"Goal Arda Turan. GOOOOOOOOOAL! ARDA MAKES IT 4-0! Las Palmas are imploding here. Suarez is released in behind the away defence, after being sent into the clear wonderfully. The Uruguay international is denied one-on-one by Varas, but Arda is present to slot the rebound into an unguarded net. He beats Lemos and Aythami with his finish."
57',assist,"Assist Rafael Alcântara do Nascimento. Rafinha plays a simple pass into his team-mate, with Suarez very much doing the hard bit."
57',goal,"Goal Luis Alberto Suárez Díaz. GOOOOOOAL! LOVELY FINISH FROM SUAREZ! That makes it 3-0. The Uruguay international manages to find some space in the penalty area and opens his body up, before guiding the ball just inside the right-hand post. Varas had no chance with that one."
55',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Kevin-Prince Boateng. Boateng gets a yellow card for punching a cross goalwards, after realising that he wasn't able to get on the end of a ball in with his head. He smiles, but that booking rules him out of Las Palmas' next game."
54',action,"Arda and Messi combine down the left-hand side, but the Argentina international isn't able to put in a good ball from the byline. Las Palmas respond with an attack down their own left, but Aleix Vidal covers across well to slow the venture forward. He has looked solid so far."
52',goal,"Goal Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini. GOOOOOOOAL! MESSI MAKES IT 2-0! Arda releases Rafinha to the left byline, with the ex-Celta Vigo midfielder drilling in a low cross. Varas meets the delivery initially, but spills it again, with Messi the first man to react. He lashes a close-range effort into the back of the net."
51',action,"Suarez tries to lift a pass out to Messi on the left side of the penalty area, but Roque Mesa cuts it out. Moments later, the Argentine forward is fed in behind Las Palmas' back four, but he shoots wide of the near post from a tight angle. In the aftermath, Lemos goes down with an injury, but the Uruguayan looks fine to continue."
50',action,"Good effort from Boateng! The Ghanaian forward is picked out by a searching cross from Helder, but he can only steer his header over the crossbar. Ter Stegen still is waiting to make his first save in this fixture."
49',action,"Enrique is still looking very nervous on the touchline, as he knows that Barcelona need to find the back of the net again if they are to be truly confident of seeing out the victory. The hosts come forward on the attack, with Suarez the target of a lofted pass in behind, but Lemos defuses the situation with a nodded pass to Aythami."
47',action,"Viera feeds a low pass into Boateng on the edge of the penalty area, which the former Milan midfielder flicks into the air to tee himself up for an over-head kick. His acrobatic effort, however, bounces a long way shy of the far upright. Ambitious, to say the least!"
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half at Camp Nou! Suarez's goal is the only difference between the two sides, despite Barcelona enjoying the lion's share of chances in the opening 45 minutes. Las Palmas need to buck their ideas up in order to turn this contest around."
,action,"HALF-TIME! Barcelona head into the break with a narrow 1-0 lead given to them by Luis Suarez. Messi has been kept out a few times by Varas, as the first half wore on, with Las Palmas making plenty of mistakes that the hosts have thus far been unable to fully capitalise upon."
45'+1',action,There is one minute of first-half stoppage time.
45',action,"Arda combines well with Alba down the left-hand side, but an eventual cross from the Turkey international is cut out at the near post. Moments later, Messi manages to win the ball from the Las Palmas substitute Aythami, but is then denied brilliantly by Varas in a one-on-one situation."
43',action,"Messi has another chance to test Varas from a 25-yard free-kick, but the goalkeeper denies him! The Argentina international swings a shot goalwards that threatens to creep inside the top-right corner, but the Las Palmas goalkeeper gets across very quickly to push the danger behind."
41',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Hélder Filipe Oliveira Lopes. The referee goes to his pocket yet again, as Helder is penalised for diving into a late tackle on Messi. He has been very busy during this first half."
40',action,"OFFSIDE! Messi and Suarez combine, with the former putting the latter into the clear, but the Uruguay international is pulled back before he has the chance to slot a one-on-one finish beyond Varas. That looked incredibly tight. Five minutes remain until the interval."
38',action,"Enrique is out on the edge of his technical area barking instructions, as Barcelona have less than 10 minutes to try and double their lead before the break. Lemos picks out Tana on the left-hand side for Las Palmas, before the wide man finds Viera on the periphery of the box, but the visitors' star man shoots high and wide from 25 yards out!"
36',action,"Arda is found jogging down the left-hand side, before playing a neat one-two with Suarez. The Turkish winger clips a cross towards Messi, but his delivery isn't accurate enough. Barcelona have really been piling the pressure on recently, but a second goal is proving elusive."
34',substitution,"Substitution sub-out David García Santana sub-in Aythami Artiles Oliva . Aythami is the man brought into the heart of the Las Palmas defence, with David Garcia unable to continue. The substitute has only just returned from injury himself."
33',action,"Wide from Messi! Varas makes a save but spills the ball to the Barcelona star, with the Argentine taking control and wriggling into space. He shapes to shoot, before cutting to the byline, and an eventual cross-cum-shot whistles beyond the far post."
32',action,"David Garcia takes his leave for the home side, seemingly due to injury. The central defender walks off and straight down the tunnel, with the Las Palmas bench left with the task of scrambling a replacement. He is yet to reappear."
32',yellow-card,Yellow Card André Filipe Tavares Gomes. Yellow card André Filipe Tavares Gomes
31',action,"Gomes shoots over the crossbar! The Portugal international is picked out by a lovely pass from Busquets, before shifting the ball onto his left foot. He sets himself, but blazes an eventual shot a long way high and wide of the target."
29',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Javier Alejandro Mascherano. Mascherano is the next man to go into the book, with the Argentine penalised for a late and painful tackle on Viera. That rules him out for the Blaugrana's next league game."
28',action,"A long pass finds Boateng, who tries to juggle the ball over Mascherano's head, but the Argentina international stands firm to outmuscle his man and thwart Las Palmas' foray forward. The away side continue to see much more of the possession, with Barcelona happy to let them keep hold of it in risky areas of the field."
26',action,"Barcelona's 4-4-2 formation is working well against Las Palmas' system, with Messi and Suarez keen to press the visiting defence. Arda and Gomes are enjoying themselves out wide, as they can play in isolation against their full-backs. Setien's men are struggling to create anything dangerous at all."
25',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Rafael Alcântara do Nascimento. Rafinha gets the second yellow card of the game, after cynically tugging on the shirt of Jonathan Viera."
24',action,"Great save from Varas! Arda drives down the left, before feeding a pass forward into Suarez. The Uruguayan clips a back-post cross towards Gomes, but the ex-Valencia midfielder can only drill a low shot into the goalkeeper. The resulting corner is cleared by Las Palmas."
22',action,"Rafinha blazes wide! The Brazilian is picked out making tracks into the penalty area by Messi, but then takes a touch before drilling a low effort beyond the far post. Barcelona are showing real intent when pressing forward, with Las Palmas' bright start being negated by a few poor mistakes."
20',action,"Arda is picked out on the left-hand side, before feeding a pass into the overlapping Alba. The Spaniard cuts a pass back to Suarez, who combines with Messi nicely. The Argentine slides another through-ball into the clear, inviting Alba to the byline, but a cut-back from the wing-back is cut out by Helder."
18',action,"The home side are pressing high and forcing a few mistakes in Las Palmas' build-up play. The visitors break down the right-hand side and swing a cross into the box, but Boateng can only stick his boot out to direct a terrible volleyed effort some way wide of the back post. Ter Stegen still hasn't had a save to make at Camp Nou."
16',action,"Barcelona threaten down the left-hand side, with Rafinha able to jink his way through some traffic and get into the box. The Brazilian lays a short pass off to Suarez, but the hosts' goalscorer is then denied the chance to shoot by Roque Mesa. Important defending from the diminutive midfielder."
14',assist,"Assist André Filipe Tavares Gomes. Gomes takes his time to pick out a great ball, putting his delivery straight onto the stronger foot of his team-mate."
14',goal,"Goal Luis Alberto Suárez Díaz. GOOOOOOOAL! SUAREZ MAKES IT 1-0! Andre Gomes is picked out making tracks to the right byline, and steers an intelligent cross into the box. The Uruguay international sweeps home a lovely finish, while Las Palmas are calling for offside - but Michel was playing Gomes on."
12',action,"Aleix Vidal is the target of a diagonal ball to the right-hand side, but David Garcia steps out well to make a timely interception for Las Palmas. The opening stages have been rather relaxed, with little in the way of a tempo. The referee has had no real decisions to make, either."
10',action,"Vidal goes on a driving run infield, before drilling a low pass into Suarez, but a poor first touch from the Uruguayan striker affords Las Palmas the opportunity to clear. There is a brief stoppage in play, as David Garcia goes down after an accidental stamp on his foot from Andre Gomes. The visitors are looking rather confident."
8',action,"The away side make some progress down the left-hand side, but Tana is robbed of possession by Aleix Vidal neatly. Setien's men are seeing the majority of possession, but Umtiti and Mascherano have been able to keep very close tabs on Boateng. It appears that Barcelona are happy to play on the break for now."
6',action,"Andre Gomes is picked out scampering down the right-hand side, but a cut-back from the Portugal international isn't controlled by Suarez nor Rafinha on the edge of the box. Las Palmas are enjoying some early possession, but they haven't managed to create any chances so far."
4',action,"Messi has scored free-kicks in his last three consecutive games, but the Argentine star bends an awful shot a long way over the crossbar after Suarez was fouled. Las Palmas have already been guilty of making a few mistakes in possession during the opening exchanges."
2',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Roque Mesa Quevedo. Mesa gets a very early yellow card, as the Spanish midfielder makes a cynical challenge as Suarez tries to escape in behind the visiting back four. The Uruguay international was hauled down."
2',action,"Suarez is found on the right-hand side by Messi, but Helder tracks back to put the ball behind for a corner. The set-piece delivery is whipped in and picks out Andre Gomes, but the ex-Valencia midfielder can't sweep a close-range shot goalwards, with Lemos making a block."
1',action,"We are underway in the first half at Camp Nou! Barcelona will be looking to get back on track in the league, after some disappointing recent draws, while Las Palmas will be hoping that they can defy their away form and cause an upset with their free-flowing attacking style."

Helder Lopes is at left-back, as Dani Castellano is still struggling with an injury, with Tana preferred to Marko Livaja in the front three. Kevin-Prince Boateng appears to be starting through the middle of the attack."
,action,"TEAM NEWS: Javier Mascherano replaces Gerard Pique for the home side, who is left out of the matchday squad, with Samuel Umtiti partnering the Argentine at centre-back. Sergi Roberto is rested, with Aleix Vidal getting a very start start at right-back. Andre Gomes rotates in for Andres Iniesta, with Rafinha continuing in central midfield. Neymar drops to the bench after a great outing against Athletic Club, with Arda Turan deployed on the left."
,action,"Las Palmas' only league win on the road this season came back in August, as Quique Setien's men beat struggling Valencia 4-2 at the Mestalla. Since then, they have lost five and drawn two, scoring just once in their last three jaunts away from Gran Canaria. After resting plenty of key players midweek, however, visitors should be ready for action."
