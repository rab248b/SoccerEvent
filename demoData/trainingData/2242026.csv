,action,"Southampton edge out an incredible high scoring game as Manolo Gabbiadini scores in his seventh consecutive match. The Italian netted alongside team-mates Redmond and Tadic to give Claude Puel's team a vital away win against a spirited Watford. Things began well for Watford, who opened the scoring after just four minutes through Troy Deeney, but their advantage was to be cancelled out before the half. Though Okaka got the hosts level late on, Southampton were able to find an extra gear and two more goals that even a last minute Doucouré goal could not cancel out."
,action,FULL TIME: Watford 3-4 Southampton
90'+4',goal,Goal Abdoulaye Doucouré. GOAL! SURELY THERE’S NOT TIME FOR ANOTHER COME BACK? Mbaye Niang whips in a dangerous cross which beats all the Southampton defenders and finds a surprised looking Doucouré who taps in just moments after coming on to the pitch.
90'+4',assist,Assist Miguel Ángel Britos Cabrera. Assist Miguel Ángel Britos Cabrera
90'+2',action,CLOSE! Boufal looks to add his name to the scoresheet as he bamboozles Younes Kaboul with a nutmeg before ghosting into the box. He takes aim but only succeeds in finding the side netting.
89',substitution,Substitution sub-out Stefano Okaka Chuka sub-in Abdoulaye Doucouré . That is the end of Okaka's day as he is replaced by sub-in Abdoulaye Doucouré.
87',substitution,Substitution sub-out Dušan Tadić sub-in Jordy Clasie . Puel is looking to sure things up now as he brings on the defensive Jordie Clasie for Dusan Tadic.
86',goal,"Goal Nathan Redmond. GOAL! THAT WRAPS IT UP FOR SOUTHAMPTON! It is very weak from Watford who appear to have had the stuffing knocked out of them by Gabbiadini's goal. Tadic finds Redmond in acres of space and the Englishman carries the ball goalwards. Prodl continues to back off and allows Redmond to unleash a vicious strike which Gomes once again makes a hash of, diving past the ball which rockets into the roof of the net."
85',substitution,Substitution sub-out Manolo Gabbiadini sub-in Shane Long . The goal scorer makes way for sub-in Shane Long who will see out the game for Southampton.
83',goal,"Goal Manolo Gabbiadini. GOOOALLL!! THAT MAN AGAIN!  GABBIADINI! It is a real shame for Gomes who has been immense between the sticks for Watford today, but he has dropped a clanger there. Substitute Sofiane Boufal hits a weak shot from distance which should be a comfortable save. Gomes however fails to gather the ball and spills into the path of the Italian. This guy is a poacher and does not waste those kind of chances. He rolls the ball into an empty net to score his fourth goal in six games for Southampton."
82',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Troy Deeney. What you might call a professional foul there from Troy Deeney, who chases after Yoshida before wrestling the Southampton defender to the ground. He gets a yellow card for his troubles."
79',goal,Goal Stefano Okaka Chuka. GOOOOAALLL! OKAKA GETS WATFORD LEVEL! They move the ball fast  and Success finds space on the left wing. The Nigerian forward beats Cedric for pace before sliding the ball into Okaka’s path and he makes no mistake with the finish. It is all square again!
78',substitution,Substitution sub-out James Ward-Prowse sub-in Sofiane Boufal . Southampton make their first change as sub-out James Ward-Prowse is replaced by sub-in Sofiane Boufal.
76',action,CHANCE! Holebas’ deep cross makes its way right the way over to Troy Deeney via an Okaka flick. The striker is in search of his 100th league goal but can only find the side netting on this occasion.
74',action,SAVE! Some very casual play in midfield from Romeu allows Watford to burst forwards. Cleverley drives on before sliding the ball into Okaka’s path. The Italian keeps his shot low but it is a fairly comfortable save with his feet for Fraser Forster.
73',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Sebastian Prödl. Watford have been second to every ball since going ahead in the first half, and Prodl is guilty of a late challenge on Tadic after the Saints man had skipped away with the ball."
70',substitution,Substitution sub-out Etienne Capoue sub-in Isaac Ajayi Success . Walter Mazzarri can clearly feel this game slipping away from his team and looks to take the initiative by bringing on the mercurial Isaac Success in place of sub-out Etienne Capoue.
69',action,"Redmond successfully outbattles NIang and comes away with the ball before sliding a pass in field to Tadic. The Serbian beats one man before picking out Ward-Prowse on the right wing. He slides the ball across the face of the box, but Gomes does well to collect the ball."
67',action,"Holebas delivers a long throw into the Southampton box and finds Britos. The defender attempts the spectacular and connects with a bicycle kick, but Stephens stands tall and blocks well."
64',action,CHANCE - Some nice build-up from Watford as they look to get back on level terms. Tom Cleverley flicks the ball wide to the unmarked Niang who loses his head and blasts well over.
62',action,"SAVE AGAIN! GOMES IS KEEPING WATFORD IN THIS GAME! An even better save this time, as a Southampton free-kick picks out the toe of Maya Yoshida. The Japanese defender directs the ball goalwards and Gomes is forced to react rapidly to deny a certain goal."
61',action,SAVE! The corner is half cleared by Britos and the ball lands at the feet of Tadic. The Serbian strikes hard and true and forces a spectacular save from Gomes.
60',action,Southampton clear the corner and fly back up the other end of the pitch. Nathan Redmond is the ball carrier and fires the ball into the path of James Ward-Prowse who is denied by a combination of Prodl and Kaboul.
58',action,"Watford have been up against it for a number of minutes now and look to relieve the pressure by firing the ball long. Deeney rises to win the flick on and almost finds the onrushing Okaka. Yoshida covers well, but has to concede a corner."
56',action,Dusan Tadic sprints hard to keep the ball alive and succeeds. His cross is headed away by Holebas but lands at the feet of Oriol Romeu. The former Chelsea midfielder lashes at the ball and it flies harmlessly into the Vicarage Road crowd.
54',action,"CHANCE - Gabbiadini demonstrates his pace as he sprints round Miguel Britos and drives towards the Watford goal. He wants to commit Gomes and delays his strike, but Britos has recovered well and slides in to deny the Southampton striker."
53',action,It is safe to say that the first ten minutes of this half have been far less eventful than in the first 45. Both teams look to be feeling each other out and are unwilling to commit too many players forward.
51',action,A well worked move from Southampton ends in disappointment as the ball trickles out of play for a throw-in. Oriol Romeu kept possession expertly before playing a one-two with Cedric. The Spaniard flicked the ball inside to Steven Davis who looked to release Tadic but was too heavy with his pass.
48',action,"Watford have started this half the brighter, and are looking to get the ball to Niang far more frequently. The Frenchman spots Deeney’s run to the far post and swings the ball over, but Cedric has tracked him well and heads clear."
46',action,Watford launch the ball forward and immediately we are forced into another break as Troy Deeney goes down with a head injury. A nasty clash of heads but the burley striker is back on his feet quickly and the game is back underway.
,action,The two teams are back out on the pitch and we are about to get back underway...
,action,"Southampton have completed an impressive turnaround in the first half to head into the break with a one goal advantage. Troy Deeney got the hosts off to a dream start when he turned home an expertly placed volley, but Southampton's response has been emphatic. Dusan Tadic has pulled the strings for Puel's men, and he levelled the scoring before setting up Nathan Redmond for a goal on the stroke of half-time."
,action,HALF-TIME: Watford 1-2 Southampton
45'+2',goal,"Goal Nathan Redmond. GOOOOOAAALL! EXCELLENT GOAL FINISHED BRILLIANTLY BY REDMOND! Southampton have turned it around here and it is thanks to some spectacular play from Nathan Redmond. The former Norwich City winger danced through a handful of players on the halfway line to start Southampton’s counter-attack before releasing Steven Davis. The captain moves the ball on to Tadic, who lays the ball back to Redmond. The winger steadies himself before firing with pin-point accuracy into the bottom corner to give Southampton the lead on the stroke of half-time."
44',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Stefano Okaka Chuka. Another yellow card is brandished, this time to the protesting Okaka. The referee believes the Watford man handled the ball deliberately and the instant replay would suggest he is correct."
42',action,SAVE! GOMES WITH A GREAT STOP! It is woeful defending from the hosts as they allow Ryan Bertrand’s throw to make it all the way through to Tadic. He spins and takes a touch towards goal before unleashing. But again Gomes is on-hand to spring across his goal and beat the ball away.
40',action,"Watford look to catch Southampton on the break, as Mbaye Niang drives rapidly down the left wing. Cedric does well to recover and put a challenge in on the AC Milan loanee but concedes a corner in the process. The ball is whipped in but headed away well by Jack Stephens."
37',action,Southampton are awarded a free-kick in what is fast becoming known as 'Ward-Prowse territory'. The young Englishman begins his trademark slanted run-up and whips the ball up and over the wall. Gomes looks concerned and fails to reach the ball which flashes narrowly wide of the left post.
35',action,An excellent exchange between Gabbiadini and Tadic sees the Serbian creator flick the ball through for his striker. Gabbiadini looks set to add to his impressive Southampton tally but is denied by the heroic Gomes who rushes from his goal to head the ball clear.
33',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Manolo Gabbiadini. Valon Behrami falls to the ground after receiving a boot to the face from Gabbiadini. The referee awards the free-kick and Gabbiadini goes into the book. Accidental, probably. Painful, definitely"
30',action,"Watford earn a series of corners with Southampton struggling to clear their lines. Forster is forced to tip the ball out for another set-piece, which is delivered deep but the referee whistles  for a foul committed by Okaka and the pressure is lifted."
28',goal,"Goal Dušan Tadić. GOOOOAAALLL!!! SOUTHAMPTON ARE BACK IN IT! Dusan Tadic has been the architect of all his side’s chances so far and he earns his reward with a well taken goal. The Serbian drives into the box and attempts to pick out the overlapping Redmond. Kaboul blocks the pass, but the ball rebounds to Tadic who drills the ball accurately into the bottom right corner."
26',action,"CLOSE - Capoue is capable of great things from distance, and Southampton catch a glimpse of what happens if you give the Frenchman space. The former Spurs man takes aim from 25 yards, and misses narrowly with Fraser Forster looking beaten."
24',action,"Southampton have never lost to Watford in their six meetings as Premier League clubs, and Claude Puel's men seem eager not to let that record slip. They surge forward with Steven Davis once again, but Watford have been resilient in defence."
22',action,"CHANCE AND IT'S OKAKA AGAIN! Holebas crosses again, this time from a corner, and as the Watford pack of players splits the big striker finds himself with a free header. Once again Okaka is unable to keep his effort on target, but it is another warning for the visitors."
20',action,CLOSE! Holebas swings in a cross as Watford attack and finds the head of Stefano Okaka. The man with an assist almost gets himself on the scoresheet but heads narrowly wide.
18',action,"Good defending there from Prodl, as Cedric whips a testing cross into the Watford box. The ball looks destined for the boot of Gabbiadini, but the big Austrian defender pulls off an agile overhead kick to deal with the danger."
16',action,"SAVE - Huerelho Gomes does well to make himself big with Gabbiadini bearing down on goal. The Saints striker has been clinical in recent weeks, but the Watford keeper stood tall and dealt comfortably with the Italian's low strike."
14',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Cédric Ricardo Alves Soares. A sloppy bit of play from Cedric, who concedes possession cheaply with a misplaced pass and proceeds to cynically haul Etienne Capoue to the ground. A deserved booking."
12',action,"CLOSE! Southampton have responded well to the early set-back, and are putting pressure on the hosts. Tadic dinks the ball into the path of James Ward-Prowse who unleashes a fearsome strike but only finds the side netting."
10',action,"Saints almost unpick the Watford defence, as Redmond and Tadic exchange passes. The English winger fizzes the ball in towards the in-form Manolo Gabbiadini, but Kaboul is touch tight to the Italian and puts in a decisive tackle."
8',action,The ball goes long from a Kaboul throw. He finds the head of Troy Deeney who flicks on and almost finds Mbaye Niang. Yoshida is across quickly to clear though and Southampton survive the scare.
4',goal,Goal Troy Deeney. GOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL! What a start for the hosts. Troy Deeney played a one-two with Stefano Okaka before volleying the ball into the corner of the net. His fifth goal in his last six Premier League games for Watford.
1',action,"And we are off, Watford get the game underway kicking from left to right."
,action,The two teams are out on the pitch and kick-off is just moments away...
,action,"Subs: Clasie, Long, Rodriguez, Cáceres, Boufal, McQueen, Hassen"
,action,"Southampton Starting XI (4-2-3-1): Forster, Soares, Yoshida, Stephens. Bertrand, Davis, Romeu, Tadic, Ward-Prowse, Redmond, Gabbiadini"
,action,"Subs: Mariappa, Success, Cathcart, Doucouré, Zuñiga, Arlauskis, Stewart"
,action,"Watford Starting XI (4-3-3): Gomes, Holebas, Kaboul, Prödl, Britos, Capoue, Behrami, Cleverley, Niang, Deeney, Okaka"
,action,"The teams are in so let’s take a look, starting with the hosts…"
,action,"The search for goals will be made more difficult by the absence of Mauro Zarate, who picked up a season ending knee injury in that game, leaving Mazzarri with fewer striking options up top. Yet Success has shown glimpses of brilliance, and on loan Mbaye Niang has proven a welcome addition to Watford’s front line."
,action,"The Hornets were unable to nick a late goal against ten man West Ham at home last weekend, with Isaac Success missing a gilt-edged chance with the final kick of the game."
,action,"Their opponents today have also been accused of inconsistency, with Watford boss Walter Mazzarri calling on his players to ‘stop sitting back’ if they want to win more matches."
,action,"The south coast club’s last five Premier League Games have delivered two wins and three losses, and there remains a sense of uncertainty about a team capable of big victories against Leicester and Sunderland but also uninspiring losses at the hands of Swansea and Burnley."
,action,"Claude Puel’s league failings have been covered for by cup form, but Saints fans will want to see the Frenchman steady the ship with a more consistent run of form."
,action,"This game sees two teams separated by just one point go head-to-head, as after an exciting EFL Cup run, scuppered by the superb Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Southampton’s focus now turns to reaching the 40 point mark and ensuring survival."
,action,Hello and welcome to LIVE coverage of today’s Premier League clash between Watford and Southampton at Vicarage Road.
