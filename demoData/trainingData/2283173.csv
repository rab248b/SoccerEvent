,action,"As for Granada, the defeat means that they remain buried inside the relegation zone, five points away from safety. Next week sees them take on Sporting Gijon in what can only be described as a relegation six-pointer. Atletico, meanwhile, are in action at home to Sevilla after their mid-week Champions League clash against Bayer Leverkusen."
,action,"It was a tough night on which they were pushed hard by a spirited Granada side, but Atletico just about managed to leave with all three points thanks to another important goal from Griezmann. The Frenchman, who was easily their best player all evening, popped up once again to beat Ochoa with a lovely downward header, and it's a goal that would prove to keep alive his side's hopes of pipping Sevilla to third place."
,action,FULL-TIME: GRANADA 0-1 ATLETICO MADRID
90'+4',yellow-red,"Yellow/Red Mubarak Wakaso. RED CARD! Granada's day goes from bad to worse as Wakaso is shown a second yellow card for a silly challenge on Griezmann from behind as the Frenchman tried to hold up the ball. The Ghanaian then argued vociferously with the referee, leaving the man in charge with no doubt that he needed to give the midfielder his marching orders."
90'+3',action,"Granada throw everything they've got at the Atletico back line, but they're unable to find a way through the sea of black shirts camped in front of them. Several crosses are flung into the penalty area and towards the mass of players camped in front of goal, but the visitors are just about able to deal with everything they're forced into facing."
90'+1',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Diego Roberto Godín Leal. It's all kicking off inside the Atletico penalty area, where Savic is bleeding profusely after receiving a flailing arm to the face. He takes his time in making his way off the pitch to receive medical treatment, and Godin is shown a yellow card for helping with Atletico's time-wasting."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be three minutes of added time.
89',action,"Two good chances for Atletico! First, Correa cuts inside from the right wing and tests Ochoa with a great shot towards the near post, but it's pushed away by the Mexican and away from danger. The visitors are able to come back once again, however, but this time it's Vrsaljko who fires his effort just wide of the goal."
88',action,"Ball after ball is flung into the Atletico penalty area, but, despite the number of white and red shirts camped in front of goal, Granada are unable to trouble the visitors. Atletico now have every available body camped behind the ball as they desperately try to hold on to all three points."
86',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Yannick Ferreira Carrasco sub-in Šime Vrsaljko . Meanwhile, Carrasco has made way for Vrsaljko in a defensive switch for Atletico."
86',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Matthieu Saunier sub-in Aly Malle . Granada have made a late alteration, with sub-in Aly Malle coming on to replace Saunier as they switch to a four-man defence."
85',action,"Atletico quickly win the ball back from the restart and give it to Griezmann, who charges forward once again. He flies towards the penalty area on a strong run before looking to shoot, but he's unable to do so and is dispossessed at the vital moment."
84',goal,"Goal Antoine Griezmann. GOAL! Atletico has scored what could prove to be the winner! The corner fails to result in a chance on goal, but the ball bounces out to Koke on the left wing. He takes a quick touch before curling a looping cross over to the far post, where Griezmann, who had been left in far too much space, is easily able to beat Ochoa with a brilliant downward header."
84',assist,Assist Jorge Resurrección Merodio. Assist Jorge Resurrección Merodio
83',action,"Luis charges down the left flank before poking a pass down the wing and into the path of Carrasco. The Belgian meets the ball well before trying to skip past Saunier, but the Frenchman dives into the forward and pokes the ball out for a corner with a wonderfully timed sliding tackle."
81',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Juan Francisco Torres Belén. After dealing with another dangerous Atletico attack, Pereira sprints down the left flank on an impressive run. He flies past the halfway line and then easily beats Juanfran, but the full-back cynically drags him back and earns himself a yellow card as a result."
80',action,"Fantastic chance for Carrasco! Griezmann and Luis link up really well over on the left wing before the Brazilian pokes a pass into the feet of Carrasco. He quickly spins round his marker and unleashes a rocket of a low shot, but Ochoa is there to push it away with a great save at the near post."
78',action,"Cuenca is immediately presented with an opportunity to break forward quickly after receiving the ball as soon as he steps on to the pitch. He spins and charges towards the Atletico box before cutting inside and taking on Gimenez, but it's the Uruguayan who comes out on top with a smart tackle."
77',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Héctor Hernández Ortega sub-in Joan Isaac Cuenca López . Granada have made their second change of the night, with Hector, who has impressed this evening, being replaced by Isaac Cuenca."
76',action,"Atletico, who have been on the back foot over the last 10 minutes, are finally able to break away quickly after another Granada attack comes to nothing. Griezmann sprints down the right wing before linking up well with Juanfran, but the full-back's first-time cross is easily cut out by Ingason inside the box."
74',action,"Pereira cuts inside from the left wing and darts towards the Atletico penalty area before shooting, but he's closed down quickly and is unable to test Oblak. The ball bounces back over to the left flank and finds Hector, but he too is unable to find any joy and the visitors hold on once again."
72',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Mubarak Wakaso. Saul picks up the ball midway inside the Atletico half of the pitch and quickly tries to skip down the right wing on a quick counter-attack, but Wakaso sends the midfielder crashing to the ground after his outstretched foot catches his opponent's leg. Once again, the referee reaches for his pocket and branishes a yellow card."
71',action,"Once again, Carrasco flies through the centre of the pitch on a promising run after being left in a pocket of space by the Granada midfielders, but he's unable to finish the move with a decent attempt on goal as his Ochoa is able to watch the Belgian's long-range effort fly comfortably wide of his right post."
70',action,"A curling cross from the right wing flies over to the left-hand side of the Atletico penalty area before being poked back to Pereira. He's in a good position and has a great opportunity to test Oblak, but he fails to do so and instead sends his first-time shot way over the top of the crossbar."
68',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Dimitri Foulquier. Luis easily breaks away from Foulquier and quickly tries to dart into the Granada half of the pitch and down the left wing. He's unable to do so, however, as Foulquier pulls back the Brazilian with what can only be described as a rugby tackle. Unsurprisingly, he's shown a yellow card for his challenge."
66',action,"Great play by Atletico! A lovely cross from Saul flies over to the right-hand side of the Granada penalty area and finds Griezmann in a pocket of space. The Frenchman meets it well and immediately nods the ball down to Koke, who forces Ochoa into making a strong save at the near post."
65',action,"Granada keep pushing forward as they try to find a way through Atletico's diligent back line. The ball eventually bounces over to Foulquier and finds the wing-back in a promising position just outside of the visitors' box, but his first-time strike is poorly hit and flies high and wide of the goal."
63',action,"Atletico are unable to break away on a quick counter-attack as a result of good defending from Ingason, and the Icelander then kick-starts an attack of his own. The ball is immediately sent up to Wakaso, who then unleashes a low shot, but it's poorly hit by the midfielder and bounces well wide of its intended target."
62',action,"After a frantic few moments that presented good opportunities on goal for both sides, the pace of the game has slowed down somewhat. As was the case for most of the first half, the battle for supremacy is taking place in the middle of the pitch, where Granada are continuing to press well."
60',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Osvaldo Nicolás Fabián Gaitán sub-in José María Giménez de Vargas . Atletico have made their second change, with Jose Gimenez coming on to take the place of Gaitan."
59',action,"Carrasco flies through the middle of the pitch on a great run as he speeds through a sea of Granada players. He does well to reach the penalty area and then unleashes a low strike, but Ingason is able to get a foot on the effort to send it trickling wide of the goal."
57',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Gustavo Adrián Ramos Vásquez sub-in Artem Kravets . Granada have made their first substitution of the evening, with Ramos, who has disappointed, making way for sub-in Artem Kravets."
57',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Yannick Ferreira Carrasco. An attempted Atletico attacking move comes to a disappointing end thanks to good defending from the hosts. They then try to counter quickly through Wakaso, but the midfielder is cynically dragged back by Carrasco and the Belgian is shown a yellow card for his poor challenge."
56',action,"Almost another opportunity for Granada! The home side burst into the Atletico box with plenty of numbers in their ranks, but they're guilty of overdoing things and Pereira eventually has the ball poked away from him after Boga's poked pass to the left is slightly underhit."
55',action,"And now Griezmann almost makes it 1-0! The game has become an incredibly open one as both teams push hard for a goal. Griezmann cuts inside from the right wing and easily skips past his marker before trying to beat Ochoa at the near post, but he sends his shot into the side-netting after firing it just past the fingertips of the Mexican."
53',action,"Ramos goes close! The Atletico back line leave pockets of space available inside the penalty area, allowing Agbo to charge in unopposed. He flies towards the near post before cutting a lovely pass back to Ramos, but the Colombian sends his first-time shot straight into the hands of Oblak. He really should have found the back of the net with that!"
52',action,"A promising Atletico attacking move comes to an end deep down the right wing, and once again Granada hit the visitors on a quick counter-attack. It's Pereira who breaks forward on a great run as he weaves his way into the penalty area, but he's unable to beat Savic and has the ball poked away from his feet just as he looks set to shoot."
50',action,"Good save by Ochoa! The swinging cross from the set-piece is just about punched away by Ochoa, but he can only send the ball to Carrasco on the edge of the penalty area. The Belgian immediately unleashes a thumping, first-time strike, but the Granada goalkeeper gets down low to push it away from danger."
49',action,"Carrasco steps up and unleashes a shot from the free-kick, but it's poorly hit and fails to beat the wall camped in front of him. The ball then bounces out to the left wing and finds Gaitan, and he wins another free-kick for Atletico in a promising position after being bundled over from behind."
48',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Sverrir Ingi Ingason. Griezmann flies towards the Granada box on a marauding run before being pulled back by Ingason, who receives a yellow card for the cynical tug on the striker. The free-kick is in a great position just a few yards outside of the penalty area, but can Atletico make it count?"
47',action,"Early chance for Atletico! The visitors immediately break forward and do well to win themselves a corner over on the left wing. It's fired into the Granada penalty area and almost finds the head of Godin, but the ball sails just an inch or so over the head of the captain before he's penalised for a push on his marker."
46',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Thomas Teye Partey sub-in Ángel Martín Correa . Atletico have made one alteration during the half-time break, with Angel Correa coming on to replace Thomas."
46',action,We're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half.
,action,"It's been a frustrating evening for Atletico so far, as the visitors have struggled to create too many chances against a Granada side that have impressed at both ends of the pitch. They started the game the better of the two teams and went close to opening the scoring through Carrasco, but since then the hosts have come back into the contest and have arguably looked the brightest, with Hector and Pereira doing particularly well down the left wing."
,action,HALF-TIME: GRANADA 0-0 ATLETICO MADRID
45',action,"Wonderful defending by Ingason! Koke picks up possession the halfway line and immediately fires a lofted pass through the Granada defence and into the path of Griezmann. The Frenchman's first touch is good and looks set to allow him to shoot, but Ingason is there to dispossess the striker with a beautiful tackle from behind at the vital moment."
44',action,"Carrasco drifts out to the left wing and picks up the ball just outside of the Granada box. He then cuts inside and pokes a deft pass back to Gaitan, who is presented with a great chance to unleash a shot. He fails to do so quickly enough, however, and he's quickly dispossessed on the edge of the penalty area."
42',action,"Gaitan is sent spiralling into the air after being caught by a hefty sliding tackle from Saunier, resulting in a free-kick for Atletico in a dangerous position. It's curled into the heart of the penalty area and finds the head of Griezmann, and the Frenchman's glancing effort then bounces just wide of the far post after beating Ochoa."
40',action,"Carrasco, who started well but has seen little of the ball over the past 20 minutes, gets himself into a pocket of space deep down the right flank before firing a low cross into the Granada box. It fails to pick out a team-mate, however, and is easily thumped away by Gaston Silva."
38',action,"What a chance for Pereira! An attempted Atletico attack breaks down and Granada hit them on a quick counter. Pereira flies through the middle of the pitch and towards the visitors' penalty area before trying to tee up Ramos, but his pass across the box is poorly hit and rolls just behind the on-rushing striker."
37',action,"Nervy moments for Oblak! Hector is sent crashing to the ground over on the left wing, and Granada are presented with yet another opportunity to test the visitors. Wakaso steps up and swings in a dangerous cross-cum-shot that causes a few problems for Oblak, but the goalkeeper backtracks well before clawing the ball away from the goal."
36',action,"Pereira causes problems over on the left flank once again, and this time his cross into the box almost finds Ramos at the near post. It's just about dealt with by Savic, however, and the resulting corner is also well cleared by the under-pressure Atletico back line."
34',action,"Pereira battles hard with Juanfran over on the left wing as he out-muscles the full-back before winning the hosts a corner. It's fired in low towards the near post and momentarily bounces around dangerously, but Atletico are just about able to deal with the danger."
32',action,"A lofted pass forward finds Pereira, who does well to bring the ball down before spinning and finding Hector. The full-back charges down the left wing and then tries to pick out Ramos with a swinging cross over to the far post, but it's sent slightly too deep and fails to find the Colombian."
30',action,"Uche Agbo is pushed from behind and wins a free-kick for Granada that Wakaso curls into the penalty area and over to the far post. It's just about dealt with by the Atletico defenders and results in a corner for the home side, but they're unable to make it count and their opponents hold on once again."
28',action,"Vital interception by Hector! Luis cuts inside from the left wing on a great run before teeing up Thomas on the edge of the Granada penalty area. The midfielder then pokes a deft pass into the right-hand side of the box and towards Carrasco, but, just as he's about to reach the ball, the Belgian is dispossessed by a great sliding tackle from Hector."
26',action,"Hector has arguably been one of Granada's better players so far, and he's constantly doing well to find some space down the left flank. Once again, he breaks forward on a marauding run before taking on Juanfran, but it's the latter who comes out on top with a hefty tackle. It's slightly too hefty for the Granada full-back, who immediately complains to the referee after not being awarded a free-kick."
24',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Matthieu Saunier. Saunier crashes into the back of Gaitan deep down the left wing and earns himself a yellow card. The resulting free-kick is whipped into the penalty area and finds Stefan Savic in a great position in front of goal, but the centre-back sends his downward header just wide of the near post."
23',action,"An attempted Atletico attacking move comes to an end and presents Granada with a good opportunity to push forward quickly, but Thomas does well to close down the space quickly before winning the ball back for the visitors."
21',action,"Atletico win themselves a free-kick just inside their own half of the pitch and are able to get themselves back on the ball. They work it around nicely before Koke tries to test Ochoa from 25 yards out, but it's poorly hit and flies comfortably wide of the goal."
19',action,"Granada are doing really well at the moment, as it's they who are currently finding the most joy inside the final third. Once again, Hector looks bright in a forward position as he tries to cut towards the penalty area, but Atletico have enough bodies back and are eventually able to clear the danger."
17',action,"Almost lovely play by Boga! The Frenchman twists and turns as he weaves his way through a group of black shirts and towards the Atletico penalty area, but he lets himself down at the vital moment with a misplaced pass that rolls into the hands of Oblak."
16',action,"Chance for Ramos! Hector gets himself into a good position deep down the left wing before swinging a cross into the Atletico penalty area, and it ends up flying just past the foot of Jeremie Boga. Granada are able to keep the move alive, however, and quickly fire another cross right on to the head of Ramos, but the striker's effort on goal is well caught by Jan Oblak."
15',action,"Koke cuts inside from the left wing but is pulled back by Matthieu Saunier after beating the Frenchman, and Atletico are awarded a free-kick in a promising position. It's Koke who swings a cross into the box, but it's too deep and is easily punched away by Ochoa."
13',action,"Granada patiently pass the ball around inside the Atletico half of the pitch as they try to find a way through the three banks of black shirts camped in front of them. Mubarak Wakaso eventually tries to pick out a team-mate with a lofted pass forward, but it's overhit by the midfielder and sails out of play for a throw-in on the right flank."
11',action,"Carrasco, who has started brightly, causes problems for the Granada defence once again as he darts into the box with the ball at his feet, but he's unable to tee up Griezmann and has to settle for a corner. Koke's cross perfectly picks out Godin, but the centre-back pushes Sverrir Ingi Ingason in the build-up and is penalised straight away."
9',action,"Carrasco scores, but it's ruled out! The Belgian flies through the disjointed Granada back line as he charges into the box and latches on to a clever pass from Griezmann. He takes a few touches before slotting a low strike past Ochoa and into the back of the net, but the linesman's flag is raised for offside as soon as he makes contact with the ball."
8',action,"A thumping cross is fired into the heart of the Atletico penalty area and towards Adrian Ramos, but Diego Godin is easily able to cut out the danger. The ball bounces back out to the right wing and into the path of Dimitri Foulquier, but the Frenchman puts far too much power behind his follow-up effort and it sails comfortably out of play for a goal-kick."
6',action,"Inches away from Yannick Carrasco! Gaitan twists and turns over on the left-hand side of the Granada box before teeing up Filipe Luis. The Brazilian takes a quick look before curling a cross right on to the head of Carrasco, but his downward header fails to hit the target after leaving Guillermo Ochoa rooted to the spot."
4',action,"Andreas Pereira is caught by a flailing arm from Saul, resulting in a free-kick for Granada. It's sent short and worked over to Hector, who then bursts down the left flank on a great run. He initially beats one player before taking on Juanfran, but the Atletico full-back comes out on top with a hefty challenge that leaves Hector in a heap on the floor."
2',action,"Atletico immediately win the ball and fly forward on a blisteringly quick counter-attack, but, just as he's about to shoot from inside the penalty area, Antoine Griezmann has the ball poked away from his feet and out for a corner. The set-piece fails to result in a chance on goal, however, as Nicolas Gaitan's cross towards hte near post is a poor one."
1',action,"We're off! Granada get us underway, attacking from right to left."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."
,action,"Meanwhile, Atletico boss Diego Simeone has made three alterations to the team that featured in their last outing, with Sime Vrsaljko, Lucas Hernandez and Kevin Gameiro making way for Juanfran, Diego Godin and Nicolas Gaitan."
,action,"Lucas Alcaraz has decided to make five changes to the Granada side that started the defeat against Leganes last weekend, with Dimitri Foulquier, Matthieu Saunier, Gaston Silva, Jeremie Boga and Uche Agbo coming into the starting line-up to replace Isaac Cuenca, Ruben Vezo, David Lomban, Mehdi Carcela and Mubarak Wakaso, respectively."

,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this evening…"
,action,"A disappointing draw away to Deportivo dented Atletico’s chances of catching in-form Sevilla, but they followed the underwhelming result with a comfortable 3-0 victory at home to Valencia in their last outing. They will be looking to do the same today, especially after Sevilla were held to a 1-1 draw against Leganes earlier today."
,action,"October’s game at the Vicente Calderon was a particularly difficult one for Granada, who, despite going ahead through Isaac Cuenca in the 18th minute, were thrashed 7-1 by the hosts. The goal scored was their first against Atletico in almost exactly three years, with their opponents comfortably dominating this fixture in recent years."
,action,"With a game against fellow strugglers Sporting Gijon coming next week and a big clash away to Deportivo following soon after, any points gained from today’s contest could go a long way in Granada’s fight for survival. It’s not going to be easy, however, as they have only managed to avoid losing against Atletico on one occasion in the last 10 meetings between the two teams."
,action,"Despite still sitting inside the relegation zone, it’s been a positive few weeks for Granada, who have embarked on their best run of the season as they desperately try to claw their way out of the bottom three. Three wins from their last six games means that they now sit five points away from both 17th-place Deportivo La Coruna and 16th-place Leganes, but last weekend’s narrow defeat against the latter side was certainly a missed opportunity for Lucas Alcaraz’s men."
,action,Good evening and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s La Liga game between Granada and Atletico Madrid at the Estadio Nuevo Los Carmenes.
