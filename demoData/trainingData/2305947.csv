,action,"That's all for our live coverage, thanks for following along. Goodbye!"
,action,"Goals from Nikola Kalinic and Milan Badelj on either side of half-time provide the Viola with their first league win over the Bianconeri since 2013, blowing open the title race. In the end, it must be said that it's a deserved victory for Fiorentina, who were the better side from start to finish."
90'+6',action,FULL-TIME: FIORENTINA 2-1 JUVENTUS.
90'+4',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Paulo Bruno Dybala. Dybala is issued a yellow card, with Cristoforo the victim again. That's frustration from the striker, stemming from the missed chance shortly before it."
90'+3',action,"THAT SHOULD HAVE ICED IT! Superb throughball from Kalinic to play Ilicic through, and the substitute manages to round Buffon, but his final touch is too hard as it takes him to a difficult angle, before eventually running behind for a goal-kick!"
90'+2',action,"Into the second of six minutes of stoppage-time and it's Fiorentina who are on the front foot. The options are there for them to keep possession and run time off the clock, high up the pitch, but an audacious effort from Vecino drifts wide and gives possession straight back to Juventus."
90',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Nikola Kalinić. Kalinic works hard to win the ball back and keep it high up the pitch, but he's a bit over-agressive and it results in him being shown a yellow card."
89',action,"HE'S SKIED IT! Mandzukic lays the ball off brilliantly for Dybala, sending the Argentine forward in down the left channel. He bursts into the area and drives an effort at goal, but gets completely under it, as the shot sails over the bar! What a shocking miss that is from a player of such quality!"
88',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Leonardo Bonucci. Seconds later, Bonucci is booked."
88',action,"HE'S A LUCKY BOY! Chiellini lunges into the back of Kalinic and takes him to ground, in what looked a painful one for the striker. He's already on a yellow, but somehow escapes a second here! That could very well have resulted in a sending off."
86',action,"Juventus are struggling to keep the pressure concentrated in Fiorentina's end. There's just been too many stray passes and loose touches, and when they come, the hosts are so quick to pounce and start back the other way."
85',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Borja Valero Iglesias sub-in Josip Iličić . Josip Ilicic is the third and final player to come off the bench for Fiorentina, with Borja Valero giving way."
82',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Alex Sandro Lobo Silva. Alex Sandro goes into the referee's book for a foul high up the pitch on Cristoforo, but Juventus are turning on the style here."
81',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Federico Chiesa sub-in Cristian Tello Herrera . Fiorentina make their second change of the evening, with Cristian Tello replacing Chiesa."
80',action,"HOW HAS THIS STAYED OUT?! Higuain rises to get on the end of a free-kick, but Tatarusanu does well to close his legs to keep out the downward header. A mad scramble ensues as neither Kalinic nor Rodriguez can clear, before Chiellini's follow-up is again kept out off the line by Tatarusanu!"
79',substitution,Substitution sub-out Andrea Barzagli sub-in Mario Mandžukić . Juventus going all in here in their search for an equaliser. Mario Mandzukic replaces Barzagli for the final 10 minutes.
78',action,"It's Juventus who need a goal, but it's Fiorentina who are looking threatening. The hosts continue to put in excellent work all over the pitch as they show little to no signs of fading here. Just over 10 minutes to go though to see this one out."
77',substitution,Substitution sub-out Claudio Marchisio sub-in Tomás Eduardo Rincón Hernández . Juventus go to their bench for a second time and it's Tomas Rincon who comes on at the expense of Marchisio.
76',substitution,Substitution sub-out Federico Bernardeschi sub-in Sebastián Carlos Cristóforo Pepe . Fiorentina make their first change here as Sebastian Cristoforo replaces Bernardeschi.
73',action,"STAT: Juventus haven’t drawn any of their last 30 Serie A games, the third longest drawless streak in the top flight after Como’s 32 games (December 1950-October 1951) and Napoli’s 31 games (November 1930-October 1931)."
71',action,"This appears rather ominous for Chiesa, who is taken off on a stretcher. It didn't look very painful, though it was a bit reckless from Marchisio, who somehow managed to escape further discipline."
69',action,"Both the injured players are back on for Fiorentina, though there is activity on their touchline. And just as the rhythm starts to come back into the game, Chiesa goes down following a challenge from Marchisio, again prompting the training staff to come out onto the pitch."
67',action,"Play comes to a halt as Kalinic goes down injured. It looks like he over-extended himself a bit when lunging for the ball, and it comes just a minute after an injury stoppage for Badelj, who took a ball to the face off the foot of Chiellini."
65',action,Fiorentina continue to cause all sorts of problems for Juventus with their high pressing. The question remains though whether or not they can keep this intensity up through 90 minutes. Fatigue surely has to become an issue at one point or another.
63',action,"The tension inside the stadium is palpable. The match is delicately poised into the final 30 minutes and there's just no way really to know which way it's going to go. Juventus are in the ascendency, but it's proving to be a slow process."
61',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Stefano Sturaro sub-in Marko Pjaca . A first change of the night for Juventus sees sub-in Marko Pjaca replace Sturaro. Interesting swap, this."
60',action,"STAT: Gonzalo Higuaín has found the net in five of his last six Serie A appearances against Fiorentina, including each of the last four (including today)."
58',assist,"Assist Stefano Sturaro. Sturaro records the assist, with a slice of good fortune."
58',goal,Goal Gonzalo Gerardo Higuaín. THEY'RE RIGHT BACK IN IT! Higuain is on hand to pounce with a scrappy finish after Khedira's cross came through to him off Sturaro! Game on!
56',action,"Frustration is building for Juventus. They're at a loss right now and in desperate need of a jolt. They're far too lethargic tonight, and perhaps Allegri will be podering a change or two before it's too late."
54',assist,Assist Maximiliano Martín Olivera De Andrea. Olivera is credited with the assist.
54',goal,"Goal Milan Badelj. FIORENTINA DOUBLE THEIR LEAD! Incredible scenes in Florence! Badelj floats a terrific ball in over the top and Chiesa gets goalside of Alex Sandro, which throws off Buffon, allowing the initial delivery to run all the way through and in at the far post!"
53',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Federico Chiesa. Chiesa becomes the fourth player booked on the night, the second for Fiorentina."
52',action,"STAT: Fiorentina are unbeaten at home this season, and are also the side to have drawn the most games on home soil (five)."
50',action,"BUFFON TO THE RESCUE! Again the keeper bails his side out, getting down to prevent Kalinic from rolling a shot under him at the near post, following some good play from Sanchez in the build-up! Bernardeschi was open in the centre there if the striker could have rolled a pass through."
48',action,"Fiorentina pick up where they left off, controlling the tempo and taking the game to Juventus. Olivera whips in a delicious cross from the left flank which Bernardeschi meets, but the attacker's first-touch is heavy and Buffon is able to deal with it."
46',action,Here we go again!
,action,"Nikola Kalinic has the hosts deservedly on top of the league leaders through 45 minutes. Fiorentina stormed out of the gate with a determination and intensity that Juventus have yet to match, and they trail because of it. Perfectly poised for the second half in Florence."
45'+1',action,HALF-TIME: FIORENTINA 1-0 JUVENTUS.
45',action,There will be one minute added on at the end of the first half.
44',action,"IT SHOULD BE IN! Last-ditch defending there from Fiorentina and it's Olivera who keeps out Higuain's strike from close range out of pure desperation, after the ball fell kindly for the striker inside the area! That was the best look of the half for Juventus and it comes just a minute before the interval!"
41',action,"There's a great desire in this Fiorentina side, even more so now that they have the lead. Juventus are going to have to collect themselves at the interval and change their approach if they are to find a way back into this game."
39',action,STAT: Fiorentina had failed to score in four of their last six home encounters against Juventus in the league coming into tonight.
37',assist,Assist Federico Bernardeschi. Bernardeschi provides the assist.
37',goal,"Goal Nikola Kalinić. FIORENTINA HAVE THE BREAKTHROUGH! Kalinic starts the move with a wonderfully cushioned header for Bernardeschi, who returns the favour by playing the striker through on the right, and Kalinic makes no mistake, driving an accomplished finish into the far corner!"
35',action,"The match has become very stop and start now, as the fouls continue to accumulate. It's very much on a knife's edge here, but has made for some decent viewing from a neutral perspective. You have to admire the compete in these players."
33',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Giorgio Chiellini. A third yellow card in quick succession here, this one shown to Chiellini, as he trips up Chiesa from behind to halt a break."
31',action,"Juventus have done well to weather the storm and are growing in stature as we pass the half-hour mark. That being said, their attacking influence has still been surprisingly limited, with Fiorentina remaining sharper in possession."
29',yellow-card,Yellow Card Matías Vecino Falero. The intensity is ramped up in a big way here as the tackles come flying in. Vecino is shown the second yellow in three minutes for a dangerous tackle on Dybala just shy of the halfway line.
26',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Stefano Sturaro. The stadium erupted two minutes ago for Sturaro to be issued a yellow for a foul, but the referee showed mercy. Well, the Juventus midfielder is at it again here, this time sliding in with two feet on Bernardeschi, and the referee's patience has worn thin. It's a booking for Sturaro."
25',action,"Valero's cross in from the left proves a tricky one to deal with, deflecting off Chiellini and ricocheting back towards the Juventus goal. Kalinic aims to pounce, but Buffon steps up in a hurry to collect. Smart piece of goalkeeping, that."
23',action,"STAT: Juventus have conceded goals in each of their last four away games in the league, but they haven’t shipped goals in five in a row since March 2013."
21',action,"Refreshingly positive and direct running from Alex Sandro has Juventus threatening for the first time, forcing Chiesa to tug back on his shirt, conceding a free-kick. The ensuing delivery leads to a corner, of which results in a tame shot on goal from Sandro - the first of the match for the league leaders."
19',action,"It's not often Juventus struggle this much to string passes together, but that's been the case here. Once they cross the halfway line, they're really finding it difficult to keep the ball. Tatarusanu has yet to be called into action."
17',action,"There's a great intensity to the match, especially in midfield, where every inch is being fought for. Fiorentina are pressing high up when they're not in possession, and Juventus have been unable to match their energy."
15',action,This has been an excellent display from the hosts through a quarter of an hour. They're keeping well-organised and remain incisive in possession as they continue their pursuit of the opening goal. Juventus have created precious little thus far.
13',action,"STAT: Fiorentina have won only one of their last 17 Serie A clashes against Juventus, coming at home in October 2013 via a 4-2 scoreline (6D, 10L)."
11',action,"NEARLY THE OPENER! Good hold-up play from Kalinic in the area allows for support to arrive in the form of Vecino. The midfielder's initial shot deflects off Khedira and kindly back into his path. He takes two steps towards goal and tries to power an effort in at the near post, but it smacks off the outside of the woodwork and goes behind!"
9',action,"Meanwhile, play comes to a halt moments after the Buffon save with Bonucci down and in need of attention. It didn't look like much of a coming together, but you can never be too careful with a head injury. He walks off on his own power and should be fine to continue."
7',action,GREAT SAVE! There doesn't appear to be any rust on Buffon in his return to action. The seas part for Vecino as he surges forward through the centre and drives a strike toward the far post. Buffon reads it well and gets down in a flash to parry.
5',action,"One for the cameras! Ciprian Tatarusanu makes an acrobatic save, flying through the air to tip Higuain's effort over the bar, though the play had long been whistled dead for offside as the Argentine failed to time his run accordingly."
3',action,"Fiorentina make an encouraging start to the match, enjoying plenty of time on the ball as they take the game to the leaders - though they've yet to negotiate much of an opening thus far."
1',action,"AND THEY'RE OFF! Fiorentina, in their distinctly purple strip, get the match underway, attacking right to left."
,action,"Juan Cuadrado and Alex Sandro will man the flanks, suggesting an attack-minded side from the Bianconeri. Gonzalo Higuain is selected to partner Dybala up top, ahead of Mario Mandzukic, who put in a stellar performance on Wednesday night in Turin."
,action,"Massimiliano Allegri has rotated his squad almost completely, following their entertaining 3-2 victory over Atalanta in the cup. Andrea Barzagli, Claudio Matchisio and Paulo Dybala are the lone trio to keep their place. Gianluigi Buffon returns for his first action of 2017, while Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini are brought into the three-man defence alongside Barzagli."
,action,"Paulo Sousa makes three changes to the side which dumped Chievo from the Coppa Italia on Wednesday, with two of them coming in defence, as Gonzalo Rodriguez and Davide Astori replace Nenad Tomovic and Sebastian De Maio. The other comes up top, where Borja Valero is restored to the attacking trident, at the expense of Mauro Zarate."
,action,"SUBS: Pjanic, Hernanes, Mandzukic, Pjaca, Asamoah, Rugani, Neto, Rincon, Audero."
,action,"JUVENTUS (3-5-2): Buffon; Barzagli, Bonucci, Chiellini; Cuadrado, Khedira, Marchisio, Sturaro, Sandro; Dybala, Higuain."
,action,"SUBS: Sportiello, Lezzerini, De Maio, Zarate, Tello, Salcedo, Cristoforo, Hagi, Babacar, Milic, Tomovic, Ilicic."
,action,"FIORENTINA (3-4-3): Tatarusanu; Sanchez, Rodriguez, Astori; Chiesa, Vecino, Badelj, Olivera; Valero, Bernardeschi, Kalinic."
,action,CONFIRMED TEAM NEWS:
,action,"Massimiliano Allegri’s side lead Roma (who won earlier today) by just one point at the top, though they have played two fewer matches. Still, should they slip up tonight, the title race will be very much on."
,action,"On the contrary, Juventus have yet to draw a league match this campaign. They have opened 2017 with successive victories, but face their first road test of the year, and it promises to be a tricky one to navigate."
,action,"Turn a few of those into victories, and they still would be in with a realistic shot of competing for a top-five finish. They still have an outside chance, but enter tonight’s match nine-points back of fifth and 13 back of fourth."
,action,"Fiorentina have proven themselves a hard team to beat, especially at home, but their problem resides in the fact that they draw too many matches. No other Serie A team has drawn more matches than them this season."
,action,Hello and welcome to live coverage from the Stadio Artemio Franchi where Fiorentina aim to slow down the league leaders when they host Juventus!
