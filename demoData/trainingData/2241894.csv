85',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Mame Biram Diouf. Another Stoke player goes into the book, this time it is Diouf for a late tackle."
83',action,GREAT SAVE! BURNLEY GO CLOSE! That was Burnley best chance of the game to score. Hendrick does brilliantly to flick the ball onto Gray who then fires a shot at goal which Grant tips wide with his fingertips. More of this is needed by Burnley as we enter the final minutes of the game.
81',substitution,Substitution sub-out Jon Flanagan sub-in James Tarkowski . sub-in James Tarkowski replaces Flanagan at right-back.
80',action,STOKE CHANCE! The Potters almost have a third goal here.

77',substitution,"Substitution sub-out George Boyd sub-in Sam Vokes . sub-in Sam Vokes replaces Boyd, giving Burnley more of an aerial threat."
75',action,"Much better from Burnley in this second half but they're lacking that final ball to create any clear-cut opportunities. Grant has hardly had a save to make, despite the Burnley possession."
73',action,"Walters has moved over to the left wing now that Crouch as come onto the pitch, and he is already causing Flanagan problems."
71',substitution,Substitution sub-out Marko Arnautović sub-in Peter Crouch . Second Stoke substitution of the game sees Arnautović come off and is replaced by sub-in Peter Crouch.
70',yellow-card,Yellow Card Gilbert Gianelli Imbula Wanga. Imbula goes into the book for tripping Hendrick's heels.
67',action,"CHANCE STOKE! Joe Allen with a great opportunity to make it 3-0 Stoke. It was almost a replica of Muniesa's goal, with Arnautovic beating Flanagan and pulling the ball back, this time it is Allen on the end of the ball, but his strike it straight at Robinson."
66',action,"Burnley certainly haven't given up hope in this one, but they need to start stretching the Stoke defence if they're to end their losing run."
65',action,Another Burnley corner! This time Mee gets his head to it under heavy pressure and he can only direct the ball over the bar.
63',action,Martins Indi is down for Stoke at the moment and is receiving medical treatment after appearing to collide with Barnes elbow as the two players attempted to head the ball. Barnes is lucky the referee didn't get a better view of that clash.

59',action,Hendrick is receiving a long talking too from the referee after he blatantly pulled back Walters on the half-way line. The Irish international was booked early in the first half and needs to be careful now.

55',action,"Arfield takes the free-kick but it is deflected wide by the wall, the resulting corner is then easily gathered by Grant and the danger is cleared."

54',action,"CHANCE BURNLEY! Munisea brought down Gray right on the edge of the box after a long tussle between the two players, with both players having ahold of eachothers shirts. The referee awards a free-kick to Burnley in a good position, however the visitors are still appealing for a red card to be given to Muniesa, as Gray was almost through on goal."
52',action,"Despite all of the possession, Burnley aren't creating any goal-scoring opportunities and Stoke's defence are dealing with the Clarets threat."
50',action,"The visitors are enjoying the early possession of the ball just as they did in the opening minutes of the first-half, however can they make all of their domination count?"
48',action,"A positive start from Burnley, the two full-backs are pushing high up the pitch but they will need to be careful that they don't get caught on the counter-attack."
47',action,"The Clarets have once again started the half the better team, trying to get at Stoke straight away. Barnes tried his luck from the edge of the box and almost caught Grant off-guard, however the Stoke keeper did well to tip the shot over the bar."
46',action,Here we go! Stoke get the second half underway.
,action,The teams are back out on the pitch ahead of the second half. Will Stoke continue to dominate or will Burnley force their way back into the game?
,action,"Stoke very much in the driving seat here at the bet365 Stadium. Despite a good start from Burnley, they could'nt capitalise on their fast start and the Potters quickly grew into the game.

42',action,"Corner to Burnley! Barnes put pressure on Muniesa eventually won a corner, the first opportunity for the visitors in a while."
41',action,"Burnley are struggling to keep a lid of Stoke at the moment, the hosts are dominating proceedings and the Clarets face a tough task to get back into this game."

35',goal,"Goal Marc Muniesa Martínez. TWO-NIL! The centre-back Marc Muniesa started this attack and then finished it with a superb finish past Robinson to double Stoke's lead! That's his first ever Premier League goal and it was a very good team goal. Muniesa won the ball deep in his own half and played the ball to Shaqiri who then linked up well with Arnautovic, who put it on a plate for Stoke centre-half who was completly unmarked."
32',action,STAT: Walters goal today was his 40th Premier League goal for Stoke City; more than any other Potters' player in the competition.

28',action,"CHANCE STOKE! This time it is Arnautovic causing the Burnley defence problems. He uses his pace and tricky to work an opportunity in the box, but it is well blocked by the Burnley skipper Ben Mee."
25',action,Stoke are starting to increase the pace of this game and look the most likely to score again! Shaqiri and Marko Arnautovic are causing the Clarets defence numerous problems.

20',goal,Goal Jonathan Walters. STOKE OPEN THE SCORING! Jon Walters with a stunning finish to give the Potters the lead here at the bet365 Stadium. It was a great low cross into the box by Diouf and Walters produced a fantastic finish which looped over Robinson and into the far corner of the net. Walters could've taken a touch but instead guided the ball over Robinson with a great touch. Stoke lead!
19',action,STAT: Burnley have scored just five goals in their last 14 Premier League matches on the road and never more than once in a game in this run.

14',yellow-card,Yellow Card Jeff Hendrick. First yellow card of the game goes to Jeff Hendrick for a poor tackle on Charlie Adam. Mark Clattenburg had no hesitation in producing the card.
14',action,"Burnley are trying to get high balls into Barnes, to flick on for the pacy Gray, but striker is getting caught offside time and time again, through Stoke's high-line."
12',action,"The Potters have settled into this game now, they look far more composed and confident on the ball which is a great sight for their supporters."
10',action,"OFF THE POST! Stoke's first real attack sees the best chance of the game so far! Bruno Martins Indi had far too much space in the box from a Shaqiri corner but he can only direct his header onto the post, with Arfield and Paul Robinson nowhere near it. That should've gone in!"
8',action,"Terrific tempo in this game by Burnley, they are pressing Stoke high up the field and limiting their options when the Potters do get on the ball. Good start from the visitors."
6',action,BARNES OFFSIDE! What a chance to open the scoring for Burnley. The visitors break well and Gray's through ball to Barnes under-pressure is perfect and the striker is clear on goal. However the Clarets forward made his run too early and he is rightly called offside.
4',action,"Burnley are enjoying possession of the ball at the moment, they look pretty comfortable with the ball and are their midfield are linking up well with Gray and Barnes. With the latter using his height and power to good effect."
2',action,"Arfield takes the free-kick but the Stoke wall does its job and the ball goes out for a corner, which cleared well by Stoke. Bright start by the visitors, Barnes and Andre Gray causing the Stoke defence problems already."
1',action,"Burnley win a free-kick in a dangerous position straight from kick-off, as Charlie Adam brought down Ashley Barnes. The set piece is around 25 yards from goal and it looks like it will be Scott Arfield or George Boyd to take. Great chance for the visitors!"
1',action,We're underway!
,action,"The teams are out here at the bet365 Stadium, kick-off is almost upon us. Stay tuned for all of the match action here between Stoke City and Burnley in the Premier League."

,action,"TEAM NEWS: As expected Stoke boss Mark Hughes sticks with the starting line-up that secured a 1-0 win at Watford last weekend, however Joe Allen and Glenn Whelan return to the bench. Whilst Burnley make four changes as the Clarets look for their first away win of the season. Jon Flanagan, Scott Arfield, Andre Gray and Ashley Barnes all start at the bet365 Stadium."

,action,CONFIRMED TEAM NEWS...
,action,"Tom Heaton is a huge doubt for Burnley as they look to improve their poor Premier League away form today against Stoke. The Clarets, who have won just one point on the road in the Premier League this season, are likely to turn to Paul Robinson for the second successive game as Heaton is rated as ""touch and go"" by manager Sean Dyche. Johann Berg Gudmundsson is out for Burnley with a hamstring injury, but Dean Marney could be back in the side today after overcoming injury."
,action,"Joe Allen is likely to return to the Stoke squad after suspension, while Glenn Whelan should be fit after missing last weekend's win over Watford with a calf injury. However the Potters captain Ryan Shawcross remains a doubt with a calf injury and knee injuries keep Geoff Cameron and Phil Bardsley sidelined."
,action,"Stoke's bet365 Stadium was the site of Burnley's first away victory in their top-flight campaign two years ago. The Potters have been in good form lately, winning four of their last six matches, including last time out against Watford, to climb the table to 11th after a poor start to the season. Meanwhile their opponents today Burnley have lost their last two games, including a 4-0 thrashing away at West Brom, and they sit 13th in the Premier League table."
