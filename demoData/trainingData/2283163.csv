90'+1',action,We’re into two minutes of added time and Gaitan should make it 4-0 as he skips past Garay before blasting the ball high over the bar from just six yards out.
89',action,"Thomas has looked really good since coming on and he plays the ball into the path of Gaitan down the left-hand edge of the penalty box, but Mangala does well to get across and block the winger’s cross."
87',action,"Thomas does well to regain possession for Atletico inside his own half with a strong tackle and he releases Correa out wide on the left, but the striker has no support in the middle and holds the ball up before rolling it back towards halfway and the attacking chance passes."
85',substitution,Substitution sub-out Antoine Griezmann sub-in Ángel Martín Correa . Griezmann gets a standing ovation now and walks off with a big smile on his face as he’s replaced by Angel Correa.
83',goal,"Goal Antoine Griezmann. GOOOAAAALLLLLLL!!!! Gaitan fires a low pass in towards Thomas and the midfielder sticks a toe on the ball looking to control it, but ends up turning the ball into the path of Griezmann, who pokes it past Alves from eight yards out to all but seal the three points for Atletico."
83',assist,Assist Thomas Teye Partey. It didn't look like that was an intended pass from Thomas but it was certainly effective.
82',action,"Atletico look to have switched to a 4-5-1 formation since those substitutions with Griezmann playing as the lone striker, and they’re in complete control of the game at the moment."
80',action,"Valencia win a free-kick on the right-hand corner of the Atletico penalty box after a foul on Bakkali. Parejo swings in a dangerous cross towards the back post, but the referee awards the home side a free-kick after a push from Mangala."
78',action,"Saul rolls the ball into the path of Griezmann, who has acres of space to shoot 25 yards out from goal, but his low, well struck effort is straight at Alves, who gathers it in with ease."

75',action,"Lovely skill from Cancelo gets him away into space down the right, but he only has Zaza in the middle to aim for and the cross is too deep, allowing Vrsaljko to cushion a header back into the arms of Oblak at the far post."
73',action,"Santi Mina chests the ball brilliantly into the feet of Zaza 15 yards out from goal, but Lucas gets across well just as the striker looks to shoot on the turn and takes the sting out of the left-footed effort, making it easy for Oblak to claim low to his right."
71',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Kevin Gameiro sub-in Osvaldo Nicolás Fabián Gaitán . A first change for Atletico now as Gameiro, scorer of the second goal, is replaced by Nicolas Gaitan."
70',action,"Yet another woeful pass from Cancelo goes straight to Griezmann on the edge of the box, but just as with Gameiro moments earlier, he can only hit his left-footed effort wide of the far post. Another let off for Valencia!"
69',action,"Another dreadful back pass, this time from the substitute Bakkali, plays Gameiro clean through on goal once again, but Mangala gets back well to force the Frenchman out wide and he drags his shot wide of the far post."
67',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Munir El Haddadi Mohamed sub-in Santiago Mina Lorenzo . And it’s going to be a double change for the visitors, with Santi Mina replacing Munir as well."

66',action,"Savic fails to clear Gaya’s low cross properly and Cancelo gets an opportunity to put another cross in from the right, but it’s a poor one and Lucas is able to comfortably head clear at the near post."
64',action,This game really has lost all its intensity now as Garay stands with the ball at his feet for a number of seconds before deciding what to do with it as the Atletico players just stand off him.
62',action,Atletico are quite happy to knock the ball around in the middle of the park now with this two goal lead with the two centre-halves and Gabi seeing plenty of the ball.
60',action,Fabian Orellana picks out Munir on the edge of the Atletico penalty box but he’s completely surrounded by defenders and loses possession cheaply. Valencia are really struggling to get a sight of goal here.
58',action,"What a tackle from Mangala!! Gameiro looks to be clean through on goal after an awful back-pass from Perez, but the ball just won’t sit down for him to shoot and the centre-back makes a superb last-ditch sliding tackle to take the ball away from him."
55',action,"Close! Munir picks the ball up 45 yards out from goal and seeing Oblak off his line he goes for goal, and the Atletico goalkeeper has to backpedal quickly to turn the ball around the post."
54',action,"What a save from Alves!!! Griezmann is played clean through on goal by a lovely pass from Koke, but Alves anticipates which way the striker is going to go and gets down really well to his right to turn the ball around the post."
51',action,"Valencia are just starting to enjoy a good little spell of possession now, but they’re struggling to create anything meaningful and Atletico look pretty comfortable without the ball."

48',goal,"Goal Kevin Gameiro. GOOOAAALLLLLL!!!! Gameiro doubles Atletico’s lead!! Filipe Luis rolls the ball across the top of the box towards Gameiro, and the striker’s low effort from 12 yards out deflects off a sliding Mangala and over Alves into the back of the net."
46',action,"Kick-off! Valencia get the second half underway, looking to get themselves back into this game."
,action,"Valencia have had one good opportunity when Zaza headed wide from a free-kick, but in open play they’ve struggled to threaten Oblak’s goal, and Voro will be looking for his midfield three to get forward in support of Zaza more often in the second half."
,action,"Atletico lead at the break at the Vicente Calderon thanks to Griezmann’s early goal, which was far too simple from a Valencia point of view. Neither side have really got going in the game though in truth, although Atletico have looked dangerous on the counter-attack, particularly down the right hand side through Carrasco and Vrsaljko."
,action,Half-time: Atletico Madrid 1-0 Valencia
44',action,"Atletico break forward at pace once again and Gameiro has plenty of options with the ball at his feet on the right-hand corner of the penalty box, but the Frenchman attempts a curled cross into the middle, but only succeeds in chipping the ball into Alves’s grateful arms."
42',action,Things just getting a little bit scrappy now as first Felipe Luis gives the ball away for Atletico before Carlos Soler does the same for Valencia. You sense both sides are playing for half time now.
40',action,"Vrsaljko is enjoying an awful lot of space down the right-hand side at the moment, this time he gets forward and looks to pick out Gameiro and Griezmann is the middle with a low cross, but once again Garay is there to intercept it. The centre-back has certainly been busy in the half so far."
38',action,"The ball breaks off the referee’s legs and straight into the path of Filipe Luis who has plenty of support ahead of him, but he can’t make the most of the opportunity and Valencia regain possession through Garay. You suspect referee Estrada Fernandez will breathe a huge sigh of relief at the outcome of that passage of play."
36',action,"Carrasco and Vrsaljko link up well once again down the right and the full-back whips a good cross in to the middle where Koke is arriving late, but he doesn’t get enough on the header and it skims off the top of his head across the face of goal and out for a goal kick."
34',action,"A half-chance for Zaza as he attacks Gaya’s cross from the left but doesn’t get a clean connection on his header, miscuing it back towards where it came from and out for a goal kick."
32',action,"Zaza gets away down the right-hand side but has very little in the way of support, and Filipe Luis makes a really good tackle before working the ball nicely out from close to the corner flag with a smart exchange of passes with Lucas Hernandez."
30',yellow-card,Yellow Card Yannick Ferreira Carrasco. Carrasco goes into the book for an apparent elbow in the face of Perez. It looked a little harsh as it was more of a hand to the face and Perez certainly made the most of it.
29',action,"Close! Vrsaljko whips in a superb low cross from the right-hand side after Mangala had given the ball away with a poor clearance, and Gameiro attacks the cross and attempts an audacious flick at the near post, but can only turn the ball well wide of Alves’s goal."
26',action,"Chance for Valencia! Daniel Parejo floats in a free-kick from a central area towards Simone Zaza at the far post, but having got up well the striker can only head wide from six yards out. That’s the best chance of the game for Valencia so far."
24',action,"Wonderful one-touch football from Atletico involving Griezmann and Carrasco frees the latter up in space on the right, but his wonderful cross is just headed clear by Garay on the edge of the six yard box with Gameiro waiting to head it in behind him."
22',action,"Griezmann steals possession away from Perez with a good tackle inside the Atletico half and Carrasco has the chance to break forward at pace, but his through ball for Gameiro to chase is just too far ahead of the striker and Eliaquim Mangala is able to get across and clear the danger."
20',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Enzo Nicolás Pérez. Carrasco is brought down by Enzo Perez and although the referee plays advantage as Vrsaljko has possession on the right-hand side, he goes back to book the Valencia captain once play has stopped."
18',action,"Gabi picks out Sime Vrsaljko in acres of space on the right-hand corner of the penalty box with a lovely cross-field pass, but the offside flag goes up against the right-back and Valencia escape once again."
16',action,"Ezequiel Garay gives the ball away cheaply close to halfway with a loose pass, but fortunately for the centre-back Griezmann is flagged for offside as he retreats to receive a pass."
14',action,Valencia are really struggling to get out of their own half for any length of time here and they’re having to do a lot of defending.
12',action,"It’s all Atletico here as Griezmann skips past Joao Canelo with ease in the middle of the pitch before driving towards the Valencia penalty box, but his 20-yard effort this time flies high and wide of Alves’s goal."
10',assist,Assist Jorge Resurrección Merodio. Koke with the assist for the goal as he slips a simple pass through for Griezmann to chase as the Valencia defence just back right off him.
10',goal,Goal Antoine Griezmann. GOOOOOAAAALLLLLL!!! Griezmann gives Atletico the lead!! Koke slips the ball in behind the Valencia defence and Griezmann runs onto it and drills it low past Alves into the bottom corner from 12 yards out. That seemed awfully simple for Atletico.
8',action,Kevin Gameiro looks to pick out Carrasco with a chipped ball out wide to the right but it has too much pace on it for the Belgian and Valencia will have the throw. It looks as though Atletico are going to get the ball wide to Carrasco as often as possible here though.
5',action,Atletico have made a really good start here and Valencia are struggling to get on the ball at the moment. The home fans are certainly getting behind their side too.
3',action,"A half chance for Atletico as Diego Alves palms a long-range effort from Felipe Luis into a dangerous area, and the ball falls at the feet Carrasco who pulls the ball back towards Griezmann in the middle, the ball is just  behind the striker and Valencia are able to get the block in as he shoots on the turn."
1',action,"A positive start from Atletico as Yannick Carrasco gets down the right-hand edge of the box and looks to pick out Antoine Griezmann in the middle with a low cross, but Valencia are back in numbers and able to easily clear."
1',action,Kick-off! Atletico get the game underway.
,action,The players are making their way out onto the pitch. Kick-off is just moments away now.
,action,"Antoine Griezmann and Kevin Gameiro scored second half goals to help Atletico to a 2-0 win when the two sides met earlier in the season at the Mestalla, and the two French forwards may well be the biggest threat to Voro Gonzalez’s side today, having scored 19 La Liga goals between them this season"
,action,"Valencia make just one change from their side that beat Leganes, with Fabian Orellana replacing Zakaria Bakkali on the wing."

,action,"That run of wins has included impressive victories over Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid, before beating Leganes 1-0 in their last outing, with Eliaquim Mangala’s first-half goal enough to seal all three points."
,action,"Valencia meanwhile endured a difficult start to the campaign, winning just three of their first thirteen games, however their form has significantly improved of late under interim manager Voro Gonzalez, with three wins from their last four games moving them up to 13th in the table, ten points clear of the relegation zone."
,action,"Real Sociedad’s 3-2 win over Real Betis on Friday has left Atletico in fifth place in the league table, although they will move back into fourth with a win today, and Diego Simeone will certainly be concerned with his side’s defensive frailties, having conceded 22 league goals already this campaign, as opposed to just 18 in the whole of last season."
,action,"Atletico come into the game on the back of a 1-1 draw with Deportivo La Coruna, a game which was overshadowed by a nasty head injury to Atletico striker Fernando Torres in the second half."
