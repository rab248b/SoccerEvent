,action,"What a win that was for Dortmund! The home side were brilliant from start to finish, but by the end of the game they were tearing Leverkusen apart every time they pushed forward. After starting the second half brightly the visitors seemed to fall apart as soon as they went 4-2 down, and from then onwards they never looked like getting back into the game."
,action,FULL-TIME: BORUSSIA DORTMUND 6-2 BAYER LEVERKUSEN
90'+2',assist,"Assist Christian Pulisic. Pulisic did well to pick out Guerreiro under pressure, but, once again, Leverkusen's defending was atrocious. They've been all over the place since the fourth goal and have been torn apart by Dortmund's impressive front line."
90'+2',goal,"Goal Raphaël Adelino José Guerreiro. GOAL! It's six for Dortmund! The Leverkusen defence are caught all over the place inside their own penalty area, allowing Pulisic to poke the ball over to Guerreiro, who, completely unmarked, then fires a low shot past Leno and into the bottom right-hand corner of the net."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be three minutes of added time.
89',action,"Schurrle breaks through the disjointed Leverkusen back line and looks set to go one-on-one with Leno, but just as he's about to take on the goalkeeper, the linesman's flag is eventually raised for offside."
88',action,"Leverkusen, who have barely troubled Burki over the past 20 minutes, push forward from the restart before firing a looping cross into the heart of the penalty area, but it fails to find Hernandez in front of goal and is easily dealt with by the home side."
86',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Ömer Toprak sub-in Aleksandar Dragović . Leverkusen have made a late substitution, with Aleksandar Dragovic coming on to replace Toprak."
85',penalty-goal,Penalty Goal André Schürrle. GOAL! Leno is able to get a hand to the ball but can't keep Schurrle's thumping strike from finding the back of the net. Yet more misery for Roger Schmidt's men!
84',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Wendell Nascimento Borges. PENALTY! Schurrle makes an immediate impact as he bursts into the penalty area on a great run before being sandwiched between both Toprak and Wendell, leaving the referee with no choice but to point to the spot."
83',action,"It's all Dortmund at the moment as they continue putting pressure on the Leverkusen back line. The visitors seem to be lacking any sort of belief since conceding for the fourth time, and they're sleepwalking to yet another defeat."

77',assist,"Assist Erik Durm. Durm did well to skip past his marker and into the box before setting up Pulisic, but the latter played a hand in every part of that goal, as it was he who muscled his way through a group of red shirts before working the ball over to the wing-back."
77',goal,"Goal Christian Pulisic. GOAL! Another for Dortmund! Durm breaks down the right wing and into the Leverkusen penalty area before cutting the ball back to Pulisic, who after starting it in the middle of the pitch, ends up finishing the attack with a lovely strike that easily beats Leno."
76',action,"Bartra powers forward and gets himself into a good position 30 yards away from the Leverkusen goal. He's left in a pocket of space by the visitors and decides to try and test Leno from long range, but his effort ends up flying a few yards wide of its intended target."
74',goal,"Goal Wendell Nascimento Borges. GOAL! What a strike by Wendell! Bartra commits a poor challenge just outside of the Dortmund box, presenting Leverkusen with a free-kick in a very dangerous position. Wendell steps up and unleashes a wonderful shot that curls past the outstretched fingertips of Burki and into the top right-hand corner of the net. That was unstoppable!"

71',action,"Dortmund quickly win the ball back from the restart as they try to hit Leverkusen on another determined attacking move. The visitors have looked far more dangerous since the break than they did before it, but Dortmund have done well to come back over the past 10 minutes and have continuously put their opponents under plenty of pressure."
69',assist,"Assist Ousmane Dembélé. That was a lovely first-time cross by Dembele to pick out Aubameyang in front of goal, but Bender really should have done better. He seemed unaware that Aubameyang was standing behind him and wasn't quick enough to sort his feet out when the cross was fired towards him."
69',goal,"Goal Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. GOAL! Dortmund have reclaimed their two-goal cushion! The cross from the free-kick is a dangerous one, despite Havertz managing to get a head to it.

69',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Lars Bender. Dembele sprints through the middle of the pitch on a wonderful run as he easily skips past Bender, but the Leverkusen midfielder cynically drags the Frenchman to the ground from behind and concedes a free-kick in a dangerous position before receiving a yellow card."
67',action,"Chance for Pulisic! The American is really enjoying himself at the moment, and he seems to be Dortmund's biggest threat. Once again, he causes problems for the Leverkusen back line with a clever run forward, and this time he's able to test Leno with a low shot that the goalkeeper does well to tip round the near post."

54',action,"Once again, Aubameyang causes problems as he charges into the left-hand side of the Leverkusen penalty area. He then does well to tee up Pulisic in a pocket of space, but the American's attempted low cross is just about cleared by the visitors' defence."

48',goal,"Goal Kevin Volland. GOAL! Leverkusen have pulled one back! Wendell breaks into the Dortmund half of the pitch before threading a lovely pass through to Volland.

,action,"Bar the injury to Reus, it was a near-perfect opening 45 minutes for Dortmund, who comfortably looked the better of the two teams and deservedly head into the half-time break with a two-goal lead. Leverkusen have looked leaky at the back and have struggled to deal with the pace and trickery of Aubameyang and, in particular, Dembele, both of whom have impressed with the ball at their feet in and around the visitors' penalty area."

38',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Charles Mariano Aránguiz Sandoval sub-in Karim Bellarabi . Roger Schmidt clearly isn't happy with what he's seen so far, and he's decided to bring on sub-in Karim Bellarabi to replace Aranguiz with seven minutes of the first half still to play."
37',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Kai Havertz. Leverkusen pile bodies towards the right-hand side of the Dortmund penalty area, but Guerreiro gets in the way of Volland and denies him a way towards goal.

36',action,"Mehmedi is fouled over on the left wing and wins a free-kick for Leverkusen, which is curled into the heart of the penalty area by Havertz.

How did he miss that?"

,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"Leverkusen were victorious in October’s meeting at the BayArena, but Dortmund’s impressive showing in 2017 means that they start the afternoon the favourites to leave with all three points. Only Bayern, with one more, have picked up a greater number of points than Dortmund since the start of the year, whilst Leverkusen have already lost as many league games this campaign as they did in the entirety of last season."
,action,"Mainz were the most recent side to get the better of Leverkusen in last weekend’s 2-0 victory, whilst last season’s third-place finishers also look to be out of the Champions League after losing 4-2 at home to Atletico Madrid in their last-16 first-leg tie. With rumours circulating that Schmidt may soon be given the boot, he will be desperate for a strong showing from his men today."
,action,"As for Leverkusen, their poor recent form has left many questioning how long Roger Schmidt has left at the club. Just three wins from their last eight Bundesliga games has seen them slip down the table and into eighth place, 10 points behind Dortmund and in danger of dropping into the bottom half if they don’t quickly improve their disappointing form."
,action,"Wolfsburg and Freiburg were both comfortably beaten 3-0 in Dortmund’s previous two outings, and they’ll be looking to do the same today as they try to close the gap between themselves and RB Leipzig to six points. The second-place side were held to a 2-2 draw by Augsburg last night, handing Dortmund an opportunity to continue their push towards the top two."
,action,"Dortmund haven’t won three consecutive Bundesliga games since the end of September, but they have a good chance of doing so today as they take on an out-of-form Leverkusen side. The Black and Yellow’s season has lacked consistency, leaving them trailing league leaders Bayern Munich by 13 points, but they have looked far more dangerous in recent weeks, resulting in them picking up four wins from their last six clashes."
