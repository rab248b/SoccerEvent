,action,That's all from us this afternoon. Thanks for joining us throughout this Bundesliga clash between Darmstadt and Borussia Dortmund.
,action,Full time! Darmstadt record a memorable victory with a deserved win over Borussia Dortmund. The Jonathan-Heimes-Stadion erupted at the final victory as Tuchel raced down the tunnel in disgust.
90'+2',action,Darmstadt have absolutely everybody back in their half now with very few looking to counter-attack. The Bundesliga basement side are so close to a memorable victory to drag them closer to safety here.
90',action,"Heller tries a cheeky effort from range after a poor kick from Burki gives the winger possession 30 yards away from goal as he attempted a chip, but the Swiss goalkeeper was already back on his line and the shot was merely catching practice."
88',action,"Corner for Dortmund in the dying stages as they look to apply pressure, but despite the delivery from Dembele dropping into the box, Rosenthal hooks the ball away to safety and Dortmund are forced to restart."
86',action,"If anybody looks likely to score another in this match it may be Darmstadt. Dortmund are piling the numbers forward, which is expected given the scoreline, but they're creating absolutely nothing and seem very vulnerable on the counter-attack."
85',substitution,Substitution sub-out Artem Fedetskiy sub-in Markus Steinhöfer . Final sub for Darmstadt as Steinhofer comes on for Fedetskiy.
84',action,"Heller does really well to carry the ball and provide some relief for the home side and eventually gets taken to the ground by Dembele much to the annoyance of the support behind the goal who appeal for a penalty, but the referee waves away the protests."
82',action,"A slight stoppage in play as Holland goes down clutching his leg and looks as if he may not continue. It appears only to be cramp, but Frings looks to be withdrawing the full-back to risk a potential injury."
82',substitution,Substitution sub-out Fabian Holland sub-in Leon Guwara . Guwara comes on for Holland.
80',action,"It looks as if Darmstart are starting to retreat now as we enter the final ten minutes, but when Dortmund advance up the pitch the Lilywhites are coming out to press them hard. It's working really well for Frings' side."
79',yellow-card,Yellow Card Dzenis Burnic. Burnic gets a yellow on his debut.
78',action,"A free-kick in a dangerous position allows Dortmund the rare opportunity to get the ball into Darmstadt's box, but Dembele's delivery somehow manages to beat everybody despite landing in the centre of a sea of yellow and blue shirts."
77',yellow-card,Yellow Card Aytac Sulu. Sulu collects a yellow card and a ban for the next fixture.
77',substitution,Substitution sub-out Marco Reus sub-in André Schürrle . Reus makes way for Schurrle.
75',yellow-card,Yellow Card Michael Esser. Esser gets given a caution.
75',action,"This is a refreshing attitude from Darmstadt, who despite leading against Dortmund are clearly after a third goal in this match. With no urgency from the away side, it's looking like they may struggle to get back into this match."
73',yellow-card,Yellow Card Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Aubameyang gets the first yellow of the match.
73',action,"A fantastic turn from Altintop in the middle of the pitch allowed the midfielder to find an overlapping Fedetskiy on the wing, but a drilled cross from the full-back is gathered by Burki in the six-yard box."
71',action,"WOW! Madness. Colak hits the crossbar, Burki then saves the follow-up from Gondorf and Colak is granted another opportunity but Ginter gets back to hook the ball off the line. This half has exploded into life."
69',action,"The home support have erupted following the goal! Frings could be seen punching the air as the hosts go back in front, and once again it's nothing less than they deserve."
67',assist,Assist Sidney Sam. Sam does well to spot the movement of Colak by drifting away from the Dortmund defence and prods a pass through to the striker.
67',goal,Goal Antonio-Mirko Colak. GOAL! Darmstadt take the lead again as Dortmund's defence is everywhere. Colak ghosts away from Burnic and Ginter and is fed the ball before calmly slotting across goal and past Burki.
65',action,Tuchel is clearly had enough of this poor performance with the introduction of Kagawa and Dembele. With the added attacking influence in midfield he'll be hoping to see his side retain possession better in this fixture.
62',substitution,Substitution sub-out Emre Mor sub-in Ousmane Dembélé . Mor's time is up as Dembele comes on to replace him.
62',substitution,Substitution sub-out Raphaël Adelino José Guerreiro sub-in Shinji Kagawa . Kagawa comes on for the goalscorer Guerreiro.
62',action,If Dortmund had been defending like this against any other side in the Bundesliga they would be trailing by at least two goals now. This is nothing short of an embarrassing performance from the away side.
60',action,"CHANCE! Rosenthal sends another glorious chance begging as a mistake at the back is picked up by Heller and he then threads his teammate through on goal, but his shot is miles wide of the target and the visitors can breathe a sigh of relief."
58',action,"More dangerous play from Darmstadt as a cross to the back post is greeted by Rosenthal, but the attacking midfielder is unable to get high enough to head the ball downwards and ends up turning his shot over the crossbar."
58',substitution,Substitution sub-out Terrence Boyd sub-in Antonio-Mirko Colak . First sub of the match as Colak comes on for Boyd.
56',action,"The Lilywhites are continuing to play without fear as Rosenthal flicked the ball over Sokratis' head and earned a free-kick on the edge of the box, but Burki is able to punch away the delivery into the area to keep the scores level."
54',action,"BLOCK! Fantastic block from Altintop as Aubameyang clipped a ball to the back post and found Pulisic in loads of room, but just as the American pulled the trigger on his shot the defensive midfielder chucked his body on the line and stopped the effort from going on goal."
52',action,"SAVE! Burki is called into action again. Heller twists on the left side to find an overlapping Gondorf, who then manages to cut the ball back to Rosenthal on the edge of the box, but the attacking midfielder isn't able to direct his shot away from the Swiss goalkeeper."
50',action,"Dortmund have started this half much better than they did the first. The away side are actually in control of the ball at the moment, although Darmstadt are opting to sit deep and make life difficult for the Yellow-blacks."
48',action,"Sam and Boyd play a great one-two, with the winger then using his pace to drive up the pitch with Rosenthal and Heller in support, but unfortunately he's unable to find another blue shirt with a pass as he approached the edge of the box."
46',action,Darmstadt get the second half underway.
,action,"In truth, you'd suspect Frings would have liked to have gone into half time level before this match had started, but Darmstadt have been much better throughout the first half and should they continue to play like that in the second then Dortmund could be in for a tough afternoon."
45'+1',action,"The goal for Dortmund couldn't have come at a worse time for Darmstadt, although in truth it was a difficult one to prevent. The first true glimpse of Dortmund's quality is finally starting to show."
44',assist,Assist Emre Mor. Mor gets the assist for Dortmund by coming inside to the centre of the pitch and flicking the ball around the corner by playing a one-two with Guerreiro. Wonderful football.
44',goal,Goal Raphaël Adelino José Guerreiro. GOAL! Dortmund get the goal they probably don't deserve just before half time as Guerreiro finds room in the box to smash a half-volley past Esser and into the top corner - a fantastic finish.
42',action,"Aubameyang gets his first opportunity to shoot with a volley from inside the box after a corner from Dortmund, but Esser is does really well to leap and tip the shot over the crossbar from the Gabon international."
40',action,STAT: Darmstadt have failed to win in their last six meetings with Dortmund.
38',action,"Another flowing move from Darmstadt presents Heller with the opportunity to try his luck from range, but the winger's effort was poor in truth as he fired over the crossbar and into the stand behind Burki's goal."
36',action,"Whilst Darmstadt have certainly been the better side, their lack of quality is showing through sometimes when they cheaply give away possession, but it's only their mistakes which is allowing Dortmund any opportunities to attack their defence."
34',action,"CLOSE! A lofted cross is played into the Dortmund box and Rosenthal does really well to beat Sokratis in the air, but the midfielder's header towards goal goes narrowly wide of Burki's left post who was forced to watch the ball dribble past."
32',action,"CROSSBAR! A reckless challenge from Altintop on Mor allows Dortmund the opportunity to shoot from a free-kick approximately 25 yards away from goal, and Reus does really well to get the ball up and over the wall, but the forward is unable to dip the ball underneath the crossbar."
30',action,"Both sides are playing some very good football here. Given Darmstadt's league position, you could be forgiven to expect long ball football from the home side, but they've been using the pitch effectively and have been patient with their passing."
27',action,"Heller is proving to be a real thorn in Dortmund's side again as the winger hugs the line and crosses a ball into the Dortmund box, but this time his delivery isn't good enough and Sokratis heads the ball away from any danger."
25',action,"CHANCE! Reus with Dortmund's first opportunity of the game as Aubameyang threads the German international through on goal, but Esser does well to leave a foot out and block the forward's shot."
23',action,Heller found more room on the left side to create that goal as Dortmund's 3-4-3 is seemingly struggling to deal with the width from the home side as they look to counter-attack on the flanks.
21',goal,Goal Terrence Boyd. GOAL! Darmstadt get the goal they deserve with Boyd! The striker bags his first for the club by drifting off three yellow shirts in the box following a cut-back into the area and firing past Burki.
19',action,Dortmund are starting to show flickers of the side we know by pressing high when not in possession. Reus and Aubameyang forced Niemeyer back to the goalkeeper as the duo raced down on the defender whilst he was on the ball.
17',action,"CHANCE! Excellent approach work from Darmstadt again as a diagonal ball is clipped over the Dortmund defence and Heller opens up his body to volley across goal, but the winger is unable to make a clean connection with his effort and fires into the hands of Burki."
15',action,"Whilst the performance from Dortmund so far is below their usual standard, it isn't stopping the away support from being vocal. The away support are still bouncing in the corner of the Jonathan-Heimes-Stadion."
13',action,"Tuchel appears to be getting frustrated on the side of the pitch, which is to be expected considering the start his side has made to this match, but the referee has a talk with the Dortmund manager to placate him."
11',action,Dortmund must try and take the sting out of this Darmstadt side who are currently playing with their tails in the air. Many were expecting a much more composed start from the visitors but currently they're second best.
9',action,SAVE! Dortmund are all over the place! Sam threads a through ball to Rosenthal and the midfielder has all the time in the world to pick a shot on goal but once again Burki is there to keep the score level. A fantastic start from the home side.
7',action,"SAVE! Burki is called into action with a magnificent diving save. A free-kick was whipped into the box and Rosenthal headers to the back post where Boyd was unmarked, but his effort on goal is pushed away by the Swiss goalkeeper."
5',action,"Early signs of promise for the home team through Heller as the winger uses his pace on the left side to get some room and whip a cross into the box. However, unfortunately for Darmstadt his attempt to find a blue shirt is poor and it goes out for a goal kick."
3',action,"Ginter goes to the floor clutching his leg as Gondorf chases a ball which was going out for a goal kick and clashes with the defender, but the referee thought nothing of it and play was allowed to continue."
1',action,Dortmund get the match underway.
,action,"Just five minutes until kick-off! The fans are in the stands, the amosphere is building and the players are in the tunnel. Not long now."
,action,"Frings has opted for just one change from the 2-0 loss to Eintracht Frankfurt last time out, with Milosevic dropping to the bench and Niemeyer moving from midfield into defence. Altintop has been given the nod to take the vacant space in midfield. Meanwhile, Tuchel hands a debut to teenager Dzenis Burnic and also makes three other changes from the XI against Hertha Berlin in the DFB Pokal."
,action,"Subs: Weidenfeller, Bartra, Dembele, Schurrle, Kagawa, Castro, Passlack."
,action,"Borussia Dortmund (3-4-3): Burki; Burnic, Sokratis, Ginter; Pulisic, Guerreiro, Weigl, Durm; Reus, Aubameyang, Mor."
,action,"Subs: Heuer, Guwara, Milosevic, Vrancic, Steinhofer, Colak, Sirigu."
,action,"Darmstadt (4-2-3-1): Esser; Holland, Sulu, Niemeyer, Fedetskiy; Gondorf, Altintop; Heller, Rosenthal, Sam; Boyd."
,action,CONFIRMED TEAM NEWS
,action,"Thomas Tuchel’s side head into this match coming off the back of a penalty shoot-out against Hertha Berlin in the DFB Pokal, so tired legs may prevent them from cruising in this match which is expected of them. However, they should have enough quality to see them through."
,action,"Residing at the foot of the table, there’s not much that can be said for Darmstadt at the moment except from they’re going to struggle.  Although, all of their points this season have been collected at home, but it remains to be seen whether they’ll be able to take some off Borussia Dortmund."
