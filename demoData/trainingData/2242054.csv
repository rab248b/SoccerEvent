,action,"The referee blows his whistle for the final time and brings an end to what was a really disappointing afternoon for Everton. They were carved open early on and, despite equalising through Pennington, struggled to fully recover, with Liverpool constantly causing them problems when pushing forward. Coutinho was in inspired form, whilst, at the other end of the pitch, Lukaku disappointed against a Reds back-line that was rarely tested."
,action,FULL-TIME: LIVERPOOL 3-1 EVERTON
90'+4',action,Origi wisely holds up the ball near to the corner flag over on the left wing as he tries to run down the clock. Liverpool are just seconds away from another Merseyside derby win and certainly deserve all three points after causing problems for a very average Everton side.
90'+2',action,"Baines and Mirallas link up well deep down the left flank before the latter tries to skip past Matip, but the defender is easily able to keep the Belgian at bay before poking the ball out for a throw-in near to the corner flag."
90',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Roberto Firmino Barbosa de Oliveira sub-in Ragnar Klavan . Liverpool have made their third and final change, with sub-in Ragnar Klavan coming on to replace Firmino."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be four minutes of added time.
88',action,"Lukaku picks up the ball once again, this time just outside of the box, before trying to tee up Valencia over at the far post, but his deep cross is overhit and sails past the Ecuadorian before flying out for a goal-kick."
86',action,"Baines lifts a lovely cross into the heart of the Liverpool penalty that finds Lukaku. The striker hasn't been presented with many chances today but does well to get his head on the ball. However, he's penalised for a push on Lovren and the move comes to nothing."
84',action,"Another chance for Alexander-Arnold! Liverpool patiently move the ball around deep inside the Everton half of the pitch before the youngster unleashes a shot from the edge of the penalty area, but it's sent straight at Robles and is well saved by the Spaniard."
82',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Dominic Calvert-Lewin sub-in Kevin Mirallas . Everton have made their third and final alteration, with Calvert-Lewin making way for sub-in Kevin Mirallas."
81',action,"Lovely cross by Nathaniel Clyne! The full-back charges down the right flank on a wonderful run before curling an even better ball into the middle of the box, where Robles is just about able to get a hand on the cross before it can find Origi in front of goal."
79',action,"Holgate gets himself into a good position midway down the right wing and quickly chips a dangerous cross into the heart of the Liverpool penalty area. Calvert-Lewin rises high as he tries to meet the ball, but, despite his best efforts, he's unable to and it ends up flying over to the opposite flank."
77',action,"Alexander-Arnold almost makes it 4-1! Barry is caught out by Can over on the right wing, allowing the German to break down the right flank before teeing up Alexander-Arnold. The youngster is in a great position inside the box and quickly shoots, but his chipped effort is parried away by the outstretched limbs of Robles."
75',action,"Origi picks up the ball in a pocket of space just outside of the Everton penalty area and quickly tries to shoot, but he's unable to sort out his feet quickly enough and loses out to Gueye."

72',action,"Holgate picks up the ball over on the right wing once again before curling a cross on to the outstretched arm of Milner, resulting in a free-kick for Everton in a good position. Baines steps up and curls a cross towards the near post, where it's easily cleared by Matip."
70',action,"Another chance for Holgate! Everton push back once again before a looping cross finds Holgate in front of goal, but he puts too much power behind his headed effort and can only send it over the top of the crossbar."
69',action,"Great save by Mignolet! The ball dangerously pinballs around the Liverpool box before rolling out to Holgate on the edge. The youngster immediately unleashes a low strike that looks set to find the back of the net after receiving a heavy deflection, but Mignolet does really well to readjust his body before clawing the ball away."
68',yellow-card,Yellow Card Emre Can. Can catches Gueye with a high tackle as the two battle for the ball on the halfway line and becomes the latest player to receive a yellow card.
67',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Matthew Pennington sub-in Gareth Barry . And the second is sub-in Gareth Barry, who takes the place of Pennington. It looks as if Everton are going to switch to a back four."
66',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Tom Davies sub-in Enner Remberto Valencia Lastra . Everton have decided to make a double substitution as they try to find a way back into the game. The first player to come on is Enner Valencia, who takes the place of Davies."
64',action,"Sporting a knee covered in stud marks, Can hobbles off the pitch to receive further medical treatment as the game gets underway once again. He looks to be in a lot of pain but should be able to continue."
62',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ashley Williams. Williams, who was poor in the build-up to Origi's goal, loses the ball midway inside the Everton half of the pitch before flying into Can, who he catches with an awful late challenge that earns the defender a yellow card."
60',assist,"Assist Philippe Coutinho Correia. Once again, Coutinho played a vital role in another Liverpool goal, but Everton were far too sloppy on the ball before being torn apart on the break."
60',goal,"Goal Divock Okoth Origi. GOAL! It's 3-1 to Liverpool! Holgate loses out over on the right flank, allowing Milner to break forward on a quick counter-attack. The left-back immediately tees up Coutinho, who then works the ball on to Origi, and the Belgian easily beats Williams on the edge of the box before firing a great strike past Robles."
59',action,"Origi twists and turns deep down the left flank before cutting past Holgate and unleashing a curling strike, but there's slightly too much power behind the effort and it ends up sailing comfortably wide of the far post."
58',action,"Big block by Milner! Barkley performs well again as he muscles his way along the edge of the Liverpool penalty area before teeing up Holgate. The youngster then tries to find Lukaku with a low cross, but Milner is there to cut out the danger with an outstretched leg."
57',substitution,Substitution sub-out Sadio Mané sub-in Divock Okoth Origi . Mane looks to be in a lot of pain as he hobbles down the tunnel to be replaced by Divock Origi.
56',action,"Chance for Barkley! The midfielder, who has struggled this afternoon, receives the ball just outside of the Liverpool penalty area and quickly shoots, but it lacks the power the beat Mignolet and is well saved by the Belgian."
55',action,"The game gets underway once again as Mane continues receiving medical treatment over on the touchline. Can is quickly penalised for another heavy foul, but once again Everton are unable to make the resulting free-kick count."
53',action,"Ouch! Mane tangles with Baines and ends up twisting his ankle under the body of the full-back, leaving him in a heap on the floor and in serious discomfort. This doesn't look good for the Senegal international..."

49',action,"Coutinho goes close! Can weaves into the left-hand side of the penalty area before unleashing a low shot that Robles is just about able to get a foot on. The ball is deflected out to Coutinho, who is in a dangerous position in front of goal, but Williams is just about able to thump it away before the Brazilian can unleash a shot."
48',action,"Davies is barged off the ball midway inside the Liverpool half of the pitch and picks up a free-kick for Everton in an advantageous position. Barkley steps up and curls a lovely cross into the penalty area that finds Williams, but the centre-back is unable to fully test Mignolet with his poked effort from close range."
46',action,We're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"So far, so good for Liverpool, who are on course to pick up another derby win at Anfield after an impressive first half. Everton have struggled at both ends of the pitch, with their front three not doing enough to test the hosts whenever they're able to pick up possession and their defence looking shaky under pressure. Despite his goal, Pennington has really struggled, whilst Holgate has been caught on the break over on the left wing on more than one occasion."
,action,HALF-TIME: LIVERPOOL 2-1 EVERTON
45'+2',action,"Everton try to push forward on one final attack as they attempt to find an equaliser before half-time, but Liverpool have plenty of bodies back to deal with the danger. Can then gives Jagielka something to think about with a strong run down the right wing, but, despite looking off the pace, the centre-back is just about able to deal with the danger before being fouled from behind."
45'+1',action,"Vital tackle by Gueye! Milner embarks on a great run forward before cutting a clever pass over to Coutinho. The attacking midfielder causes problems for Pennington once again as he twists and turns on the edge of the penalty area, but this time he's dispossessed from behind by Gueye before he can unleash a shot."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be two minutes of added time.
44',action,"Davies picks up the ball midway down the left flank before quickly trying to set up Dominic Calvert-Lewin with a through-ball into the penalty area. The youngster is unable to find it, however, as Simon Mignolet does well to shepherd the ball out for a goal-kick."
42',action,"Ouch! Both managers react angrily after Lucas catches Holgate with a late challenge over on the right wing, but the referee decides to keep his cards in his pocket and instead has a stern word with the Brazilian."
40',action,"Firmino goes close! Coutinho does well to pick up a bouncing ball over on the right flank before curling a lovely cross into the box. It flies towards Firmino and goes close to finding the forward in front of goal, but it ends up sailing just over the top of his head."
39',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ross Barkley. Barkley, who has been diving into challenges all afternoon, stamps on Lovren's foot as he stretches for a loose ball, leaving the referee with no choice put to show him a yellow card. On another day, he easily could have seen red instead."
37',action,"Mane is caught from behind by Gueye and loses out midway inside the Everton half of the pitch, allowing the visitors to counter quickly. Barkley is unable to take advantage of the opportunity, however, as Can easily dispossesses him on the halfway line."
35',action,"That second goal has really brought Liverpool to life, who are now bossing possession in the middle of the pitch. They've moving the ball around really nicely and look hungry for another goal before half-time."

Everton are caught out in the middle of the pitch once again before Coutinho takes on Pennington, who's easily beaten by the number 10 before a beautiful shot is curled past Robles and into the top right-hand corner of the net."

28',assist,Assist Ashley Williams. Assist Ashley Williams
28',goal,"Goal Matthew Pennington. GOAL! Everton have equalised! The visitors push forward on another good attacking move before winning themselves a corner. It's whipped in towards Jagielka, who nods the ball down towards Williams. The centre-back is unable to get a foot on the ball before Dejan Lovren knocks it back to Pennington, who then calmly slots a shot into the back of the net from a few yards out. What a moment for the youngster!"
26',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Tom Davies. Baines steps up and shoots from the set-piece, but his curling strike is poorly hit and fails to beat the wall camped in front of him. The ball then finds Mane as Liverpool try to kick-start a counter-attack, and he's clattered into by a late challenge from Davies that earns the youngster a yellow card."
25',action,"Barkley embarks on another promising run forward as he tries to carve out a chance on goal for the visitors, but he's brought down by a clumsy challenge from Can before he can tee up a team-mate and has to settle for a free-kick just outside of the penalty area."
24',action,"A misplaced pass from Holgate can only find Can, who then quickly sets up Firmino. The forward is in a good position midway inside the Everton half of the pitch and takes on Williams, but it's the centre-back who comes out on top with a well-timed sliding tackle."
22',action,"Baines sprints down the left wing before swinging a cross into the penalty area and towards Lukaku, but Matip is there to blast the ball out for a corner. It's whipped in by Baines and finds Jagielka, but the captain is unable to keep his headed effort down and sends it comfortably wide of the goal."
20',action,"Big chance for Coutinho! Pennington is beaten far too easily by the Brazilian over on the left-hand side of the Everton box before a curling strike is unleashed, but Joel Robles does well to get a hand on the effort before Jagielka heads the ball away from the far post."
18',action,"Mane embarks on another promising run as he cuts inside from the right flank before trying to tee up Coutinho, but the pass is an uncharacteristically poor one from the Senegal international and fails to find the Brazilian."
16',action,"Good play by Everton! A lovely cross from Baines flies over the head of Milner and finds Mason Holgate, but the youngster is unable to control the ball and get a shot away. It's then picked up by Matthew Pennington, who chips a deft cross back into the middle of the penalty area, but this time it flies just over Lukaku and out for a goal-kick."
14',action,"Baines cuts inside from the left flank and tees up Gueye, who then quickly fires a pass up towards Romelu Lukaku. It finds the big Belgian on the edge of the Liverpool box but he's unable to control the ball, allowing the home side to regain possession once again."
12',action,"After a difficult five minutes, Everton are able to push forward on another attacking move through Barkley, but after initially doing well to break up to the penalty area, the midfielder is unable to beat Milner and loses out to the left-back."
10',action,"Philippe Coutinho almost makes it 2-0! Liverpool push forward again from the restart as they try to hit their opponents on another determined attacking move.

8',goal,"Goal Sadio Mané. GOAL! What a start by Liverpool! Mane bursts through the middle of the pitch as he easily skips past Tom Davies. He darts towards the edge of the penalty area before taking on both Ashley Williams and Matthew Pennington, the latter of whom is nutmegged by a lovely low shot that finds the bottom right-hand corner of the net."
8',assist,"Assist Roberto Firmino Barbosa de Oliveira. It was Roberto Firmino who set up Mane, but that goal was all about the Senegalese attacking midfielder. Everton didn't do at all well enough in trying to stop his run forward, with Davies looking particularly flat-footed."
7',action,"Can is pulled back by Gueye as he's put under pressure midway inside the Everton half of the pitch, resulting in a free-kick for Liverpool. It's taken quickly and sent short, but the hosts are unable to make the set-piece count and have to play the ball back to Joel Matip."
5',action,"Ouch! Emre Can receives the ball in the middle of the pitch but a heavy touch sends it away from him. He stretches for it but is clattered into by a hefty challenge from Barkley, leaving the German in a heap on the floor. The referee decides not to show a yellow card, however, and instead gives the Everton midfielder a stern talking to."
3',action,"Everton continue their bright start to the game as Idrissa Gueye weaves his way through the middle of the pitch. He's dispossessed, however, and Liverpool then counter quickly, but Phil Jagielka is there to make sure that Sadio Mane can't dart down the right wing."
1',action,"With just 17 seconds on the clock, the first free-kick is awarded for a late challenge. Ross Barkley pushes up towards the Liverpool penalty area before losing the ball and catching James Milner, sending the left-back crashing to the ground."

,action,"The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."

,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"Both sides were handed serious injury concerns during the international break, with Seamus Coleman’s horrendous leg break when on duty for the Republic of Ireland being the worst of the lot. Everton are also without James McCarthy, Ramiro Funes Mori and Morgan Schneiderlin, whilst Liverpool aren't able to call on Jordan Henderson, Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana, the latter of whom could prove to be a big loss."
,action,"Despite their struggles this side of Stanley Park, Everton will feel confident about their chances of finally ending their agonising wait for a victory. They've won three of their last four games, with 11 goals being scored during that time. Tottenham are the only side against whom the Toffees have lost in the league this year, but they’ll be well aware that their final defeat of 2016 came in the last Merseyside derby."
,action,"The high-octane and entertaining contest against City two weeks ago resulted in a point that would have pleased Klopp, setting them up nicely for a must-win clash against their local rivals. Despite Everton’s good form at the moment, Liverpool have the history books on their side, as it’s now 18 years since the Toffees last tasted victory at Anfield."
,action,"A slightly topsy-turvy run of form since the start of 2017 has left Liverpool in danger of dropping out of the top four, but things have been looking up for them over the past month and a half and they head into today’s derby clash with just one defeat from their last five games. A resurgent Leicester City are the only side to have beaten the Reds in recent weeks, with Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal and Manchester City all failing to get the better of Jurgen Klopp’s men during that time."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Merseyside derby between Liverpool and Everton at Anfield.
