,action,"FULL-TIME! Atletico drop two points in the title race, in what has turned out to be a fantastic weekend for Real Madrid. Simeone's men draw 0-0 with Espanyol at home, and fail to capitalise on Barcelona and Sevilla dropping points in La Liga earlier today. Quique Sanchez Flores' men keep up their good form, but their gain is most certainly Los Colchoneros' loss. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+2',action,"Diop clears a cross in from the left-hand side by Filipe Luis, with Espanyol getting deeper and deeper. Tackles are flying in on the periphery of the penalty area, as Flores' men look to dig in and grind another result out."
90'+1',action,There are four minutes of stoppage time at the Vicente Calderon.
90',action,"Atletico win a corner on the right-hand side, but it is cleared behind for a second set-piece. The successive ball into the box is intended for Godin, but Espanyol manage to get the danger away. Caicedo tries to lead a break, and releases Hernan Perez down the left, with an eventual delivery blasted over at the back post by Salva Sevilla."
88',yellow-card,Yellow Card Diego Roberto Godín Leal. Godin gets a yellow card in the dying minutes for Atletico.
88',action,"What a save from Diego Lopez! Griezmann is denied by the referee's whistle anyway, but the goalkeeper wasn't to know. The Frenchman rattled a half-volley goalwards, which was tipped onto the crossbar from close-range by the former Real Madrid shot-stopper. It just isn't the home side's night, it seems!"
87',action,"Espanyol tries to break upfield, but Caicedo is penalised for a foul on Koke, with Atletico pushing forward relentlessly. Play is opened out to the right-hand side, but Correa sees a delivery charged down. The away side are desperately defending to hold onto a share of the spoils."
85',action,"What a chance for Griezmann! The France international is picked out by a great cross from the left-hand side, but guides a close-range shot straight down Diego Lopez's throat. He hides his face under his shirt, he knows that should have been 1-0."
83',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Kevin Gameiro sub-in Saúl Ñíguez Esclapez . Saul is introduced for the last five minutes or so, with Gameiro withdrawn. The home fans aren't quite sure how to react to that change."
82',action,"Correa gets to the right byline and clips a cross into the box, but Gameiro can only guide an effort wide of the target. There is then a stoppage in play, as Diop goes down in a heap after colliding with a teammate. Sevilla appears to have hurt his teammate."
81',action,"Correa goes down in the box and looks for a penalty, but the referee isn't interested and it appeared that the Argentine substitute went down very easily indeed. Espanyol break down the right in response, but Salva Sevilla opts to be patient and play backwards, rather than risk losing possession high upfield. Flores' men look happy to take a point home with them."
79',action,"Griezmann gets to the left byline and plays a neat back-heel into the penalty area, but Espanyol clear. Gameiro espcares down the same flank moments later, and jinks into the box, but the Frenchman can't get a shot away."
77',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Gerard Moreno Balaguero sub-in Felipe Salvador Caicedo Corozo . Gerard Moreno takes his leave too, as Quique Sanchez Flores looks to wind down the clock. Felipe Caicedo comes into the game up top."
76',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Leonardo Carrilho Baptistão sub-in Salvador Sevilla López . Baptistao takes his leave for the hosts, with Salva Sevilla given the last 15 minutes to impress."
75',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Gerard Moreno Balaguero. Gerard Moreno gets a yellow card for a very late tackle on Godin, and he can have no complaints."
75',action,"A cross is whipped into the penalty area from deep by Godin, with Griezmann the target, but Diego Lopez comes off his line to collect. The hosts just can't seem to figure out the best way to break down an Espanyol side who are keeping things tight in between their lines."
73',action,"Gameiro cuts in from the left-hand side and finds the feet of Correa, but the substitute's shot from 20 yards out is blocked easily. Simeone's men are dominating the ball and calling the shots, but still the hosts can't seem to find a way through this Espanyol rear-guard."
71',substitution,Substitution sub-out Yannick Ferreira Carrasco sub-in Ángel Martín Correa . Simeone shakes things up by replacing Carrasco with Correa for the final 20 minutes.
70',action,"Juanfran and Carrasco combine down the right-hand side, but a low, drilled cross from the former is turned behind by a combination of Reyes and Diego Lopez. Griezmann was very close to nipping ahead of the Mexican! Atletico maintain their pressure, with a delivery curled in from the left, but Gimenez heads a long way wide of the target."
68',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Tiago Cardoso Mendes sub-in Osvaldo Nicolás Fabián Gaitán . Tiago takes his leave, with the more offensively-minded Gaitan introduced."
68',action,"Atletico are moving the ball around and probing for a gap, but they aren't playing with a high enough tempo to cause real danger. Juanfran is found overlapping down the right-hand side, but his cushioned ball square across the box is turned behind for a corner. The hosts whip the set-piece in, but Diego Lopez claims over Godin."
66',action,"Great save from Diego Lopez! The Espanyol goalkeeper gets down to his right-hand side brilliantly to parry a shot from Gabi away, with Griezmann only able to fire an effort from the rebound wide of the far post from a tight angle. That is the best opportunity that Atleti have had this evening."
64',action,"Victor Sanchez gets down the right-hand side and tries to bend a cross in towards the near post, but Oblak is able to claim very easily. Both of these teams are trading blows, but none are really landing. Some fresh legs and ideas from the bench might be required to settle this one."
62',action,"Carrasco gets to the edge of the penalty area, but bends a terrible effort high and wide, leaving Griezmann frustrated with his decision-making. Atletico are really struggling to find their way through, but Espanyol may come to rue missing two great chances in this game. Half an hour remains for a breakthrough goal."
60',action,"Godin goes down in the penalty area, after climbing all over his man, but the referee thinks that it is a case of both players being more bothered about their opponent than the ball itself. Gabi tries to feed Juanfran down the right flank, but Aaron intercepts. Espanyol counter and Baptistao goes through one-on-one, but Oblak makes a great stop!"
58',action,"A long, diagonal pass searches for Filipe Luis on the overlap, with Atleti being forced into playing terrible direct football to try and break down this resilient Espanyol set-up. It heads direct out of play, however, and there are a few whistles from the home crowd. Gabi takes aim from long-range once again, but his effort strikes Gameiro."
56',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Pablo Daniel Piatti sub-in Hernán Arsenio Pérez González . Piatti is the first man to be replaced for the away side, with Hernan Perez coming into the game."
54',action,"Juanfran tries to wriggle down the right and whip in a cross, but Aaron Martin makes a brilliant block. The hosts are starting to settle down a little more, but a Filipe Luis delivery from the left is now denied by Baptistao. It earns Los Colchoneros a corner, but the resulting ball in fails to beat the first man."
52',action,"Carrasco takes a lofted pass down brilliantly, before getting the ball onto his right foot, but the Belgian runs into trouble. Moments later, a terrible pass from Koke gifts possession away, but Espanyol are happy to stroke the ball around rather than go straight on the offensive. Simeone won't be pleased with how his players have come out after the break."
50',action,"Koke clips Baptistao's heels, which leads to the Spain international getting given a warning by the referee. He has, after all, already got a booking this evening. Piatti tries to scamper down the right-hand side and whip in a ball from the byline, but Gimenez recovers brilliantly to concede a corner. Espanyol whip in a brilliant delivery, which forces Godin to clear ahead of Gerard Moreno!"
48',action,"Espanyol look to mount a counter-attack, which is eventually halted by a foul from Tiago, but the referee doesn't go for his book. Atletico then foray down the right-hand side, but Gameiro runs into traffic and gives away possession with a terrible pass. An even start to the half!"
46',action,"We are back underway at Estadio Vicente Calderon! Simeone's men have been unable to find a breakthrough so far, but they need to buck up their ideas quickly if they are to take advantage of Barcelona and Sevilla's poor results today."
,action,"HALF-TIME! Espanyol manage to get into the break with the scoreline level, in what has been an interesting stalemate so far. Atletico were strong in the early stages and have called the shots, but Quique Sanchez Flores has his side defending brilliantly. Gerard Moreno should have made it 1-0 to the visitors, so Diego Simeone's men have got it all to do after the interval!"
44',action,"Espanyol will be pleased with how they have threatened on the break, but that chance from Gerard Moreno could come back to haunt the away side. The visitors are sitting deep and in numbers, as they look to get into the interval unscathed."
42',action,"Great save from Oblak! Gerard Moreno is fed in behind the home side's defensive line, but the ex-Benfica goalkeeper makes himself very big and stands tall. The Espanyol striker shoots straight at his huge frame as a result, and that's a huge opportunity missed for the visitors."
40',action,"Diego Reyes does well to deny Gameiro on the edge of the Espanyol penalty area, as the away side continue to pack bodies around the box in an attempt to congest what could be useful spaces for the hosts. Flores' men break as a result, with Aaron found out on the left, but a whipped cross is nodded into touch by Gimenez."
38',action,"Baptistao drives down the right-hand side, but the Brazilian is penalised for grabbing hold of Filipe Luis. The hosts respond with a patient attack, which sees the hosts work the ball out to the left. Espanyol are keeping things very tight and playing as a unit."
36',action,"Atletico win themselves a corner on the left-hand side, which Diego Lopez does well to punch away from the head of Godin. The rebound falls to an Espanyol player, fortunately for the away team. With around 10 minutes until the break, the visitors are right in this contest."
34',action,"Godin is caught offside, after a neat move from Atletico that saw Griezmann stab an incisive pass in behind the opposition lines. The Uruguay international had stayed up following a set-piece, and got found out for the offensive frailties in his game!"
32',action,"Juanfran drills a cross in from the right byline, but Espanyol hack the danger clear. Jurado and Gerard Moreno combine on the counter, with the latter then being blocked off by Gimenez. The Uruguay international escapes a yellow card, however. Rather inconsistent, given Koke's booking. The away side are causing a few issues on the break."
30',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Jorge Resurrección Merodio. Koke picks up a yellow card for the home side, after cynically tripping Piatti on the half-way line. An easy booking for the referee to dish out."
29',action,"Koke tries to feed a cute throughball into the left channel, but Gameiro isn't on the same wavelength as his teammate and doesn't make the right run. Moments later, Espanyol try to threaten themselves, but a drilled pass forward that searches for Baptistao, instead finds Oblak. Neither team can find their cutting edge."
27',action,"Espanyol win themselves a free-kick, but the chance quickly is thrown away as Gerard Moreno is penalised for pushing Tiago. This game has been very untidy so far, but the away side are growing in confidence a little. The Catalan club are keeping things compact and restricting space in between the lines."
25',action,"Gameiro is the target of a long ball from Filipe Luis, but Reyes makes an easy clearance ahead of the former PSG man. A second direct pass searches for the same man moments later, but this time Diego Lopez is quick off his line to gather up the ball and defuse the situation."
23',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Papa Kouly Diop. Tiago nearly gives the ball away terribly in the middle of the park, with Gimenez quick to intercept ahead of Moreno. Diop then dives into a 50-50 and wins the ball, but the referee books him!"
21',action,"The home side are constantly on the front foot, but that effort from Gerard Moreno will let Atleti know that they can't lower their guard. Carrasco tries to slide a throughball into Gameiro's path, but Victor Sanchez makes a simple interception."
19',action,"Gabi tries his luck from around 25 yards out, but the Atletico captain can only fire straight at Diego Lopez. The ex-Milan goalkeeper has been very busy so far. Espanyol counter down the left-hand side, with Aaron Martin finding Moreno at the back post, but the former Villarreal man can only spin and dribble a terrible shot towards Oblak."
17',action,"Tiago plays a lovely ball to the right byline, which is disguised brilliantly, allowing for Koke to make a forward run. The Spain international tries to pull a powerful cross back from the flank, but it fizzes into Diego Lopez's gloves. Oblak, meanwhile, has been a spectator so far."
15',action,"David Lopez is forced to make another rushed clearance, as Filipe Luis and Carrasco combine down the left once again. Atletico are piling on the pressure, but Diego Lopez is being well protected so far. Espanyol are just packing players behind the ball, with the hosts' full-backs given plenty of opportunity to get forward."
13',action,"Gameiro is the target of a lofted throughball, but the ex-Sevilla man can only race in behind the Espanyol defensive line and take a poor touch. The ball bounces off the toe of the Frenchman, with there then enough pace on it to see the chance vanish. Simeone's men keep their pressure on, but a cross from Juanfran is eventually cleared by Victor Sanchez."
11',action,"Atletico keep moving the ball around and probing for a gap, with Griezmann prepared to drop deep and find pockets of space. Espanyol are just defending the edge of their penalty area, before a drilled cross from Filipe Luis is cleared behind for a corner by David Lopez. It is clear what the away side's gameplan is!"
9',action,"Filipe Luis feeds a pass back to Carrasco, who then bends a cross into the near post. The inswinging ball is chased by Gameiro, who can't get a touch, with the ball bouncing off the turf and into the awaiting arms of Diego Lopez. That was incredibly close to the first goal of the evening."
7',action,"Baptistao goes on a bursting run down the right-hand side, and tries to scamper into the box, but the Brazilian is blocked off - but the referee waves play on. Atletico are dominating possession and calling the shots, but that brief foray forward from the visitors shows that Sanchez Flores' men are prepared to push on whenever they can."
5',action,"Atletico win themselves a free-kick on the right-hand side, which is swept into the box. Godin rises highest, but Reyes does well to get up and make a block in front of the Uruguayan. It results in a corner, which is guided towards the new post, but Espanyol clear."
3',action,"The home side start with a lengthy spell of possession, as Espanyol are happy to sit back in their shape and absorb early pressure. Some Atletico fans have unfurled a banner to thank Quique Sanchez Flores for his tenure with Los Colchoneros - that's a nice touch."
