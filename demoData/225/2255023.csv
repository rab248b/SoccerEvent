,action,"Robert Lewandowski scored twice, while Thomas Muller ended his Bundesliga scoring drought at 999 minutes, as Carlo Ancelotti's side cruise past a toothless Wolves side. That's all for our live coverage, thanks for following along. Goodbye!"
90',action,FULL-TIME: BAYERN 5-0 WOLFSBURG.
88',action,"STAT: Bayern have failed to keep a clean sheet in their last five league games, something which hasn’t happened for five years. The last time they went on a longer run of conceding in the Bundesliga was between April and August 2011 (7; spanning multiple seasons)."
86',goal,"Goal Douglas Costa de Souza. SENSATIONAL FINISH! No mercy from Bayern here as the Brazilian gets in on the fun! He absolutely smashes a strike at goal after a weak clearance, sending a lighting bolt into the top corner! Incredible finish, that!"
84',action,"Thomas Müller (25) had had more shots without scoring this season than any other Bundesliga players coming into today. It's got to be such a relief for him, and for Bayern, who will be hoping that goal opens the floodgates for him."
83',substitution,Substitution sub-out Jakub Błaszczykowski sub-in Adelino André Vieira Freitas . Blaszczykowski is replaced for the latter stages by Vieirinha.
81',substitution,Substitution sub-out Thiago Alcântara do Nascimento sub-in Márcio Rafael Ferreira de Souza . Rafinha comes on for the final 10 minutes as Bayern use their third substitution to give Thiago a rest.
79',action,"OFF THE POST! A rare glimpse at goal for Wolfsburg as Caligiuri is teed up at the far post by Gomez. He cuts onto his left and hammers an effort at goal, but Neuer does brilliantly to turn it onto the post before Bernat blocks the follow-up!"
77',substitution,Substitution sub-out Franck Bilal Ribéry sub-in Douglas Costa de Souza . Bayern make their second change here as Douglas Costa replaces Ribery.
76',goal,"Goal Thomas Müller. MULLER HAS HIS GOAL AT LAST! The striker finally gets off the mark this season in the Bundesliga, and you can see what that means to him! Cue the celebrations! It's a gift of a goal from in close, turning the ball into the relatively gaping goal as the ball deflected kindly into his path off the boot of Robben."
73',action,"Bayern are closing up for the day it would appear, as they pass it around patiently near the halfway line, keen to run the final 17 minutes off the clock. The points are in their back pocket and they can now look ahead to next weekend's trip to face an equally struggling Darmstadt side."
71',substitution,Substitution sub-out Arturo Erasmo Vidal Pardo sub-in Xabier Alonso Olano . Xabi Alonso replaces Vidal for the final 20 minutes.
69',action,"If Wolfsburg have any fight in them, now is the time for it. The hosts have this innate ability to close up shop when they so chose and milk time off the clock. When they get in that mode, it's going to officially be game over for the visitors, who would love at least a consolation goal here."
67',action,"This is turning into a walk in the park for Wolfsburg, as Benaglio's goal continues to come under pressure, not because Bayern are playing with any real urgency, but instead because the visitors have switched off in defence."
65',action,STAT: Carlo Ancelotti has the best points-per-game average of all current Bundesliga coaches (2.31) – Valerian Ismael has the worst (0.67).
63',action,"Robert Lewandowski's goal gives him two or more in a Bundesliga match for the 34th time. Only six players have managed to do so on more occasions, at truly incredible feat for the striker at just 28-years-old. He just loves playing Wolfsburg, and he's got fire in his boots here as he goes in search of his hat-trick goal."
61',substitution,Substitution sub-out Borja Mayoral Moya sub-in Justin Möbius . Borja Mayoral's completely ineffective afternoon ends as he's replaced by Justin Mobius.
60',action,"Surely it's job done for Bayern this afternoon now, as they will turn one eye to the Bundesliga scoreboard to see if they'll be moving top today. A quick glance here shows RB Leipzig are still trailing in Ingolstadt."
58',assist,"Assist Thomas Müller. That's one of the easier - or luckier, even - assists Muller will get in his career."
58',goal,"Goal Robert Lewandowski. GAME, SET AND MATCH! That's a work of art from Lewandowski! He somehow reacts in a fraction of a second to redirect Muller's strike, which was going wide, in at the near post! Exquisite finish from the striker!"
56',action,"Guilavogui has been excellent for Wolfsburg today. He's provided outstanding cover for the back four, putting in some exceptional challenges to break up Bayern attacks. He's at it again here, slowing Ribery on the break before heading a Lahm cross to safety."
54',action,"STAT: Bayern have won 21 of their 22 home games in all competitions against Wolfsburg (with the exception of a 3-3 draw in December 2001). The Bavarians have scored 62 goals in that period (2.8 per game), conceding 15 (0.7)."
52',action,"Encouraging spell for Wolfsburg here as they win a free-kick to the left of goal, on the very edge of the box, as Gerhardt is tripped up by Lah,. The ensuing delivery is a letdown, however, as Bayern get a head to it, before Caligiuri runs it out for a goal-kick."
50',action,"BENAGLIO AGAIN! The keeper has been very sharp this afternoon and he's at it again here, spreading himself wide to turn aside a good effort from Ribery, who found a nice little pocket of space just inside the penalty area."
48',action,"Can Wolfsburg produce any sort of fight back in this second half? They start decently, seeing a good share of the ball, before a wildly speculative effort from Gerhardt sails harmlessly behind for a goal-kick, gifting possession back to the hosts."
46',action,Back underway at the Allianz Arena...
,action,"It's all gone according to script for Bayern as Arjen Robben and Robert Lewandowski have them comfortably ahead at the interval, at the end of a completely one-sided half of football in Munich - and frankly, it could have been worse for Wolfsburg."
45',action,HALF-TIME: BAYERN 2-0 WOLFSBURG.
43',action,"CRUCIAL FROM LAHM! That might have been the first touch for Mario Gomez tonight in an attacking position. A cross in from the right is flicked on delightfully by the striker, and it nearly falls so kindly for Gerhardt in the centre. It would have been a rather easy finish from eight yards for the midfielder, but Lahm somehow comes around from the back with cover, sliding in at the vital moment to knock it away!"
41',action,"Successive corners for Bayern come to nothing, though it's helped to keep the visitors hemmed back in their own end. There's been little respite for the Wolfsburg defence in this first half, desperate now to get this game into the interval."
39',action,"Ribery and Bernat have been particularly lively for Bayern in this first half, and are a bit unlucky not to have combined or at least contributed to a goal in this first half. They find themselves in space as a ball comes through to them in the air, but they both attack it, as Ribery's eventual header, intended as a pass for Bernat, runs out for a throw."
37',action,"NOT QUITE! That's just too easy for Bayern! Ribery goes sprinting down the left and en route into the area, all he can do is cut onto his right as he's too close to the touchline, but still manages to get by a shockingly complicit Knoche, before teeing up Lewandowski. The striker turns and fires from close range, but Bruma does well to get a block in!"
35',action,"Wolfsburg are really trying to buckle down and focus. They learned their lesson last season. You can't afford to get discouraged against a team like Bayern, because they will make you pay. Any complacency is sure to be punished, and the Wolves are well aware of that as they work hard to get this to half-time without any further damage being inflicted."
33',action,"STAT: Wolfsburg have won just 9% of their competitive meetings with FC Bayern, losing 75% of matches."
31',action,"The tempo has fizzled out a bit as we reach the half-hour mark, but the noise in the stadium increases as the fans are informed of the scores across Germany this afternoon. It's met by another Bayern attack, but this time Rodriguez does well to ensure Muller's header sails over the bar."
29',action,"To make matters even better for Bayern, Ingolstadt has taken the lead on RB Leipzig at the Audi Sportpark, while Dortmund also find themselves behind in Koln. Still plenty of time left, but it's shaping up to be a near-perfect day for Bayern."
27',action,"This looks rather ominous for Wolfsburg, hardly able to keep the ball for more than a short period before Bayern win it back and immediately arrive in attack. The hosts look hungry for goals today and seem more than capable of satisfying that appetite."
25',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Thiago Alcântara do Nascimento. Thiago goes into the book for Bayern, the first yellow shown in this first half by the referee."
24',action,STAT: Robert Lewandowski netted five goals in eight minutes and 59 seconds when the sides met in Munich on matchday six last season – the quickest five-goal haul in Bundesliga history.
22',substitution,Substitution sub-out Marcel Schäfer sub-in Jannes-Kilian Horn . Schafer has succumbed to his injury here and is replaced by sub-in Jannes-Kilian Horn.
22',goal,"Goal Robert Lewandowski. MAKE IT TWO! Simple as it gets for Lewandowski, able to roll the easist of finishes past a scrabling Benaglio after a shot deflected kindly into his path, unmarked at the far post. That's some rather poor defending from Wolfsburg, it must be said. Not nearly reactive enough."
20',action,"Bayern back in the ascendency and looking for more. Ribery picks out an incisive pass for Lewandowski inside the area, and the striker does well to hold off Knoche, but Guilavogui arrives with support to poke the ball free."
18',assist,Assist Philipp Lahm. Lahm is credited with the assist.
18',goal,"Goal Arjen Robben. WOLFSBURG'S RESITANCE IS BROKEN! It sure didn't take too long! Vintage Robben here as the Dutchman takes a simple pass from Lahm and cuts onto his left at the edge of the penalty area, before bending a stunning strike in at the far post, beyond Benaglio's reach!"
17',action,"OUCH! Schafer goes down after a coming together with Lahm. It was all very innocent from the duo, both going up to try and head a ball on, but as they went to ground, Lahm fell and Schafer's ankle got caught and seemed to roll up under him. That's a painful one without a doubt. Hopefully he'll be alright to continue."
15',action,"Bayern are looking more threatening with each attack. They're committing bodies forward in numbers and it's starting to become a worry for Wolfsburg, who are having to absorb a lot of pressure. They're doing well to keep their shape for the time being, however."
13',action,"STAT: Bayern have won their last nine Bundesliga games when they have not been top of the table. Their last such loss dates back to April 2012 (1-0 in Dortmund). They won 21 of the subsequent matches in this scenario (W21, D5)."
11',action,"ROBBEN SAVED! Not the best contact in the end from the Dutchman, but he'll be encouraged by that move. It's too easy for him to cut inside on that favoured left foot of his, on the edge of the box, before trying to bend an effort towards the far post. It's too central in the end, however, as Benaglio makes a simple stop."
9',action,"OUTSTANDING SAVE! Bayern carve Wolfsburg apart with their first real attack of the afternoon! Bayern have players queuing up at the far post as Lewandowski holds the ball up well atop the area before playing Bernat through. The left-back has a clear sight of goal from 10 yards, but Benaglio spreads himself brilliantly to turn the effort over the bar!"
7',action,"Well you can't do that! Guilavogui finds himself under a bit of pressure near the halfway line, so he plays a pass back to his keeper, but it's a dreadful back-pass that winds up running behind for a corner. Bayern are good enough that you can't be gifting them opportunities. Luckily for the midfielder, his side are able to defend the subsequent set-piece."
5',action,"Bayern are knocking it around patiently, enjoying plenty of possession, but they're largely being kept inside their own half on the ball. They've hardly been able to advance it into any real threatening positions in these opening stages."
3',action,"Revenge is on the mind of Wolfsburg as they start with a good burst of energy. They will still have nightmares of their 5-1 defeat at this venue last season, and will be eager to avenge that scoreline tonight."
1',action,"AND WE'RE OFF! Bayern get us underway, in their red tops, attacking right to left, with Wolfsburg in white and green."
,action,"Valerien Ismael makes two changes following their late defeat to Hertha last weekend. Jakub Blaszczykowski and Marcel Schafer come in on the flanks, with plenty of responsibility in defence, replacing Maximilian Arnold and the suspended Paul Seguin."
,action,"Carlo Ancelotti makes four changes to the side that defeated Atletico on Tuesday night. Philipp Lahm and Javi Martinez come into defence to replace Rafinha and Mats Hummels, while Thomas Muller and Franck Ribery join Arjen Robben in flanking Robert Lewandowski, as Renato Sanches and Douglas Costa are dropped to the bench."
,action,"SUBS: Vieirinha, Trasch, Horn, Gustavo, Mobius, Casteels, Hansen."
,action,"WOLFSBURG (3-5-2): Benaglio; Knoche, Bruma, Rodriguez; Blaszczykowski, Caligiuri, Guilavogui, Gerhardt, Schafer; Gomez, Mayoral."
