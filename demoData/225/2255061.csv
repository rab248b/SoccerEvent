90',action,There will be a minimum of two minutes added on here.
88',action,Both teams are eager to score a winning goal here. It was always dangerous for Dortmund to try and hold onto a one-nil lead and they have been made to pay by Mainz. This tie could certainly go either way now.

85',action,"Mainz are now pressing for a winning goal! Could they nick all three points here, after Dortmund have been in the lead for so long?"

83',goal,"Goal Danny Latza. GOOOAAALLL! MAINZ EQUALISE! Danny Latza heads home the equalising goal after a superb cross to him at the far post from Öztunali. Latza simply wasn't picked up at the far post and he powered the ball into the back of the net, giving Burki no chance."
81',action,"Schmelzer hsa the opportunity to double Dortmund's lead from a free-kick in a very good position, however his attempt is straight into the hands of Lossl. The Mainz keeper immediately sets up an attacking move for his side."
78',action,"Mainz are starting to go more direct now, playing long balls towards Seydel but so far nothing has come of it. Dortmund's centre-back pairing of Ginter and Sokratis are doing a good job of keeping Mainz well away from their goal."

69',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Fabian Frei sub-in Aaron Seydel . Second Mainz substitution of the game as sub-out Fabian Frei comes off to be replaced by targetman, sub-in Aaron Seydel."
69',action,"Dortmund are doing what they did for large spells in the first half, slowing the pace of the game down to their liking and spraying the ball around with ease."
66',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Raphaël Adelino José Guerreiro sub-in Mario Götze . Dortmund now make their first substitution of the game, with Guerreiro the man to come off and he is replaced by sub-in Mario Götze."
66',action,Piszczek makes a terrific run down the right flank and whips a ball into the box for Aubameyang who tries to glance the ball into the back of the net. However his header is well blocked by Bungert.
64',action,A second goal here for Dortmund would surely ensure that they gathered all three points here tonight. Mainz aren't fashioning too many chances and Dortmund have plenty of quality players on the bench to step up and try to double their lead.
62',substitution,Substitution sub-out Jean-Philippe Gbamin sub-in André Ramalho Silva . Mainz make the first substitution of the game with sub-out Jean-Philippe Gbamin coming off to be replaced by sub-in André Ramalho Silva.

Good opportunity for Dortmund."

54',yellow-card,Yellow Card Jean-Philippe Gbamin. Mainz midfielder Gbamin is the first player to receive a yellow card for a late foul in the middle of the pitch.
53',action,"Sokratis gives away a silly free-kick on the edge of his own box towards the byline, giving Mainz the opportunity to bring plenty of players forward. The free-kick is played to Jairo Samperio, who attempts a shot at goal but it is well blocked."
52',action,All of the noise here is being made by the Dortmund supporters who have made the journey here today. So far they will be very happy with their sides performance.
50',action,"This is better from Dortmund, they managed to withstand a bit of early Mainz pressure which didn't come to anything. Now the likes of Schurrle and Reus are starting to get themselves back into the game."
48',action,"Bright start to the second half by Mainz, as they look to try and score an equaliser as quickly as they can. They have a free-kick in a good position down the right wing, standing over it is Levin-Mete Oztunali...

46',action,We're underway!
,action,The teams are back out and the second half is almost ready to begin!
,action,"Dortmund deservedly hold a one-nil lead at the break thanks to an early goal from Marco Reus. Chances have been few and far between for both sides, however it is the visitors who have created more opportunities and they look more likely to score again."

41',action,"Castro gets the ball on the edge of the area, with plenty of teammates in support of him but he takes far too long on the ball and it is nicked away from him by Danny Latza who tries to counter-attack for Mainz. However Castro tracks back well and wins the ball back."
38',action,"Up next for Dortmund is a potentially cracking game, they face second-placed RB Leipzig. Whilst Mainz travel to Hoffenheim."
36',action,"Mainz have certainly grown into this game, they now seem to have a grip on the formation and way that Dortmund are playing. Schurrle and Reus have just switched flanks in order to change things up for the visitors."
34',action,"This pace of the game has picked up slightly in the last few minutes, as Mainz have started to play the ball around much better. However they are struggling to create anything in the Dortmund final third, at the moment it is all on the half-way line."
31',action,"Chance for Mainz! Brosinski takes a long throw in line with the 18-yard box which is met by Gbamin, he tries to flick in the ball on and over the arms of Burki, but he gets too much on it and it goes out for a goal-kick to Dortmund."
30',action,"As we reach the 30 minute mark in the game it is still Dortmund who lead thanks to Marco Reus' early goal. Dortmund have had the better chances to double their lead, with Mainz struggling to contain the likes of Schurrle and Aubameyang."

19',action,"Aubameyang certainly looks lively tonight for the visitors, on his return to the club from AFCON. Schurrle did well down the right and played a cross into the box looking for the striker, however it was cleared to the edge of the box but Marcel Schmelzer tried his luck from long-range, the shot is just about gathered by the Mainz keeper with Aubameyang eager to try and slot home the rebound."
17',action,"STAT: Dortmund love playing against Mainz - They have won 10 of their last 11 Bundesliga games vs. Mainz (L1) – their best return against a particular side in that period (30 points, same as vs. Werder Bremen)."
14',action,"GOAL DISALLOWED! Mainz had the ball in the back of the net but it is ruled out for offside! Yoshinori Muto receives the ball over the top of the Dortmund backline from Giulio Donati, he then slots the ball underneath Bürki in the Dortmund goal, however it is rightly ruled out for offside."
12',action,"Jean-Philippe Gbamin tries to play a simple ball in midfield however his pass is sloppy and Gonzalo Castro picks it up and runs at the Mainz defence, luckily for Gbamin the Dortmund man is crowded out in the box before he can get a shot off at goal."

5',action,"ALMOST ANOTHER! Dortmund come close to doubling their lead after just five minutes played! Reus received the ball on the edge of the box, he tries to make room for a shot but is crowded out. The ball then gets played to the wing and whipped into the box, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang rose highest but his header is blocked."
3',assist,"Assist André Schürrle. André Schürrle had time and space to pick out Reus, who had no Mainz defenders anywhere near him and gave the visitors the lead."
3',goal,"Goal Marco Reus. GOOOAAALLL! DORTMUND TAKE THE LEAD! It was a simple goal for Marco Reus! Andre Schurrle broke with the ball on the half-way line, nicking the ball off Gbamin, he then played an inch-perfect ball into the path of Reus on the left flank who was completely unmarked. Reus then slotted the ball with ease into the back of the net. Shocking defending from Mainz, but the perfect start for Dortmund!"
2',action,"Dortmund could move up to third position in Bundesliga today with a victory, however they are currently 15 points behind the leaders Bayern Munich. Whilst Mainz could move into the top half of the table if they manage to pick up all three points."
