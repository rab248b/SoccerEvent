90',action,There will be a minimum of three minutes added time played here.
88',action,"Looks like the centre-back Sane is now playing upfront alongside Gnabry, using himself as a target man for the long balls forward."
87',action,"Not long to go now. Bremen are starting to throw everyone forward in hope of grabbing an equalising goal, Bayern don't look overly great at the back which is giving the hosts plenty of confidence. However they haven't created a clear-cut chance since the goal by Kruse."
84',action,STAT: Lewandowski has got himself on the scoresheet in four of Bayern’s last five Bundesliga matches – three braces for a total of 7 goals. No chances to speak of for him today though!

79',substitution,Substitution sub-out Franck Bilal Ribéry sub-in Douglas Costa de Souza . Third and final Bayern substitution as Franck Ribéry jogs off to be replaced by Douglas Costa.
76',action,"The pace of the game has slowed down a lot now, Bayern are starting to get a foothold on the ball again and control proceedings after being put under pressure by the hosts for large spells recently. They only have a one-nil advantage and need to be careful here."

52',action,HUGE CHANCE! BREMEN with their best chance of the game! Gnabry turned Hummels on the edge of the box and then fired a powerful shot at goal but it went high over Neuer's goal. If he could've kept his shot down that would've been troubling Neuer!

45',action,"Moisander is penalised for an elbow in the face of Robben, giving Bayern a free-kick in a very dangerous position just on the edge of the box. Plenty of players are around the ball, Robben, Muller, Alaba and Lewandowksi eager to take it."

Excellent finish."
29',action,Another shot at goal by Bremen! This time it is Max Kruse with the chance which forces Neuer to make a more difficult save down to his right.

27',action,"CHANCE BREMEN! Gnabry breaks forward with pace and fires a shot at goal from the edge of the box, however it is straight at Neuer and he comfortably saves. First shot at target for the hosts."
24',action,"Good chance for Bayern! Robben beats a couple of defenders down the right and fires a low cross into the box, however it misses Thomas Muller and Robert Lewandowski, but David Alaba was following up on the edge of the box. However Thomas Delaney was quick to put him under pressure and block the shot from the Bayern defender. Now Bremen can break through Gnabry! However the forward doesn't make his mind up quick enough and Bayern get men behind the ball and clear the danger."
22',action,"It looks like Serge Gnabry is playing a more central role now for Bremen, now that Pizarro has gone off injured, with Max Eggestein playing more on the wing."
20',action,"Bayern are controlling proceedings in the middle of the pitch, but the Bremen defence and midfield are holding a high line and putting pressure on the Bayern midfield at every opportunity which is causing the visitors to make a couple of sloppy errors."
19',substitution,Substitution sub-out Claudio Miguel Pizarro Bossio sub-in Maximilian Eggestein . An early substitution for Bremen with Claudio Pizarro having to come off injured and he is replaced by sub-in Maximilian Eggestein.

15',action,"Another Bremen counter-attack, Junuzovic is the man to win possession and he sprints down the touchline, however his ball into the middle to a teammate is poor and Bayern recovered well to clear the danger."
13',action,"This is a good start from the hosts, they are looking to try and break on the counter-attack as much as they can, as Bayern are enjoying more possession of the ball but haven't threatened the Bremen goal yet."
11',action,Santiago Garcia with an opportunity for Bremen! The hosts did well to work some space in the Bayern half and Zlatko Junuzovic lofted a ball over the head of Mats Hummels which Garcia almost got on the end of. The Bremen man just couldn't reach the ball and Manuel Neuer managed to gather the ball.
10',action,"The visitors could secure their 13th successive Bundesliga win against SVW this weekend, which would represent a new league record for most consecutive wins against a particular side. Impressive."
7',action,"Bayern are controlling the ball at the moment, as you would perhaps expect. However so far they have yet to create any clear chances to open the scoring. The closest they've come is from Ribery's shot a few minutes ago."
5',action,"Franck Ribery with the first shot at goal of the game. The French winger cut in from the left flank and fired a low shot at goal, however it was well saved by Felix Wiedwald who made sure he got all of his body behind the attempt."
4',action,"Early corner here for Bremen, could they nick an early goal? The ball into the box fails to beat the first Bayern defender and then Bremen are caught offside. Bayern immediately set up an attack."
2',action,"Bayern will be expected to win this game as they have the best attack in the Bundesliga, with Bremen having the worst defence in the league! The hosts will need to get off to a good start here today."
