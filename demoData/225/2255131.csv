88',action,SHOT! Robben is desperate to get on the scoresheet as the Dutchman is left with space on the edge of the box but his shot was deflected over the crossbar for a corner.
86',action,"More fluid football from Bayern as Robben and Lewandowski combine well, but a backheel from the latter is unable to find anybody as nobody was in the space that Muller would usually occupy."
84',action,Another corner from the hosts following a dangerous run from Robben is whipped too deep into the box and Danso is able to head the play away from the area.
82',action,It looks as if Muller won't be continuing the rest of the match following the foul from Janker and with Bayern using their final sub a while back they'll be seeing out the match with ten men.
81',yellow-card,Yellow Card Christoph Janker. Janker collects a yellow card.
80',assist,Assist Jérôme Boateng. Great vision from Boateng to find Muller in the box with a lofted pass from the half-way line.

78',action,"CHANCE! Augsburg with their first real opportunity of the match as Max whipped a dangerous free-kick into the box which was met by Danso, but his header was wide of Ulreich's post."
76',action,The atmosphere inside the Allianz Arena has been fantastic this afternoon with the home fans in fine voice as they watch a almost faultless performance from Bayern Munich.
74',action,A bit of shifting in the Bayern team is needed as Rafinha comes on for Hummels and it appears as if it's going to be Kimmich and Boateng working together at the back for the final 15 minutes.
73',substitution,Substitution sub-out Mats Hummels sub-in Márcio Rafael Ferreira de Souza . Bayern's final sub of the match as Rafinha comes on for Hummels.
72',action,"CHANCE! Max is furious at his teammates as Bernat was allowed to overlap and chip a ball into the box, which almost fell to Robben, but the full-back put his body on the line to clear the play."
70',action,Bayern still look so hungry to score more! They're the first to every second ball and continue to press Augsburg players so frantically. A great performance.
68',action,"SHOT! Ji tried his luck from range as Augsburg are allowed the rare opportunity to get up the pitch, but the South Korean's effort is well over Ulreich's crossbar."
66',action,A standing ovation for Thaigo as he comes off the pitch. The midfielder continues to be immaculate for Bayern this season as he's commanded this match for the hosts.
66',substitution,Substitution sub-out Thiago Alcântara do Nascimento sub-in Renato Júnior Luz Sanches . Thiago is awarded a rest as he comes off for Sanches.

62',goal,Goal Thiago Alcântara do Nascimento. GOAL! Thiago makes it four and caps off a fantasic move from Bayern with the Spaniard stabbing home in front of an open goal. It's a riot.
60',action,Augsburg are going to end up conceding more here. They can't get out of their own half and are just allowing wave and wave of attacks from the hosts.
58',action,It's definitely game over in the Allianz Arena now as Bayern cruise through this fixture. The question now is how many will the hosts put past their Bavarian neighbours?
55',assist,Assist Franck Bilal Ribéry. Ribery is credited with the assist as the Frenchman threaded a fantastic pass through to the striker.
55',goal,Goal Robert Lewandowski. GOAL! Bayern extent their lead and it's Lewandowski again! The striker finds space between Danso and Kacar and holds off a tackle from the former to slot home in the bottom corner.
54',action,"CHANCE! Bayern played a patient game on the edge of the Augsburg box and Muller was eventually able to squeeze the ball through to Bernat, but the full-back was unable to control the play in the area."
52',action,"Ulreich gets a rare touch of the ball as Max gets up the left flank and attempts to find Ji in the box with a floated cross, but the Bayern goalkeeper comes out and catches the ball without any problems."
50',action,"Bayern are still in control of the ball in this half, but they're not setting the tempo in the early stages like they did in the first half. The hosts may be looking to cruise through the rest of this match."
48',action,"Two subs from the visitors at half time, which appears to be largely tactical as Baum won't be happy with the first half performance. It seems as if Ji has been trusted with leading the line on his own now."
46',action,Augsburg get the second half underway!
46',substitution,Substitution sub-out Raúl Marcelo Bobadilla sub-in Halil Altıntop . Baum looks to change up his midfield options by bringing on Altintop for Bobadilla.
46',substitution,Substitution sub-out Jan Morávek sub-in Georg Teigl . Teigl comes on for Moravek.
,action,"The half time whistle goes on the 45th minute as Bayern head into the break 2-0 to the good. Normal service has returned in Munich after the international break, but there could be more for the hosts in the second half."
43',action,"SAVE! Hitz was tested by Thiago as the Spaniard skipped past Movarek in midfield to allow himself time to shoot, but the effort was poor and the Augsburg goalkeeper was able to gather with ease."
41',action,"CLOSE! Poetry from Bayern Munich as Ribery threads a delightful pass to Muller, who almost finds Lewandowski with a wonderful backheel, but Kacar does well to put his body on the line and tackle the striker."
38',action,"Augsburg deserve to be two goals behind this afternoon, but it appears they've gone into this match with a defeatist attitude and lethargic pressing to say the least."
36',assist,Assist Robert Lewandowski. Lewandowski turns provider for only the third time this season as the striker is picked out on the right wing to cross into the middle.
36',goal,"Goal Thomas Müller. GOAL! After coming close earlier, Muller gets on the scoresheet as the German international prods home from inside the six-yard box when he's left unmarked from a cross."
34',action,"It's just hopeful long balls! Augsburg are pumping the ball clear in an attempt to find Bobadilla, but with everybody sitting so deep they're unable to find him."
32',action,"Augsburg are still struggling to keep hold of the ball for longer than sixty seconds. Bayern, on the rare occasion they're not in possession, are doing really well to suffocate the away side to control this match."
30',action,"POST! Muller is fed the ball on the edge of the box and the German international shot first time, but a deflection from Kacar took the effort onto the woodwork and it bounced to safety."
28',action,"Augsburg are continuing to sit extremely deep, with everybody including Bobadilla sitting inside the defensive third. It's making life so hard for the vistiors to relieve any pressure."
26',action,"Pinball in the Augsburg box caused chaos for the visitors as legs were flying everywhere, both red and black shirts, and they scrambled to get a touch on the ball, but eventually Kacar got the play clear."
24',action,"Some lovely football on the edge of the Augsburg box between Lewandowski and Muller set-up Thiago for a volley, but the Spaniard hooked his shot wide of Hitz's goal and the away side were allowed to breathe again."
22',action,The story of this match hasn't changed much with Bayern controlling since the goal and look as if they want more. Bernat and Lahm are looking to get forward and support the attack as much as they possibly can.
19',action,"The goal is nothing short of what Bayern have deserved, but the question for Augsburg now is what do they try next? Damage limitation or attack and potentially open yourself up to more."
17',action,Augsburg have their backs to the wall here! The away side are seriously struggling to clear their lines and are just allowing wave after wave of Bayern attack.
17',assist,"Assist Thiago Alcântara do Nascimento. It's Lewandowski's name on the scoresheet, but Thiago should take the plaudits with a wonderful clipped pass into the box to open the opportunity for his teammate."
17',goal,Goal Robert Lewandowski. GOAL! Bayern Munich lead through Lewandowski with a fantastic finish as the Polish striker brought down the play and fired into the top corner from inside the box.
15',action,"Lewandowski thought he had a fantastic opportunity as Thiago clipped a ball into the striker, but Danso did exceptionally well to beat the Polish international to the cross and head the play away."
13',action,"Bayern are playing some neat football this afternoon, but it's largely down to Augsburg refusing to press high and allowing the Bavarians time to move the ball around, which could be a dangerous tactic."
12',yellow-card,Yellow Card Dominik Kohr. Kohr gets the first yellow card of the match.
11',action,"Augsburg get their first sight of goal as Bobadilla won possession in midfield and carried the ball up the pitch to feed Max, but the full-back's shot was tame and Ulreich gathered with ease."
9',action,"First corner of the match goes to Bayern Munich, but as the ball was delivered into the box Hummels is found fouling his marker and Augsburg were awarded a free-kick."
7',action,"Augsburg need to find a way of slowing down the tempo in this game as Bayern attempt to attack the visitors early. However, with the hosts having the majority of possession it's proving difficult for Baum's side."
5',action,"Bayern are already ripping into Augsburg! Ribery skipped down the left wing and twisted Danso inside out to cross to the back post, but unfortunately for the Frenchman he was unable to find Coman."
3',action,"Early chance for Bayern as Kimmich whipped a deep free-kick into the box to find Hummels, who was able to peel off his marker, but as the defender headed back across goal he was unable to find a red shirt."
1',action,Bayern get the match underway!
,action,"Meanwhile, shifting to a more defensive starting eleven, Baum has made six changes after his side drew 1-1 with Freiburg in their previous fixture in an attempt to stop the might of Bayern Munich!"
,action,"Carlo Ancelotti’s hand may have been forced when giving Sven Ulreich the start over Manuel Neuer this afternoon, but despite this the Italian has opted for five changes to the starting line-up after their 1-0 victory over Borussia Monchengladbach."
