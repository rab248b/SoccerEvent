,action,"FULL-TIME! Real Madrid take a huge three points on the road in LaLiga, courtesy of a 4-1 demolition of Eibar, which saw the away side dominate the first half and put their slow-starting opponents to the sword. Goals from Benzema, James and Asensio did the trick for Zidane's men, with Ruben Pena netting a late consolation goal after a bit of a resurgence from the home side. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+1',action,There are two minutes of stoppage time.
89',action,"Kovacic is allowed to burst into the Eibar penalty area and try to work an opportunity to shoot, but Rivera tracks back to deny the Croatian and steer him away from the danger zone. The Real Madrid substitute goes down and asks about a penalty, but Ramis is having none of it."
87',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Pedro León Sánchez Gil sub-in Takashi Inui . Inui is introduced for the last few minutes at Ipurua, with Pedro Leon replaced after a bright second half."
86',action,"Sergi Enrich tries his luck from just inside the penalty area, after more good work down the right from Pedro Leon, but Pepe puts enough pressure on the Eibar striker to force him to lash a poor effort over the crossbar!"
85',action,"Nacho is released to the left byline and lofts a cross over to Lucas Vazquez, but the latter takes a poor touch and is robbed of possession on the edge of the box. Real Madrid continue to put pressure on down the right, but Arbilla gets across well to slide in and make a great tackle."
83',action,"Eibar slowly work their way down the left-hand side, with a good cross from Arbilla hacked away acrobatically by Pepe. The substitute goes down with an injury problem in the aftermath, due to being caught late by Danilo late, but is fine to continue. The Brazilian right-back has got away with one there."
81',action,"We're into the final 10 minutes at Ipurua, with Real Madrid happy to see out this 4-1 scoreline. Mariano Diaz threatens to hurtle down the left-hand side and get in behind the Eibar back four, but Dos Santos marshals the powerful youngster well and then sprays a pass over to Ramis."
79',action,"Pedro Leon is picked out on the right-hand side and brings the ball down wonderfully, but a left-footed cross from the winger isn't capitalised upon by Escalante nor Enrich. Eibar win a corner on the same flank moments later, but Sergio Ramos does well to rise high and flick a defensive header away. Real Madrid clear their lines effectively."
77',action,"Eibar keep possession and stroke the ball around, as they search for further goals. The home fans were initially buoyed by that Ruben Pena goal, but the atmosphere has since waned again. Mendilibar's men need to up the tempo and really force Real Madrid onto the back foot."
75',substitution,"Substitution sub-out James David Rodríguez Rubio sub-in Francisco Román Alarcón Suárez . James takes his leave, with Isco coming into the game to offer some fresh midfield legs for the dying stages."
74',action,"Mariano Diaz meets a delivery from the left-hand side, but the Real Madrid substitute can only send his header shy of the far post. Despite having a three-goal lead, Zidane's men are still keeping a competitive amount of forward players occupying advanced areas of the field."
72',goal,"Goal Rubén Peña Jiménez. GOOOOOOOOOOAL! RUBEN PENA MAKES IT 4-1! The Eibar winger has been a threat from the left in the last 20 minutes, and has his goal. Pedro Leon whips in a cross from the right, and his teammate is able to cushion an excellent finish back across the target and inside the far post."
72',assist,Assist Pedro León Sánchez Gil. Assist Pedro León Sánchez Gil
72',assist,"Assist Pedro León Sánchez Gil. Pedro Leon shakes off Nacho to whip a cross in, but there were definitely solid claims for the ex-Getafe wide man to have done so illegally, catching the Real Madrid defender in the face."
71',substitution,Substitution sub-out Luka Modrić sub-in Mateo Kovačić . Kovacic replaces Modric in the centre of midfield for the last 20 minutes or so.
70',action,"Eibar are growing in confidence, but not in quality. Capa shoots from range and balloons the ball into the stands behind Navas' goal. Sergi Enrich flicks the ball out to the right-hand side, but an eventual cross from Pedro Leon swerves violently into the side netting at the near post. The Real Madrid goalkeeper was worried there for a second."
68',action,"OFFSIDE! Eibar win themselves a corner on the left-hand side, which is whipped into the box and causing all kinds of problems. Sergi Enrich meets the delivery at the near post and forces a save out of Navas, with Escalante following up to tuck the ball home. The linesman's flag, however, is raised."
66',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Karim Benzema sub-in Mariano Díaz Mejía . Benzema is given a well-earned rest and won't get himself a hat-trick today, with Mariano Diaz given a chance to prove himself."
64',action,"Good cross from Arbilla! The substitute curls in a delivery from wide on the left-hand side, but Sergi Enrich can't quite stretch enough to steer home a first-touch finish. Instead, the ball flashes across the danger zone and wide of the target."
63',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Adrián González Morales sub-in Christian Rivera Hernández . Adrian takes his leave after a very quiet game, with Christian Rivera introduced."
62',yellow-card,"Yellow Card José Ignacio Fernández Iglesias. Nacho gets a yellow card for the away side, after cynically committing a foul to prevent an Eibar counter-attack."
62',action,"Less than half an hour remains, and Real Madrid are in total control. Zidane's men are sat back in numbers, essentially having a rest, and Pepe is putting in a much-improved performance at centre-back. Capa tries to cut infield from the right and shoot, but the Eibar full-back runs into traffic. The visitors counter, but Ramis does well to deny Benzema."
60',goal,"Goal Marco Asensio Willemsen. GOOOOOOOAL! ASENSIO MAKES IT FOUR! Capa tries to flight in a cross from the right-hand side, but Pepe clears, with Real Madrid then countering at pace. Asensio feeds James, who strikes the post with an initial effort, but the youngster gets onto the rebound and steers a great finish inside the far post. That is the three points wrapped up for Los Blancos, if it wasn't evident already."
59',action,"Arbilla tries to whip in a cross from deep on the left flank, but Real Madrid clear with ease. Eibar just can't seem to test Navas since the restart and their lead is looking well-protected with around half an hour left to play. The home fans aren't making much noise, as this game is threatening to peter out uneventfully."
57',action,"This second half is yet to burst into life, with Real Madrid perfectly happy to quietly see this one out. The away side get themselves a corner out on the right-hand side, but James' delivery is cleared. The referee pulls back play, too, as Sergio Ramos is penalised for climbing on Escalante."
55',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Antonio Manuel Luna Rodríguez sub-in Anaitz Arbilla Zabala . Arbilla replaces Luna at left-back for the home side, after the latter turned his ankle nastily in an innocuous coming together with Modric."
55',action,"Real Madrid are keeping men behind the ball and they look to be easing their way towards the last half an hour at Ipurua with consummate ease. Eibar have had a little more possession since the restart. Pepe makes a good near-post header to deny Enrich, after a cross from the left by Ruben Pena. Luna isn't moving comfortably."
53',action,"Benzema is found by a quick ball in behind the Eibar back four, but Yoel is very alert to come off his line and gobble the pass up. The hosts break down the right, with Pedro Leon picking out Ruben Pena at the back post, but Danilo makes a fantastic block to deny the Spanish winger. Real Madrid respond with a counter of their own, but Asensio is tackled well by Capa."
51',action,"Real Madrid are still looking comfortable in this contest, with Eibar not quite flying out of the traps in the second half. Escalante feeds Adrian at the edge of the box, but the hosts' attacking midfielder has the ball stolen off his toes while trying to find a shooting angle. Zidane won't want his players to overexpose themselves and make any mistakes."
49',action,"Wide from Benzema! Nacho manages to nod a header into the Eibar penalty area, which the Frenchman gets onto in a flash. He reacts quicker than Dos Santos and shoots from a tight angle, but he can only drag an attempt narrowly beyond the far post."
47',action,"There is a stoppage in play, as Luna goes down off the ball with an injury problem. Real Madrid sportingly put the ball out of play, given the scoreline. Sergi Enrich uses the time to argue with the referee."
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half in the Basque Country! Eibar need to put in quite a showing to even have a chance of sharing the spoils this afternoon, but Real Madrid have proved recently that the seemingly impossible is achievable."
,action,"HALF-TIME! Real Madrid head into the break with a 3-0 advantage over Eibar, courtesy of a brace from Benzema and a neat finish from James. The hosts just haven't really responded and look jaded, with a rotated line-up from Zidane looking to be more than capable of getting the job done this afternoon."
44',action,"Benzema and Asensio both go close from inside the box, as Real Madrid try and put this game beyond any reasonable doubt. Mendilibar's men are going to need a gargantuan second-half performance to turn this contest on its head. Eibar are leaving a lot of space in between the lines for the likes of James and Asensio to exploit."
42',action,"Sergio Ramos makes a good challenge to deny Escalante, with the Eibar midfielder having to watch his step after picking up that earlier booking. Moments later, Eibar threaten down the left with Pedro Leon, but Nacho makes a great intervention inside his own penalty area. Real Madrid counter, with the move ending with Asensio shooting just wide of the post from 20 yards out."
40',action,"Good block from Sergio Ramos! Capa drives down the right and whips in a dangerous cross, which is nodded down to Sergi Enrich. The Spanish striker shoots from close-range, but Navas and his centre-back rush out to narrow the angle and the latter makes the required intervention. That is as close as Eibar have come. Moments later, Ruben Pena whips in a cross from the left, but Danilo makes a block. The resulting corner is claimed by Navas."
38',action,"Real Madrid are looking in total control, with Eibar not managing to force the same amount of mistakes as they could in the first five or 10 minutes. The hosts enjoy a very slow spell of possession, with Los Blancos seemingly happy to sit in and have a bit of a rest until the half-time break. Only Benzema is being left high upfield."
36',action,"Escalante drives into some space and shoots from 30 yards out, but the Argentine midfielder balloons an awful effort a long way over the crossbar. That is about as close as Eibar have come inside this first half. Zidane will be overjoyed that his players have managed to keep an in-form side very quiet and subdued indeed."
34',action,"Eibar just can't seem to hold onto the ball for more than three or four passes, with the home side completely on the ropes at Ipurua. Real Madrid are moving possession with purpose and confidence. Danilo tries his luck from long-range, after marauding forward from right-back, but the Brazilian defender drags a terrible effort a long way wide of the right-hand post."
32',yellow-card,Yellow Card Gonzalo Escalante. Escalante gets a yellow card for diving into a poorly-timed tackle on Casemiro.
31',action,"Eibar are really struggling to get into this game, with Real Madrid looking in total control. It would be interesting to be a fly on the wall in the home side's dressing room at the interval. Zidane's men are causing problems on the break, with Luna gifting possession away this time. Asensio dances beyond two players, before slipping over and surrendering the ball to Capa."
29',assist,"Assist Karim Benzema. Benzema drives down the right and cuts a good ball across into the penalty area, allowing for James to take his first-time shot in his stride."
29',goal,"Goal James David Rodríguez Rubio. GOOOOOOOOOOAL! JAMES MAKES IT THREE! Benzema gets himself an assist with a neat ball from the right-hand side, as Real Madrid stream forward well on the counter-attack. James stabs a wonderful finish into the top-left corner, on the slide, but once again Eibar's marking leaves something to be desired."
28',action,"Eibar go close! Pedro Leon dips in a fantastic free-kick delivery from the left-hand side, but Sergi Enrich is penalised for challenging unfairly with Navas at the back post. Just as it appeared that the Spanish striker would be able to test the Real Madrid goalkeeper, the referee pulls play back for a shove."
27',action,"Benzema has two goals to his name and Zidane will be pleased. It appears that the away side won't need to chase a league contest for the first time in a while. Eibar aren't generating any chances and their fans are starting to grumble a little. Mendilibar will be furious, his team need waking up, and fast. Real Madrid could make this embarrassing."
25',assist,"Assist James David Rodríguez Rubio. James bends in a tantalising free-kick delivery, which seems to confuse the home defence entirely."
25',goal,"Goal Karim Benzema. GOOOOOOOOAL! BENZEMA MAKES IT TWO! James whips in a devilish free-kick delivery from the right-hand side, with his left foot swinging the ball into a dangerous area at the back post. Eibar are left standing, with Benzema reacting well to stab home a close-range finish. That is absolutely terrible defending from the hosts."
23',action,"Real Madrid earn themselves a corner on the left-hand side, but it doesn't clear the first man. James tries to whip in a second delivery from the same wing, but Pedro Leon charges this one down instead. The away side are having quite a lot of the ball, and are slowly starting to control affairs in midfield."
21',action,"Casemiro meets a set-piece delivery from the right-hand side, but the Brazilian midfielder flicks a header harmlessly wide of the target. Real Madrid are settling down and looking quite comfortable so far, with Eibar unable to get Sergi Enrich having a big impact up front. The Spaniard is not getting the service required to cause Sergio Ramos and Pepe problems."
19',action,"Lucas Vazquez is the recipient of a quick lofted ball out to the right-hand side, but the Spaniard can't quite pull the pass out of the air after threatening to get behind Luna. Eibar drive down the left, with Ruben Pena getting to use his pace, but Casemiro shuffles across to tackle the hosts' winger."
17',action,"Real Madrid will be buoyed massively by that opening goal, as Los Blancos have been accused of starting matches poorly in LaLiga recently. Eibar are still looking to commit players forward to press and counter at pace, but they are definitely leaving space to be exploited on the break. Asensio will look to have further influence from the left wing."
15',action,"Another big chance for Real Madrid! Benzema cuts in a cross from the right byline, with Asensio and Nacho unable to capitalise at the back post due to an interception from Dos Santos. Yoel then pounces on the loose ball quickly. Eibar are rocking here a little."
14',goal,"Goal Karim Benzema. GOOOOOOOOOAL! BENZEMA MAKES IT 1-0! Asensio flashes a wonderful ball across the face of goal from the left-hand side, with the Frenchman able to try his luck first-time at the back post. Yoel makes a good initial save, but parries the ball directly to the Real Madrid striker. He tucks home the rebound easily."
13',action,"Capa gifts possession away to Modric, but Real Madrid are pressed well and lose possession on the counter. Pedro Leon attempts to burst down the right, but James tracks back neatly to help out Nacho. End-to-end stuff, but with no real cutting edge or quality in the final third."
12',action,"A couple of scrappy tackles break up the flow of play, with Eibar getting the opportunity to lift some free-kick deliveries into the box. This time, Dos Santos manages to flick it on, but the hosts' centre-back's header sails harmlessly wide of the target. Mendilibar, who is watching this game from the stands due to a touchline ban, will be hoping his players can make a little more of good set-piece situations."
10',action,"Eibar have tried to press and prevent Real Madrid from easing their way into the midfield third, and it is working thus far. Pepe is pressured, this time by Enrich, and a block from the lone striker heads out for a throw-in. If the away side can break the hosts' lines, then a lot of space could potentially open up on the counter. Zidane's side are playing very cautiously."
8',action,"Benzema is picked out on the left-hand side and battles his way into the box, but Dos Santos covers across and outmuscles his man to shepherd the ball out of play. Neither goalkeeper has had anything to do yet, with this contest not threatening to settle down any time soon. Ruben Pena jinks into the area at the other end, but Pepe makes a sliding block to deny a shot from the Eibar winger."
6',action,"Pedro Leon pumps a long ball into the penalty area, but Ramis is beaten aerially by Pepe. The away side respond with a counter-attack down the other end, with Lucas Vazquez picked out on the right flank, but the Spanish winger can't prevent the ball from rolling out of play for a throw-in. James is finding a bit of space in between the lines, but Eibar look as though they can press high and frustrate Los Blancos."
4',action,"The hosts are looking to pressure and harry their opponents, with Vazquez and Asensio being asked to track back quite a bit. Enrich tries to cut infield from the left to work a shooting angle, but Sergio Ramos hoofs clear. Real Madrid definitely don't look composed, with their recent form evidently having an effect on their confidence."
2',action,"Great tackle from Capa! Real Madrid work the ball from right to left, with Danilo doing well with some interplay on the edge of the penalty area. Benzema is fed into the box neatly, but the Frenchman is robbed of the ball as he attempts to get it onto his stronger foot. Bright stuff from the visitors."
1',action,"We are underway in the first half at Ipurua! Real Madrid are in need of three points to keep themselves as favourites for the LaLiga title, but Eibar have been turning in some impressive home performances of late. An upset could be on the cards this afternoon."

,action,"TEAM NEWS: Gareth Bale and Alvaro Morata are suspended for Real Madrid, which means that Karim Benzema and Lucas Vazquez start in attack. Cristiano Ronaldo didn't travel with the squad due to an injury problem, which gives a rare start to young Marco Asensio. Luka Modric and James Rodriguez flank Casemiro in midfield, with Nacho and Danilo deployed in at full-back for the visitors. With Raphael Varane still struggling with an injury, Pepe continues to be his most regular deputy at centre-back. Keylor Navas retains his place in goal."
,action,"TEAM NEWS: Florian Lejeune misses out due to suspension for Eibar, which will see Mauro Dos Santos and Ivan Ramis make up an unfamilar partnership in the heart of the defence. Ander Capa is back from suspension and starts at right-back, with Ruben Pena preferred to Takashi Inui out on the left-hand side. Pedro Leon is on the other flank and has been in hot form of late, with Sergi Enrich leading the line. Fran Rico misses out due to injury, with Asier Riesgo fit enough for the bench."
,action,"Eibar are unbeaten in their last four LaLiga matches, and have scored 12 goals during that same period, with Sergi Enrich being the man to stop up front. Real Madrid, meanwhile, fought back to a 3-3 draw with Las Palmas midweek, after almost losing to Villarreal on the road last Sunday. Testing times for Zidane and company, and they've got plenty of absentees for today's fixture."
,action,"Hello and welcome to live coverage of Real Madrid's tough away trip to Ipurua this afternoon, as Zinedine Zidane's men are hosted by Eibar. Recently Los Blancos have been scraping results and dropping points in the title race over the last two weeks, which has led to them sinking down to second place in the table with a game in hand. The hosts, meanwhile, are very good in front of their own fans and will be confident of pulling off an upset."
