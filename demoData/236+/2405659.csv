,action,"That's all from me today,  I hope you've enjoyed today's action!"
,action,"A spirited Oxford side fought back from two goals down to go level with Premier League outfit Middlesbrough,  but a late Christian Stuani goal left the visitors FA Cup dream in tatters. First-half goals from Leadbitter and Gestede gave Boro a healthy lead, but Oxford came back strong to level the score. A Chris Maguire free-kick was followed rapidly by a Toni Martinez goal and all of a sudden the picture had changed. It was not to be a fairytale ending for Michael Appleton's men though, as Christian Stuani's 87th minute goal assured Middlesbrough a place in the quarter-finals."
,action,FULL TIME: Middlesbrough 3-2 Oxford United
90'+4',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Marvin Johnson. It is all falling apart a bit now, as Johnson picks up a daft yellow card after throwing the ball at Chambers."
90'+2',yellow-card,Yellow Card Álvaro Negredo Sánchez. A nasty hack at Dunkley from Negredo puts the substitute in the referee's book.

85',action,"CHANCE! Sercombe makes an immediate impact, winning a flick-on to release McAleny. The Everton loanee miscues his strike though and Boro survive another scare."

82',action,Guzan collects the corner with ease and releases Ramirez with a long kick. The Uruguayan is matched stride for stride by the covering Johnson though and the Oxford man regains possession before winning a free-kick.
81',action,"Neither side looks to fancy a replay here, and Oxford look the more likely at the moment. McAleny drags Espinosa wide and wins a corner."
78',action,Oxford fly forwards on the counter-attack as Johnson delivers a fizzing cross. Chambers gets in ahead of McAleny but slices the ball nervously over his own bar and out for a corner.
77',action,"Clayton whips in a corner and Ayala attempts to flick the ball on, but only succeeds in finding Eastwood between the sticks."
76',yellow-card,Yellow Card Ryan Ledson. Ryan  becomes the first Oxford player to be yellow carded for a petulant pull back.
73',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Viktor Fischer sub-in Gastón Exequiel Ramírez Pereyra . Traore is swiftly followed down the tunnel by sub-out Viktor Fischer who makes way for Gaston Ramirez, making his first appearance for Boro since handing in a transfer request in January."
72',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Adama Traoré Diarra sub-in Cristhian Ricardo Stuani Curbelo . A double change for the hosts, with Traore replaced by Christian Stuani first."
71',yellow-card,Yellow Card Calum Chambers. A late challenge from Chambers sees the Arsenal loanee go into the book.
69',action,"PENALTY APPEAL TURNED DOWN! Now it's Boro that fly forwards, as Downing gets beyond Edwards and is hauled to the ground. Marriner is not interested though and Oxford get away with it."
67',substitution,Substitution sub-out Kane Hemmings sub-in Conor McAleny . sub-in Conor McAleny replaces sub-out Kane Hemmings as Oxford look to capitalise on their momentum.
65',goal,Goal Antonio Martínez López. GOAALLL! UNBELIEVABLE SCENES! Oxford have turned this around in the blink of an eye! After Boro lose possession from the kick-off Oxford pounce and fly forwards. After Guzan saves from Maguire's low shot the ball drops to West Ham loanee Martinez who makes no mistake in tapping into an empty net. Game on!
64',goal,Goal Chris Maguire. GOAL! CHRIS MAGUIRE GOES FROM ZERO TO HERO! A well placed free-kick loops over the wall and beats Brad Guzan to put the visitors back in the game.
63',action,"Free-kick in a fantastic position for Oxford, as the League 1 side begin to rally here. Traore is the perpetrator as he knocks Edwards to the ground."
62',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Daniel Sanchez Ayala. The former Liverpool defender crashes into the back of Martinez sending the 19-year-old sprawling, and is correctly put into the book."
60',action,"Traore is causing more problems as the game draws on. He once again beats his man and delivers a cross that hits Chey Dunkley. There are some half-hearted appeals for a handball, but Andre Marriner is not interested."
58',action,"CHANCE! Oxford come close as a nicely delivered ball finds its way through to Martinez, he connects well but Guzan is on hand to tip the ball out for a corner."
56',action,Boro concede a free-kick close to the by-line as Espinosa crashes into the back of Hemmings. The ball is whipped in and Dunkley crumples in the box under pressure from Ayala. The muted penalty claims are waved away and the ball is cleared for another corner.

51',action,"The last time these teams faced off was back in 1998, when Middlesbrough ran out 4-1 in a second tier clash. Karanka's side look increasingly like repeating that kind of scoreline as the visitors appear to be tiring."
49',action,Fischer breaks forward and finds Downing who draws a good save from Eastwood. Looks like we are set for another end-to-end half.
46',action,It's an electric start to the second-half for Oxford as Johnson bursts down the left before whipping in his cross. Ayala clears but it's an early test for Boro.
,action,"It has been a good day for the little guy elsewhere in the FA Cup today, but Oxford have come up against a well drilled Middlesbrough side today. Michael Appleton's men started very brightly and had Martinez capitalised on a one-on-one chance the story may have been different. Since then Boro have shown their class, and after Grant Leadbitter opened the scoring from the penalty spot, Rudy Gestede doubled the lead with an impressive overhead kick."

37',action,SAVE! A very good save from Eastwood who is keeping the visitors in the game here. Fischer drives to the by-line and pulls the ball back to Downing. His side foot shot is destined for the bottom corner before the Oxford keeper shows his agility to leap across his goal and tip it wide.
34',goal,Goal Rudy Gestede. GOAL!!! AN OVERHEAD KICK FROM GESTEDE! The big striker finishes spectacularly after Oxford failed to clear their lines from a Fabio cross. The ball makes its way through to Traore who knocks it back to Gestede who lashes the ball past Eastwood with a bicycle kick.
33',action,CLOSE! Boro fly back down the other end of the pitch and find Downing on the edge of the box. He lets off a ferocious strike and draws a good save from Eastwood.
32',action,"DISALLOWED GOAL! A big call from the referee as he rules out a Chris Maguire equaliser. The midfielder's cross went all the way through and past Guzan, but a shove on Daniel Ayala from Kane Hemmings sees Mariner award a free-kick to Middlesbrough."
30',action,"The visitors are looking for a response, but Maguire's whipped corner causes no problems for Guzan who collects with ease."
28',action,"Adama Traore has proved a handful for defenders across the Premier League, but Oxford's Curtis Nelson is dealing well with the former Barcelona man, as he ushers Traore out of play for a goal-kick once again."

18',action,"Adama Traore whips the ball in deep and finds the head of Fischer, but the winger is penalised for a shove on Oxford right-back Phil Edwards."
16',action,"Fischer again proves instrumental as Middlesbrough attack. The Dane plays a nicely disguised pass into Gestede, who sees his shot blocked. The ball falls to Callum Chambers 30 yards out and the defender's low strike draws a save from Oxford stopper Eastwood."
14',action,"Oxford have only won away to Premier League opposition once in the FA Cup, back in 1994 against Leeds United, but they are giving Boro a really good game here."

6',action,"Boro are piling on the pressure now, and two Oxford defenders are required to block a Viktor Fischer strike from close range. It’s all been quite frantic so far."
5',action,"SAVE - Oxford are lucky here, as Grant Leadbitter's free-kick finds Gestede totally unmarked at the far post. Gestede fails to connect properly though and provides Simon Eastwood with an easy catch."
4',action,Stewart Downing floats in a cross from the left looking for the run of Rudy Gestede who provides a significant aerial threat. The Middlesbrough striker is unable to connect on this occasion though and Oxford clear their lines.
2',action,"CHANCE! A REAL WARNING FOR BORO THERE! Antonio Martinez latches onto a long ball and nods the ball past Ben Gibson to give himself a one-on-one with Brad Guzan. The Oxford striker mishits his shot, but Guzan is far from reassuring and just about manages to scramble the ball wide for a corner."
