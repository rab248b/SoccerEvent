,action,"Well that's not something you would have seen coming in the summer, but the Seattle Sounders have come all the way back from the depths of the table to top the Western Conference. One half of the MLS Cup final is set. Montreal and Toronto will decide the other half. If Toronto advances the game will happen in Canada. Should Montreal hang on, Seattle will host."
90'+5',action,THERE IT IS!! Seattle will be playing for the MLS Cup title!
90'+4',action,"Doyle with a flashed header, but it well, well wide of the mark. Seattle is about to advance to the MLS Cup final."
90'+3',action,One last push from Colorado? It's blocked away for a throw. This is all but done now.
90'+2',action,Seattle players are starting to feel it on the sidelines. Four minutes added on and we're over a minute gone of that.
90',action,Colorado just lumping the ball forward. No other way it seems. Nothing coming of it at all. And now the Rapids have given away a foul in their own end. Another chance for the Sounders to kill some clock.
88',substitution,Substitution sub-out Nelson Antonio Haedo Valdez sub-in Zach Scott . Substitution  sub-out Nelson Antonio Haedo Valdez sub-in Zach Scott
88',action,Valdez comes off for Scott. Seattle tossing on another defender.
87',action,Colorado just throwing numbers forward. They've got to come up with something soon.
85',substitution,Substitution sub-out Shkëlzen Taib Gashi sub-in Dominique Badji . Substitution  sub-out Shkëlzen Taib Gashi sub-in Dominique Badji
85',action,"The last toss of the dice for Colorado will be Badji for Gashi. This seems late for bringing Badji on, and taking Gashi off with what he can bring seems strange as well."
84',action,Another cross from the left for Colorado is cut out by Seattle.
81',action,"Colorado in down the left with but the cross is blocked away. Seattle has had trouble getting it cleared so far, but is surviving without really giving up many chances here."
79',action,Colorado fighting hard for the ball at the top of the Seattle box. Seattle doing all it can to get the ball clear.
78',action,It's into the wall.
77',action,"Colorado gets the ball recycled and floated back in, and this time Jones is fouled near the top of the box. Another big moment in this game. Gashi and Jones both line up over it."
76',action,Colorado wins a free kick. Gashi with a chance to serve it in. Jones waving his hands trying to get the crowd into it. Frei comes out to tap it away but looked less than sure of his touch.
75',action,Fisher comes on for Alonso. That's a big loss for Seattle. Certainly a blow to the defensive core of the team.
74',substitution,Substitution sub-out Osvaldo Alonso Moreno sub-in Oniel David Fisher . Substitution  sub-out Osvaldo Alonso Moreno sub-in Oniel David Fisher
73',substitution,Substitution sub-out Micheal Azira sub-in Marco Pablo Pappa Ponce . Substitution  sub-out Micheal Azira sub-in Marco Pablo Pappa Ponce
73',action,"Alonso came back on, but he may well be subbed off here. He's down on the pitch again. Pappa will in fact come on for Colorado. Waiting to see what the change might be for Seattle."
72',action,"Morris cuts to the line after being played in but had his attempted pass cut out. Seattle still on the front foot here. In fact, you'd almost argue that the run of play has swung more in favor of the Sounders since the goal. Not sitting back by any means."
71',action,"Fernandez is fouled as he breaks forward. Colorado hanging on a bit now, trying to figure out if there's a way back into this."
70',action,"Alonso is ushered off the field to get his treatment, so Colorado has a momentary man advantage."
69',action,"Alonso down on the field after a little clash. He'll get some treatment, and you can expect Seattle to take its time with everything from here on out. A two-goal lead in the tie with a trip to the MLS Cup final on the line."
68',yellow-card,Yellow Card Marc Burch. Yellow card Marc Burch
66',action,"Big moment where Marshall has a ball hit his arm in the box. Was there any intent? The ref says no and we play on, but the home fans and players are not happy about it at all."
65',action,"Roldan with a long run forward for Seattle. He cut to the line and tried to pull it back, but MacMath smothers it and pops up to try and spring the Rapids on a counter."
64',action,Good work from Jones and Harriston to earn Colorado a chance. Jones with a shot blocked and Harriston with some hard work to win it back off of Seattle's Jones in a 50-50. The cross was right at Frei or Colorado may have been back in it.
62',action,Good ball in from the left for Colorado but Jones was there to cut it out for Seattle. Morris gets on the ball again and breaks forward down the left but Colorado is there to cover it up.
60',action,Morris now asked to track back to defend Miller. He did well too.
59',substitution,Substitution sub-out Sébastien Le Toux sub-in Marlon Hairston . Substitution  sub-out Sébastien Le Toux sub-in Marlon Hairston
59',action,"Here comes Harriston for the Rapids, replacing Le Toux. It looks like Morris will also soldier on for Seattle."
57',action,"He may have injured himself on the goal, but Valdez slipped Morris in down the channel and he lays down to clip it over MacMath and in! That makes the job really, really tough for the Rapids, who now need to find two goals in just over half an hour to get back level."
56',assist,Assist Nelson Antonio Haedo Valdez. Assist Nelson Antonio Haedo Valdez
56',goal,Goal Jordan Morris. Goal Jordan Morris
56',action,MORRIS!!! It's 1-0 to Seattle!
53',action,Let Toux gets in a cross from the left side that is deflected into the arms of Frei. Both teams really struggling to open up any good chances. I guess this is what we all should have expected given Colorado's record at home.
51',substitution,Substitution sub-out Andreas Ivanschitz sub-in Álvaro Fernández Gay . Substitution  sub-out Andreas Ivanschitz sub-in Álvaro Fernández Gay
51',action,"Fernandez will come on for Ivanschitz in the first change of the game for either side, so while nothing swapped at halftime it looks as though Seattle might have had an issue they wanted a quick look at."
49',action,Morris with a solid break forward. Plays the ball into Valdez who tries to turn and hit but sends it wide.
47',action,No changes at the break which means both teams come back out with their full teams. Jones has won an early corner for Colorado.
46',action,Here we go with the second half.
,action,"That's all for the first 45. Colorado has certainly been the better side, but Seattle will be happy with it being 0-0 at the break. We're set up for a thrilling second half so stick around."
45'+2',action,Mears tries to whip in a cross with his left foot but Colorado cuts it out and heads the other way on the counter. Seattle deals with that danger and the first half comes to an end.
45'+1',action,One minute added on for stoppage in the first half. Most of that will be killed off with a foul in midfield on Roldan.
42',action,Morris working hard and nearly injured himself chasing down a lost cause. His foot stuck in the ground going up against Watts.
41',action,The initial shot hit the wall from Gashi and Powers sent the follow up wide. Disappointing for the home side there.
39',action,"Late whistle. Foul goes against the Sounders as Mears barges in on Jones. Good spot for a shot here really, and with Jones and Gashi the Rapids have guys who can hit them."
36',action,"Gashi gets called for the foul in Seattle's box. The official says he undercut Torres as he backed into the defender, who was up to try and win a header."
35',action,"Morris with a good break forward and chooses to play in Ivanschitz, who hit a poor ball back across goal looking for Valdez. Best attacking move of the day for the Sounders."
32',action,"Really good service from Jones for Colorado. A little clipped ball picked out Gashi who went for the spectacular finish and got it all wrong. In fairness, Gashi has the spectacular in him."
31',action,"Just over half an hour in and we are as we started. The Rapids have certainly shown better energy and have pressed the Sounders into some big issues moving the ball, but neither side has shown a ton of quality in the attacking third."
29',action,Jermaine Jones got caught in the face with a ball off the back of Roldan's head. It was enough to knock him down for a minute.
26',action,"Keep in mind, this is a Colorado team that doesn't give up goals at home and only needs a 1-0 win."
25',action,"From another corner, another BIG chance for Colorado. Frei comes out, slips a bit and just touches the ball. Jones tries to flick it back over his head on goal but sends it just up over the bar. Seattle has been living dangerously."
24',action,Oh Kevin Doyle... what a chance he had to put the ball into Le Toux. Torres just completely mis-played a ball at the back and let Doyle in on the left. All he had to do was square it to Le Toux who was alone on the doorstep. Instead he played it out in front and Le Toux did not react well.
22',action,"Colorado has really come out an put together a nice first half so far. The only big chances have come from corners, but the run of play has been all in favor of the home side. They've kept Seattle very much in check and done plenty of attacking, though the Rapids still seem very limited up front."
19',action,Gashi just flat hit his teammate Jones in the back with a pass. He had to give up a foul on Lodeiro to keep Seattle from getting on the counter.
16',action,"Alonso in with another hard tackle on Jones, who is playing a more advanced role today for Colorado. Seattle takes that and finally puts together a short spell on the ball."
14',yellow-card,Yellow Card Román Aureliano Torres Morcillo. Yellow card Román Aureliano Torres Morcillo
13',action,"Morris flashed his speed to get in there and won a corner for Seattle, but the Sounders are forced to foul to slow a potential counter. Then Torres walks in front of the quick re-start. Card comes out for Torres."
12',action,Colorado has really dominated the opening run of play here. Nothing for Valdez or Lodeiro up front for Seattle. Morris has not looked great on his few touches. It'll be interesting to see how the teams adjust over the next few minutes. This is not a Seattle team that is accustomed to not having the ball.
9',action,"Good service in, driven ball, but it gets all the way across the face of goal without a touch."
8',action,Jones and Alonso are going at it early on. A hard foul from Alonso here gives Gashi a chance to deliver from the left side of the box. Not a good foul there.
7',action,Le Toux hits the ground from what seemed like an Alonso elbow maybe. Just a hand up as the two worked for position from a throw.
5',action,Jovin Jones with a mistake at the back for Seattle. He had the ball taken off him but recovered to block the shot. Colorado with an early corner and Gashi found Powers who flashed it just wide.
4',action,The Rapids are putting on the early pressure. Seattle hasn't given up anything dangerous so far.
1',action,"Seattle in the rave green kit today, with Colorado in the burgandy.... And Jones takes an early hit for the Rapids. He's been known to do that."
1',action,Here we go! Colorado hosting Seattle with a spot in the MLS Cup final on the line!
,action,"News coming out that Jordan Morris has been sick for the last few days. That could be something to keep an eye on for Seattle. He's in the lineup, but at altitude, not feeling well already - if he can't go the options are somewhat limited for the Sounders in the attack."
,action,"It's been a strange season for both of these clubs really. For Colorado, in some ways, this team was the shock of the year. A strong start to the season and the club never really faded. A good defensive unit has kept them in most matches and has allowed only seven goals at home all year. For Seattle a very slow start after selling Obafemi Martins just before opening day and then Dempsey's health issues had th Sounders looking down and out during the summer. But a coaching change and the addition of Nico Lodeiro has the Sounders rolling right now."
,action,"Both sides come in relatively healthy. Tim Howard and Clint Dempsey are both out of action, but those were both expected long before the lineups were announced today. Dempsey hasn't played since the summer and Howard was injured against Mexico."
,action,"So the situation is simple enough. A 1-0 win or any win by two goals or more would see the Rapids move on to the MLS Cup final. A draw goes in the favor of the Sounders. 2-1 to the Rapids will see overtime, and any other one-goal result favors the Sounders."
,action,"And for Seattle: Frei; J. Jones, Marshall, Torres, Mears; Roldan, Alonso, Ivanschitz, Lodeiro, Morris; Valdez"
,action,"For Colorado today: MacMath; Burch, Sjöberg, Watts, Miller; Powers, Azira; Gashi, Jones, Le Toux; Doyle."
,action,"Hello and welcome in to Goal USA's LIVE call of the Western Conference final second leg. The Colorado Rapids host the match but come in trailing 2-1 after dropping the first leg in Seattle. A 1-0 win would be enough for the home side today, but it's still a tall task against a Seattle team that has been red hot."
