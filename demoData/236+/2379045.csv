,action,"And that will do it! Arsenal are through to the fourth round as another late show sees them snatch victory from the jaws of a replay. Robinson's early goal is long forgotten as Giroud's late strike sends the Gunners into the next stage. Poor Preston gave a great account of themselves but come away with nothing. That's all from us, thanks for tuning in."
90'+4',action,CRACKER! Welbeck strides forward at his own pace before stinging the palms of Maxwell from 20 yards. Xhaka runs out the clock from the resulting corner.
90'+3',action,"Maxwell sees a ball into the box late, and is forced to react quickly to challenge Giroud and prevent him from icing the game with a finish. Arsenal are almost there with the seconds ticking away."
90'+2',substitution,Substitution sub-out Ainsley Maitland-Niles sub-in Rob Holding . Another late Wenger change as Maitland-Niles departs for Holding.
90'+2',substitution,Substitution sub-out Lucas Pérez Martínez sub-in Jeff Reine-Adelaide . Lucas goes off for sub-in Jeff Reine-Adelaide.
90'+1',action,"Desolation and heads in hands all over the pitch as Preston see this one slip away from their grasp. What about Giroud though - he's been clutch for Arsenal this season, pulling through with another decisive late goal!"
89',assist,Assist Lucas Pérez Martínez. He was having a bad game up until that incredible piece of tenacity.
89',goal,"Goal Olivier Giroud. GIROUD BREAKS PRESTON HEARTS! The big striker wins the initial flick on which sends Lucas to the byline, and he does excellently to direct the ball back into the path of the Frenchman, who converts to surely end this one!"
87',action,"After a protracted period of pressure, Iwobi hammers a shot right into the arms of Maxwell. Moments later, Pearson goes down with cramp - he's been absolutely everywhere on the pitch!"
85',action,"Makienok's introduction, all six-foot-seven of him, presented Preston with a clear option up front, but so far, they've only managed to fling one cross in his direction which was well dealt with by the defence."
83',action,"Not a lot to report from the pitch, I'm afraid, with Arsenal holding onto the ball in harmless areas. The frustration is growing among both sets of supporters as we trickle away to the end of the game."
83',substitution,Substitution sub-out Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain sub-in Daniel Nii Tackie Mensah Welbeck . Welbeck makes his long-awaited return from injury in place of Oxlade-Chamberlain.
81',substitution,Substitution sub-out Daniel Johnson sub-in Daryl Horgan . Horgan is introduced in place of Johnson.
80',action,"Just over 10 minutes remain in this game and in truth, the Arsenal threat has quelled since the hour mark or so. A draw seems about the fairest result all things considered, but both sides will probably want to avoid a replay."
77',action,"GOAL RULED OUT! Preston fail to clear the ball properly, and Lucas is on the loose ball in a flash, clipping in the clearly offside Giroud for a finish Moments later, the combustible and recently booked Pearson concedes anther foul."
75',substitution,Substitution sub-out Jordan Hugill sub-in Simon Makienok Christoffersen . Hugill is withdrawn and on comes Makienok.
75',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ben Pearson. Pearson finally gets booked for upending Xhaka in the middle of the park. That's yellow number 10 for him this season, meaing a two-match ban. His influence has waned badly in the second half."
72',action,"GREAT PLAY ALL AROUND! Oxlade-Chamberlain plays a flat corner to the near post where Mustafi charges in ahead of Robinson to lash a first-time effort on goal, but Maxwell saves it well!"
70',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Gabriel Armando de Abreu. Gabriel and Hugill, who have been going at it all game, get tangled once again after the Brazilian defender clatters into the forward. Yellow card in what is becoming a feisty game."
67',action,"Xhaka teases in the free-kick, where Giroud gets ahead of Cunningham and plants a header down the throat of Maxwell. The defender is lucky that the referee didn't spot his shirt pull on the French striker."
65',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Greg Cunningham. Cunningham lunges in and upends Lucas, which the referee pulls up, brandishing a yellow card to boot. It appears to be a harsh call against the defender."
64',action,"Maitland-Niles had quite a torrid first half, and he was not helped by the complete lack of communication with Mustafi and Gabriel. He's looked far more assured on and off the ball since."
62',action,"A deep corner is steered back across goal by Perez, where Gabriel tries to flick in Giroud, but Maxwell claims the ball well. Preston are trying to stabilise things a bit after a turbulent second half."
60',substitution,Substitution sub-out Paul Gallagher sub-in Alan Browne . sub-in Alan Browne has been brought on for sub-out Paul Gallagher.
59',action,"Arsenal want a penalty after Giroud's flick on appears to strike Clarke on the arm, but replays show that it only hit him in the chest, vindicating the referee who has made another correct decision."
57',action,"McGeady manages to get his foot around a pass from Johnson and does really well to swing the ball into the area, but Ospina shows strong hands to claim it out of the sky under pressure."
55',action,Arsenal win a corner after Iwobi's cutback is cleared by a frustrated Gallagher. Arsenal continue to find space around the Preston box - it's a complete role reversal from events of the first half.
52',action,"Pearson collides with Ramsey, and the referee pulls him aside for a stern lecture. He'll be suspended for a game if he gets another yellow card. Moments later, Giroud and Gallagher get into a nudging match. It's tense out there."
50',action,"Oxlade-Chamberlain has Gallagher snapping at his heels trying to win the ball back, but he keeps a hold of it and lets fly with another long range effort that's blocked by the impressive Pearson."
48',action,Arsenal storm all over the opposition as both Giroud and Oxlade-Chamberlain have shots blocked. Preston are absorbing an entire half's worth of frustration inside the opening three minutes of the second period.
46',assist,Assist Alex Iwobi. His close control is something else.
46',goal,"Goal Aaron Ramsey. HOW LONG WAS THAT? Iwobi does excellently to hold onto the ball under pressure from a throng of players, and he lays the ball off to Ramsey, who hammers an unstoppable effort into the back of the net!"
46',action,We're back!
,action,"Preston one, Arsenal nil at the break, and it's a scoreline that doesn't tell the full story of just how dominant the home side have been over the Gunners. Mistakes have peppered the visitors' play, and the only question is how the Championship team aren't further ahead than Robinson's early goal"
45'+1',action,Preston keep the ball penned in the Arsenal half as they try to bookend the first half with another goal. Wenger looks like he's ready to unleash on his team at the break and it will be well deserved.
44',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Jordan Hugill. Hugill and Garbriel go up for the ball, and the Brazilian is left on the turf with blood sprouting from his head. The Preston attacker is shown a yellow card."
43',action,"Iwobi feeds the ball quickly into Giroud, who flicks the ball into the path of Lucas, who appears to collide with Cunningham in the box. He's appealing for an elbow and a penalty, but the referee is having none of it."
41',action,Preston have a goal ruled out as Gallagher challenges Ospina for a high ball which spills loose and is converted just as the flag goes up. The keeper was always going to get the benefit of the doubt on that challenge.
39',action,"CHANCES AT EITHER END! Two Mustafi mistakes presents Gallagher with the chance to lop Ospina, but Monreal scoops it off the line. Moments later, Ramsey powers a header right down the throat of Maxwell."
36',action,SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE LEVELLER! Alex Iwobi does well to draw three defenders to him before slipping the run to the open Giroud. His first touch lets him down as the ball is neither a shot nor cross when the keeper should have been tested at the least.
34',action,Arsenal work a lovely passage of play with Giroud and Ramsey exchanging passes at the top of the box. The Welshman turns his first defender in the box but takes too long trying to set up the perfect shot and he's crowded out.
32',action,Still Preston only lead by one goal here as Gabriel loses his balance under no pressure and needs a few touches to clear the ball. Will the home side begin to rue some of these missed chances here?
29',action,"Giroud fails to make proper contact with a ball from the right to a loud jeer from the home fans, who are loving what they're seeing. Welbeck is already warming up on the sidelines - his services may be needed sooner rather than later."
27',action,"This is an embarrassing display from Arsenal as Preston continue to climb all over them. The gaps are appearing all over their back four, and another near miss sees Robinson lurk dangerously at the back post."
24',action,"THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE SECOND! Arsenal are carved apart with a terrible attempt at an offside trap, and Robinson races to the byline and squares the ball across the face of goal. All Hugill has to do is tap the ball home but he can't make contact!"
22',action,"Mustafi makes an important block inside the area after a header from Robinson. Preston are appealing for a handball om the German defender, but replays show that the referee was correct in waving play on."
20',action,Signs that Arsenal are finding the opening to dissect the defence as both Giroud and Lucas are caught narrowly offside in quick succession. Xhaka is looking for that early ball over the top often.
18',action,"Arsenal are starting to exert their traditional dominance of the ball and after a protracted period of possession, they test Christopher Maxwell for the first time with a low drive from Lucas that is swallowed."
16',action,"Arsenal stream forward with Ramsey, who feeds Lucas on the overlap, but his cross is far over the head of Giroud. However, Ainsley Maitland-Niles somehow keeps it alive on the far side to pen Preston back."
14',action,"Arsene Wenger has never lost in the third round of the FA Cup, going 20 for 20 in those fixtures. Preston are doing a great job of putting that record to the test though - they're comfortable here!"
12',action,"Hugill wins a free kick thanks to a rash challenge from Mustafi, and it's a good chance for Preston to swing the ball into the box. However, David Ospina shows safe hands to pluck the ball out of the air."
9',action,"Preston have been the brighter team and they wasted no time in asserting their superiority on the score sheet. Arsenal try to recover with some possession, but both Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lucas are charged down."
7',assist,Assist Jordan Hugill. Hugill had the last touch before Robinson's finish.
7',goal,"Goal Callum Robinson. PRESTON HAVE TAKEN THE LEAD! A lovely throughball finds Hugill splitting the defence with his run, and the home side get the benefit of two fortunate deflections, leaving the ball for Robinson to stroke home."
5',action,Preston are doing well at the beginning of the game as they're not allowing Arsenal to settle on the ball. They're pressing high up the pitch and the Gunners are struggling to pass their way out of trouble.
3',action,Ben Pearson applies pressure on the Arsenal back four and is successful in getting them to turn the ball over in their own defensive third. Callum Robinson tries to shoot on the turn but it's blocked.
1',action,Off we go!
,action,"Marnick Vermijl replaces Bailey Wright in defence, while Aiden McGeady  gets the nod ahead of Eoin Doyle as Simon Grayson opts for a 4-4-2, with Callum Robinson and Jordan Hugill in attack."
,action,"Olivier Giroud leads the line for the visitors, with Danny Welbeck ready on the bench to make his return from an eight-month injury layoff. It's a strong Arsenal side, with Granit Xhaka and Aaron Ramsey in midfield, although Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil aren't in the team."
,action,"Arsenal subs: Holding, Welbeck, Jenkinson, Martinez, Reine-Adelaide, Willock, Dasilva."
,action,"Arsenal (4-2-3-1): Ospina; Maitland-Niles, Mustafi, Gabriel, Monreal; Ramsey, Xhaka; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Iwobi, Lucas; Giroud."
,action,"Preston subs: Lindegaard, Browne, Makienok, Doyle, Spurr, Pringle, Horgan."
,action,"Preston (4-4-2): Maxwell; Vermijl, Clarke, Huntington, Cunningham; Gallagher, Pearson, Johnson, McGeady; Robinson, Hugill."
,action,"Arsenal began to stutter in the league in December, dropping eight points - which coincidentally is the deficit they now face against leaders Chelsea. However, having won this competition twice in the last four years and with only one loss in 36 cup ties against lower-league opponents, they will fancy their chances."
,action,"Preston have lost just one of their last six games to move into the top half of the EFL Championship, where they sit in 11th place. However, with only one win in their last 15 against opposition from the top flight, they are very much the underdogs even at home."
,action,"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the FA Cup third-round tie between Preston North End and Arsenal. Both sides are the only two to have gone through an entire top-flight season unbeaten in England, but eyes today are on a place in the fourth round."
