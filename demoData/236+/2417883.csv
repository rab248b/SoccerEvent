,action,"Thanks for joining our commentary this afternoon. Until next time, goodbye."
,action,"One concern for Mauricio Pochettino will be the injury picked up by Harry Kane in the first half, but if his trio of Eriksen, Alli and Son maintain the level of form displayed this afternoon - the club could be on course for silverware."
,action,"Tottenham advance to the semi-finals of the FA Cup for the first time since 2012 with a emphatic win over Millwall this afternoon. Son Heung-Min will take the headlines, scoring a fine hat-trick, while Dele Alli, Christian Eriksen and Vincent Janssen also got on the scoresheet."

90'+2',goal,"Goal Heung-Min Son. GOALLLL!! SON HAS A HAT-TRICK! Spurs notch their sixth goal as Son latches on to Eriksen's cross to the back post and meets the ball first time on the volley. His effort is straight at King, but the keeper allows the ball to squirm through his legs and into the net."
90',action,There will be two minutes of added time.
90',action,"OVER! Winks goes for goal once more and this time he strikes his effort a lot better than his previous attempt, but the ball just does not tip enough under the bar to find the net."
89',action,"BLOCK! Son is desperate for his hat-trick, but is denied again with Williams making a block with his head to stop his left-footed strike."
87',action,"Son skips forward in a run through the middle, and only a fine tackle from Cooper stop him unleashing an effort at goal."
85',action,"Everyone's trying to get in on the act now for Spurs - with Winks blasting a strike from distance. He's only threatening the fans behind the goal with his effort, blasting it well over the bar."
83',action,"CHANCE! Janssen should have his second from open play as he latches on to Davies' pinpoint cross from the left. However, with the goal gaping, he can only head his effort straight at King."
81',action,The frustration for Millwall is palpable with Gregory booting the ball in an attempt at goal. It was nowhere near the net and would not have counted anyway as the referee had blown for a foul on Alderweireld.
79',assist,Assist Heung-Min Son. Son maintains his level of excellent and unselfishly helps out his team-mate with a low pass rather than going for his hat-trick.
79',goal,"Goal Vincent Janssen. GOALLLL!!!! THE WAIT IS OVER! JANSSEN SCORES FROM OPEN PLAY! The Dutchman gets his first goal from open play since his move to the club with a neat finish into the bottom corner, converting Son's low cross into the box. Relief for the Netherlands forward."

72',goal,"Goal Bamidele Alli. GOALLLL!!! SPURS HAVE FOUR! Alli's perseverance pays off as he converts Eriksen's cross at the back post. It's another fine move from the home side, moving the ball quickly across from the right before the England man gets the goal he wanted this afternoon."
71',action,"Williams wastes a decent chance for the visitors to threaten from a set-piece. He fails to hit his cross with enough pace and Spurs are able to clear their lines, winning a set-piece of their own with Vertonghen being fouled by Cooper."
70',substitution,Substitution sub-out Jed Wallace sub-in Shane Ferguson . Wallace makes way for Ferguson.
67',action,"Spurs have been excellent in possession this afternoon and are slowly taking the life out of the visitors, who have not had an answer for them."

63',action,"CHANCE! Son has an opening to notch his hat-trick, but spurns the chance from a tight angle firing over the ball. Davies had done well down the left to create the opportunity for his team-mate."

59',action,"CHANCE! Millwall spurn an opening to get a goal back with Wallace firing over from close range. The substituteÂ Onyedinma made the opportunity with a mazy run on the right before teeing up his team-mate, but Wallace failed to convert."
58',substitution,Substitution sub-out Steve Morison sub-in Fred Onyedinma . Onyedinma replaces Morison for the visitors.
58',action,"WIDE! Alli has had a frustrating afternoon and his annoyance rises as he fails to connect with a strike from the edge of the box, sending his effort wide."
57',yellow-card,Yellow Card Tony Craig. Yellow card Tony Craig
56',action,"PENALTY SHOUT! Spurs play their way through the visitors defence again. Davies shoots from a tight angle, forcing a fine save from King. Alli goes for the rebound, but gets held, only for referee Atkinson to wave away his appeal."
54',assist,"Assist Kieran Trippier. Trippier sends a delightful ball over the top for Son, which is rewarded with a goal from the South Korean."
54',goal,"Goal Heung-Min Son. GOALLLLL!!! SON HAS HIS SECOND! Tottenham all but secure their place in the last four as they score another fine goal. Trippier sends the ball over the top of the Millwall defence and Son makes a clever run. His finish is even better as he meets it first time on the volley, dispatching his effort into the bottom corner. Sublime all around from the home side."
51',action,"OVER! Millwall enjoy a rare foray forward with Gregory causing a nuisance in the box. Morison gathers the loose ball to tee up Williams on the edge of the box, but he fires well over the bar and into the stand behind the goal."

46',substitution,Substitution sub-out Ben Thompson sub-in Calum Butcher . Butcher replaces Thompson for the visitors.
46',action,We're back underway at White Hart Lane.
,action,"The players are making their way back out on to the field, so we should be underway again shortly."
,action,Millwall have barely been in the game thus far and have been put constantly on the back foot due to Spurs' dominance in the middle of the park. Neil Harris could be pondering changes at the break.
,action,Tottenham managed to overcome the early loss of Harry Kane to injury to hold a comfortable 2-0 lead at the break. Christian Eriksen replaced Kane from the bench and opened the scoring with a fine volleyed finish from inside the box before Son Heung-Min doubled their advantage with a stunning strike.

35',action,"OFF THE BAR! Spurs come within inches of doubling their lead with Wanyama striking the bar from a corner. Eriksen's delivery was pinpoint and the midfielder rose well to head at goal, only to be denied by the woodwork."
32',action,"WIDE! Millwall win a free-kick down the left as O'Brien is fouled by Dier. Williams sends the ball into the middle and it's O'Brien, who rises highest to head at goal, but it drifts wide of the target."
31',assist,Assist Bamidele Alli. Alli's chest down falls perfectly for his team-mate in the box to volley home.
31',goal,"Goal Christian Dannemann Eriksen. GOALLLLL!!! SPURS TAKE THE LEAD! Eriksen puts the home side ahead with a fine strike on the half-volley, dispatching his effort past King from inside the box.

24',action,Trippier has not had a good start to the game and his poor afternoon continues as he touches Vertonghen's diagonal ball straight out for a goal-kick.
23',action,"PENALTY SHOUT! Alli goes down in the box with Craig pulling his shirt, but the referee dismisses Spurs' appeals for a penalty."
21',action,"From the resulting corner from Wallace, Vorm is able to make an important claim at the back post under pressure from Morison."
20',action,"Wanyama brings down Thompson on the left and the visitors are able to throw men forward in attack. However, Webster's header at the back post is cleared behind by Vertonghen."
18',action,"Spurs are failing to click in the final third at the moment. They've had the majority of possession, but have restricted to efforts from distance and from wide areas at goal."
17',action,Davies makes an interesting pass back to Vorm on the halfway line. The Welshman gets the attempt all wrong and dispatches the kick out for a throw-in.
15',action,"CHANCE! Trippier sends a dangerous diagonal cross towards Alli on the left flank. King comes out to claim, but stops in his tracks. The midfielder attempts to head the ball past him, but he fails to make solid contact, allowing the visitors to clear."

8',action,Kane is going straight down the tunnel as his involvement this afternoon appears to be over.
7',action,"SAVE! Son raids into the right inside channel this time and takes on the shot - like Kane. However, King makes another smart stop at his near post."
6',action,"CHANCE! Winks has another effort at goal from the right side of the box, but once again King is able to get down to make the stop before gathering at the second attempt."
6',action,"Nightmare for Spurs fans as Kane stays down after his shot. He appears to have hurt his ankle after falling awkwardly, and requires treatment behind the goal."
