,action,"That's all for our live coverage, thanks for following along. Goodbye!"
,action,"Saul opened the scoring with a controversial goal that likely should have been called back for offside, while Antoine Griezmann added a second, his first in 843 minutes in LaLiga, as Diego Simeone's side open 2017 with three points."
90'+2',action,FULL-TIME: EIBAR 0-2 ATLETICO.
90'+1',action,"Meanwhile, the assistant referee indicates there will be just two minutes of added time."
89',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Tiago Manuel Dias Correia. Bebe is booked for dissent, tugging back on the shirt of the referee as he believes Nano was fouled in the area. Frustration clearly starting to set in here."
89',action,"Eibar come close to pulling one back through Nano, who nearly got on the end of a diagonal ball in from the left, but the offside flag was up so it wouldn't have counted anyhow."
87',action,"NEARLY A THIRD! Gameiro chases a clever ball over the top from Koke and manages to nudge it beyond Yoel. The touch takes him to a bit of a difficult angle, and he crashes his effort into the side netting as a result!"
85',action,"Into the last five minutes now and, while there is still time for a late push, the body language of these Eibar players suggest this is nothing more than a formality. They're urgency has dropped off significantly and Atletico are looking more than comfortable as they aim to run the final minutes off the clock."
83',action,"STAT: Antoine Griezmann scored his first LaLiga goal in 843 minutes, snapping his worst-ever goalless drought for Atletico."
82',substitution,Substitution sub-out Adrián González Morales sub-in Alexander Mesa Travieso . Eibar make their final change as Nano replaces Adrian.
81',yellow-card,Yellow Card Jorge Resurrección Merodio. Koke slides into Dani Garcia with his studs showing and that's going to bring a yellow card for the Atletico midfielder.
80',action,The intensity of the match has faded a bit as we enter the final 10 minutes. A combination of the scoreline and this cold weather has seen both sides take their foot off the gas just a bit. Atletico certainly appear on course for the three points now.
78',action,"This is really, really harsh on Eibar, it must be said. Atletico took the lead against the run of play through an offside goal, and then after Eibar came close on a few occasions to an equaliser, they go 2-0 down following an Atletcio counter. It really is a tough pill for them to swallow - they will feel they deserved better, and it's hard to argue against that."
76',substitution,Substitution sub-out Pedro León Sánchez Gil sub-in Rubén Peña Jiménez . A second change for Eibar sees Ruben Pena come on for Pedro Leon.
74',assist,Assist Kevin Gameiro. Gameiro's first contribution off the bench sees him assist the goal which likely puts this game to bed.
74',goal,Goal Antoine Griezmann. AND THAT'S TWO! Griezmann snaps a lengthy spell without a LaLiga goal as he arrives in the six-yard box to turn in Gameiro's short cross following a swift and decisive break! Simeone's substitution pays dividends in a matter of minutes!
71',substitution,Substitution sub-out Fernando José Torres Sanz sub-in Kevin Gameiro . Atletico's second change sees sub-in Kevin Gameiro replace Fernando Torres.
70',action,"HOW HAS THAT STAYED OUT?! Bebe's first involvement sees him deliver a corner beautifully into the six-yard box, dropping in at the far post, but somehow it's not turned in by Fran Rico! Pressure stays on and Pedro Leon is gifted a shooting chance from 15 yards, but he drills an effort wide of the far post!"
68',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Takashi Inui sub-in Tiago Manuel Dias Correia . Eibar make their first change of the afternoon, following a good bit of attacking play that had Atletico scrambling for a moment. It's Inui who gives way, to be replaced by Bebe."
66',action,STAT: Atletico and Barcelona are the only sides who Eibar have faced more than once without a win or a draw.
64',action,"Atletico's midfield players deserve high praise for their work rate. They're closing their gaps exceptionally with Eibar in possession, giving the ball carriers shockingly little time to pick out a pass. Eibar need a bit more movement off the ball to open up space."
62',action,"Eibar have enjoyed the bulk of possession since falling behind, but Atletico have plenty of bodies back in defence. They're looking entirely comfortable as they keep the hosts to the periphery, not allowing them a way through into the area."
60',action,"Replays show that indeed Saul was a good half a yard offside, at least, when Filipe Luis delivered his cross. That's a big miss from the linesman, but Eibar don't seem to bothered by it, probably because they don't realize it yet. When they see the replay after the match, there will be some angry faces in that locker room."
58',action,"From a neutral perspective, the game needed a goal, and got it. That should help open things up a bit, with Eibar forced to take a few more chances going forward, provided Atletico don't decide to try and set up shop in defence to milk this lead through to full-time - though that seems entirely unlikely."
56',action,"STAT: Eibar have lost their four games against Atletico in La Liga, conceding an average of 2.5 goals per game."
54',assist,"Assist Filipe Luis Kasmirski. Nice pick out there from Filipe Luis, who provided the quality cross this game has been desperately crying out for."
54',goal,"Goal Saúl Ñíguez Esclapez. ATLETICO BREAK THE DEADLOCK! A corner is played short for Filipe Luis, who bends in a first-time ball towards the near post. Saul, who actually looked to be just offside when it was played in, meets the delivery and sends a superb glancing header in at the far post!"
52',action,"Delicious interplay! That's the best passage of attack play we've been treated to in this match, and it comes via the hosts. Some stellar one-touch passing in and around the area, including a delightful back-heel, send Luna into space in the area, but he tries to drill in a cross instead of having a shot, and Godin is on hand to turn it away!"
50',action,"Eibar spend a decent spell in attack, and for once don't seem to be lacking support in the final third. They work it around smartly on the flank, but it all comes to an end as Luna hammers a cross in with far too much pace, sending it sailing behind for a goal kick."
48',action,"Both sides remain very committed to defending. The teams exchange early, hopeful attacks, but there's just too many bodies back behind the ball for space to be found. The game is there for the taking, but someone has to be willing to take a chance here."
46',action,Back underway in Eibar!
46',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Šime Vrsaljko sub-in Juan Francisco Torres Belén . Juanfran replaces Vrsaljko, who was on a booking, at the half."
,action,"Chances few and far between in the first half as the teams head scoreless into the break following an intense but altogether untidy opening 45 minutes at the Ipurua Municipal Stadium. Eibar posed the greater attacking threat, but that's not exactly saying much as keeper Yoel has yet to have a save to make."
45',action,HALF-TIME: EIBAR 0-0 ATLETICO.
43',action,"OH MY WHAT A CHANCE! That's the sort of opportunities you can't afford to squander in a game with so few chances! Savic tries to break up a pass and winds up knocking it kindly into the path of Sergi Enrich, who makes an absolute mess of it! He can't sort out his footing with a clean sight of goal, actually fumbling the ball behind for a goal kick!"
41',action,"Dani Garcia tries his luck with a volley from range after a decent bit of build-up play from the hosts, but he gets the contact all wrong in the end, completely skying his effort. He's visibly upset with himself following that mishit."
39',action,"More pinball in midfield as we approach the final five minutes of the first half. Barring a sudden upswing in urgency, which there has been little of, it looks as though we will head into the interval scoreless - a fair indication of how this first half has unfolded."
37',action,"What this match desperately needs is a goal. It's been largely tedious and disjointed throughout this first half, with rare glimpses of attacking intent scattered throughout otherwise long spells of harmless possession."
35',action,"STAT: Antoine Griezmann has gone 769 minutes without a goal, his worst run in La Liga for Atletico."
33',action,"Disappointing! It's Atletico's turn to threaten from a free-kick, in an enticing position. Griezmann lines up a strike from just over 25 yards, but he too sends an effort crashing straight into the wall before Eibar clear the threat. That simply has to be better."
31',action,"PENALTY APPEALS DENIED! Leon's free-kick smacks off the face of Torres and behind. The ensuing corner creates a bit of a scramble in the penalty area, and it winds up striking the planted arm of Vrsaljko, but the right-back knew little about it as he was simply trying to hoist himself back up off the ground."
29',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Šime Vrsaljko. Vrsaljko can't deal with the pace and trickery of Inui on the break, conceding a free-kick and picking up Atletico's first yellow of the night in the process. This one is in a dangerous position for Pedro Leon to line up a shot at goal."
28',action,"Atletico win a throw deep in the Eibar half, which Griezmann takes. It's flicked on at the near post for Godin, who flicks on again towards the far post, but there's absolutely no one there to get on the end of it as the hosts clear their lines with ease."
26',action,"Griezmann has hardly been involved much this afternoon, and you have to wonder what the future holds for him. He's been heavily linked with Manchester United in the past couple of days, and with Atletico struggling as much as they are, Diego Simeone can ill-afford to lose him."
24',action,"MUCH BETTER! Atletico are very much second best here as Eibar up the intensity. Capa makes a nice little run down the left, skipping past his marker cleverly, before lifting in a cross for Adrian, who slides in to direct an effort at goal, but it makes for a rater comfortable save in the end for Moya."
22',action,"STAT: Eibar have not lost in their last four La Liga games at home (W3 D1), while they have never gone five in a row in a single season in La Liga."
20',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Adrián González Morales. Adrian has little chance at winning the ball when he sticks a leg out and cynically trips Gimenez, which doesn't go unpunished by the referee, who produces the first yellow card of the match for the Eibar midfielder."
18',action,"Eibar win themselves a corner, and straight away they get the big bodies forward from the back. Anticipation builds, but Pedro Leon completely scuffs his delivery, which bounces feebly into the area before being cleared easily at the near post."
16',action,"Sergi Enrich has lacked service through the first quarter of an hour, but he doesn't know the meaning of a lost cause. The striker is chasing down everything sent towards his general vicinity, and is proving a nuisance for the Atletico defence as a result."
14',action,"Goals have been in short supply for Atletico of late and you can see why. There's just no real organization from them up top, with plenty of hopeful, stray passes plaguing their attempts to break into the final third. Yoel has yet to be called into action in the Eibar goal."
12',action,"There's not real flow to this match through 12 minutes at the Ipurua Municipal Stadium. Eibar continue to have more success stringing passes together, but it's all rather innocuous from them, while Atletico have barely been able to get into the final third - though when they do, they do look just a bit sharper."
10',action,"Eibar took the time over the winter break to lay a fresh pitch, but some unexpectedly cold weather has left a thin layer of frost covering parts of it, especially the near side which has been shaded from the sun. It almost looks frozen, but the ball doesn't seem to be bouncing any differently out there - still, something worth keeping an eye on."
8',action,STAT: Atletico have lost three of their last four La Liga away games (W1) without scoring.
6',action,"Atletico have appeared rather disjointed in possession in these early stages, while Eibar have actually come across quite confident. The hosts are enjoying more time on the ball, and look threatening when they do get forward, though the bulk of their possession is coming in the wide areas."
4',action,"A bit of loose passing from Eibar high up the pitch sees Atletico pounce and break through Griezmann. The Frenchman has speed to burn out on the right and has Lejune retreating, but the Eibar centre-half does brilliantly to block his passage through on goal without needing to commit a foul."
2',action,"Terrific start from the hosts! Luna makes strides down the left and whips in an inviting ball, which causes a bit of panic at the back. Sergi Enrich attacks it in the air, but Moya does well to rise and pluck it off the line!"
1',action,"AND THEY'RE OFF! Eibar in their burgundy and blue strip get us underway, attacking right to left, with Atletico in red and white."
,action,"Diego Simeone has made three changes from their 1-0 win over Las Palmas to close out 2016. Filipe Luis is restored at left-back, while Jose Gimenez comes in to play in a holding midfield role, at the expense of Lucas Hernandez and Yannick Carrasco. Fernando Torres will lead the line up top, with Kevin Gameiro dropping to the bench."
,action,"Jose Luis Mendilibar has made four changes to his side from their final league match of 2016, a 1-1 draw at Leganes. Ander Capa and Mauro Dos Santos come into defence, replacing Anaitz Arbilla and Alejandro Galvez, while Fran Rico and Adrian are selected ahead of Gonzalo Escalante and striker Ruben Pena, leaving Sergi Enrich alone to lead the line."
,action,"SUBS: Correa, Hernandez, Juanfran, Gameiro, Gaitan, Moreira, Juan Moreno."
,action,"ATLETICO (4-5-1): Moya; Vrsaljko, Savic, Godin, Filipe Luis; Griezmann, Gabi, Gimenez, Koke, Saul; Torres."
,action,"SUBS: Galvez, Escalante, Ruben Pena, Asier Riesgo, Nano, Junca, Bebe."
,action,"EIBAR (4-2-3-1): Yoel; Capa, Dos Santos, Lejune, Luna; Dani Garcia, Fran Rico; Pedro Leon, Adrian, Inui; Sergi Enrich."
