,action,"That's all from us today folks, we hope you enjoyed the game!"
,action,"Hull have secured a huge three points here today in their battle to remain in the Premier League. West Ham took the lead through Andy Carroll in the first-half, however Hull came out at half-time with a fresh game plan and quickly equalised through Andy Robertson, before Andrea Ranocchia scored late on to clinch a 2-1 victory."
,action,FULL-TIME: HULL 2-1 WEST HAM
90'+7',action,That's the full-time whistle!
90'+5',action,"Just over a minute to play here now, Hull are trying to waste time near the corner flag. The home supporters are pleading with the referee to blow the whistle now."
90'+3',action,"Carroll works some space on the edge of the box, however he is quickly put under pressure from a number of Hull players and his effort goes well wide of the goal. Jakupovic is in no hurry to take the goal-kick."
90'+2',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Cheikhou Kouyaté sub-in Jonathan Calleri . West Ham make their final substitution, with Kouyaté the man heading off and he is replaced by sub-in Jonathan Calleri."
90',action,There will be a minimum of six minutes of added time played here!
88',action,"The Hammers are pushing forward in numbers now, looking to grab an equalising goal. Another long ball comes into the box and Jakupovic rises high to punch the ball clear, he gets a knock for his troubles but looks fine to continue."
85',assist,Assist Kamil Grosicki. The Poland international whipped a great ball into the box from the set piece and Ranocchia made no mistake with the header.
85',goal,"Goal Andrea Ranocchia. GOOOAAALLL! HULL TAKE THE LEAD! Ranocchia has scored a huge goal for the Tigers! The Italian beat his marker at a corner, meeting it at the near post and guided his header into the far corner, giving Randolph no chance. The KCOM is electric. What an important goal that could be."
85',action,"It's all Hull at the moment! The Tigers are pushing hard for the winning goal here and the Hammers are struggling to cope, with the fresh legs of Henriksen and Maloney."
84',action,Great opportunity for Hull to put the ball into the box. Grosicki and Robertson stand over the free-kick on the left flank and the Hammers have brought everyone back. However the ball in by Grosicki is a poor one and West Ham clear the danger.
82',action,"CHANCE HULL! Excellent play by the Tigers in the final third. It was great link up play between Markovic and Henriksen, with the latter firing a volley at goal but it goes well wide of the goal."
80',substitution,Substitution sub-out Abel Mathías Hernández Platero sub-in Markus Henriksen . The third and final Hull substitution sees Abel Hernández  be replaced by sub-in Markus Henriksen. Hernandez only returned to the Tigers yesterday after playing for Uruguay during the international break.
79',substitution,Substitution sub-out Alfred John Momar N'Diaye sub-in Shaun Maloney . The first of a double substitution by the Tigers and it is an attacking change. N'Diaye is the man heading off the pitch and he is replaced by sub-in Shaun Maloney.
77',action,"That potential change by the Tigers has been put on hold for the moment as Maguire looks to have picked up a slight knock. Silva will be eager for the defender to run off this injury, as Maguire has been solid at the back today."
75',action,"There is more activity on the Hull City bench, Marco Silva is preparing more changes to his side in search of a crucial second goal."
73',yellow-card,Yellow Card Alfred John Momar N'Diaye. Mike Jones has ran out of patience and has shown a yellow card to N'Diaye after a number of fouls by the Tigers midfielder.
71',action,"The visitors are playing better now, they have recovered from their shaky spell when Hull had them on the ropes. There is still 20 minutes to play here at the KCOM Stadium, could either side grab a winning goal? Plenty of time to do so."
69',action,STAT: West Ham have now only kept one clean sheet in their last 13 Premier League games. The Tigers are playing well and you can see the confidence flowing through their players as they try and push forward and score another goal.
68',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Aaron Cresswell sub-in Arthur Masuaku . Another Hammers substitution, this time due to an injury suffered by sub-out Aaron Cresswell, he is replaced by sub-in Arthur Masuaku."
66',substitution,Substitution sub-out Robert Snodgrass sub-in Edimilson Fernandes . West Ham make the first substitution of the game. The former Hull winger sub-out Robert Snodgrass is the man coming off and he is replaced by sub-in Edimilson Fernandes.
65',action,"Grosicki is the man to take the set piece, however his effort is low and doesn't have enough power behind it. Randolph gets down well and gathers the ball. Much needed rest for the Hammers as they have had to withstand heavy pressure from the hosts since the break."
64',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Andy Carroll. Carroll tracked back well to help his teammates out in defence, but he is deemed to have handled the ball whilst making a challenge. Free-kick to Hull in a shooting position."
62',action,"PENALTY SHOUT! Hull want a penalty after Maguire is brought down in the box following a corner. The centre-back is adamant he was unfairly brought down by Fonte, but the referee disagrees and play continues."
60',action,"OFF THE POST! West Ham are under huge amounts of pressure now! N'Diaye smashes the ball against the post, the rebound then falls to Grosicki who tries to curl the ball into the top corner, but it goes agonisingly wide! So much better from the hosts!"
59',action,"HUGE CHANCE! Markovic did brilliantly to beat several West Ham defenders, he should have passed to Grosicki, Niasse or Hernandez who made good runs, however the winger tries to go himself and is ushered out of play by Fonte. Great run by Markovic but he needed to produce the final ball."
58',yellow-card,"Yellow Card El-Hadji Baye Oumar Niasse. Niasse is the first Hull player to go into book, for a rash tackle on Feghouli."
55',action,"CHANCE! West Ham go close to scoring not long after Hull go level! Carroll rose above Ranocchia to get his head on the ball, after Cresswell whipped another ball into the box. However his header is low and straight at Jakupovic who gathers the ball on the second attempt. Good chance."
53',assist,"Assist Kamil Grosicki. The half-time substitute, Grosicki has made an impact already. A great ball into the path of Robertson, who showed terrific composure to fire the ball into the back of the net."
53',goal,"Goal Andrew Robertson. GOOOAAALLL HULL! Andy Robertson has equalised for the Tigers! A huge goal for Hull City today and in their quest to avoid relegation! Markovic won the ball in the middle of the pitch, he played a quick ball to Grosicki who played a delicate ball into the path of Robertson who used his pace to beat Collins on the edge of the box, before putting the ball past Randolph into the bottom corner of the net."
52',action,"One key issue for Hull so far today has been a lack of composure and quality with their final ball. Elmohamady does well to get into space down the right, he whips a ball into the box but Fonte clears the ball with ease, after Hernandez fails to anticipate the cross."
49',action,Ranocchia is down on the edge of his own box after a collision with Snodgrass. The home supporters want a foul and more punishment for Snodgrass but the referee disagrees. Once again it looks like the Tigers defender will be fine to continue.
48',action,"Good start to the second period by Hull. They have kept possession well and are looking to attack straight away, with Grosicki adding a further boost going forward for the hosts."
46',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Curtis Davies sub-in Kamil Grosicki . Half-time substitution for the Tigers, as skipper sub-out Curtis Davies is replaced by sub-in Kamil Grosicki. Looks like Hull will be switching to a 4-4-2 formation now, they need to change something if they are to come out of this game with any points."
46',action,The second half is underway!
,action,"Andy Carroll's strike separates the two sides at the break here. The Hammers skipper has been a nuisance so far, causing Ranocchia and Davies plenty of problems. Hull have played well, but have struggled to create anything going forward."
,action,HALF-TIME: HULL 0-1 WEST HAM
45'+3',action,That's the half-time whistle!
45',action,There will be a minimum of three minutes added time played here.
44',action,"Mistake from Maguire on the edge of his own box, he tried to play a pass to Clucas but his ball was sloppy and easily picked up by Snodgrass. This allows the Hammers to break into the final third, the ball comes into the box looking once again for Carroll but Jakupovic reads the cross well and picks the ball out of the air."
42',action,"The England manager Gareth Southgate is in the stands here today, casting an eye over the English talent on show, with Carroll and Harry Maguire the two players that spring to mind."
40',action,Not long to go until the half-time whistle now. Can Hull grab an equaliser before the break?
38',action,"Markovic sprints past several Hammers defenders, trying to set up a counter-attack, he sprays the ball out wide to N'Diaye, he passes to Hernandez, who is then brought down by Cresswell. Free-kick to Hull. Sam Clucas takes, but Randolph punches the ball clear."
37',action,"West Ham have a free-kick in a decent position, with Snodgrass the man to whip the ball into the box. However the ball in is easily gathered in the air by Jakupovic who immediately tries to set up a Hull counter-attack."
34',action,"Despite having more possession the last 10 minutes, the Tigers have not troubled the visitors defence and they have looked comfortable at the back. Markovic has been sloppy when he has been on the ball, and the two Hull strikers have barely touched the ball in the penalty area."
32',action,"CHANCE LANZINI! The Hammers winger cut inside and had plenty of time and space to line up a shot at goal. His low effort goes narrowly wide of the far post, with Jakupovic having to get down and make a good save to make sure. West Ham corner comes to nothing."
30',action,"STAT: Hull are unbeaten in their last seven home games in all competitions, this has given them a fighting chance of survival. However they need to up their game going forward, if that run is to continue."
28',action,"Still no goalscoring chances for the Tigers, however they are putting West Ham under more and more pressure. This is helping to increase the atmosphere here at the KCOM, with the fans really appreciating the effort form their side."
25',action,"Despite going a goal down, Hull still look confident and are playing the ball around well. Markovic and Hernandez did well to put Darren Randolph under pressure as he attempted the clear the ball in his box. The Hammers keeper tried to dribble the ball from danger, rather than launch the ball upfield. Hull almost took advantage!"
22',action,"Andrea Ranocchia is limping off here, but it looks as though he'll be able to carry on. Michael Dawson is warming up on the sideline, he is the obvious replacement but has only just returned from injury himself."
21',action,"Andy Carroll now has 50 Premier League goals, the Hammers skipper has been causing Davies plenty of problems here today, and is always available for the long ball if his teammates are in trouble at the other end of the pitch."
18',assist,"Assist Aaron Cresswell. Cresswell launched a long ball up to Carroll, who brought the ball down with ease and slotted the ball into the back of the net, to give the Hammers an early lead."
18',goal,"Goal Andy Carroll. GOOOAAALLL WEST HAM! Carroll gives the visitors the lead! The stand-in skipper does brilliantly to read the cross into the box, Curtis Davies completely mistimes his attempted clearance and Carroll takes advantage. The striker chests the ball down and the fires past Jakupovic who stood no chance, he had acres of time to pick his spot."
14',action,"CHANCE WEST HAM! Snodgrass almost gives the visitors the lead! The winger managed to get away from Ahmed Elmohamady at the back post and get his head to the ball from a Sofiane Feghouli cross, but his header is straight at Eldin Jakupovic who makes a comfortable save."
12',action,"Hull have the first corner of the game. Can they take advantage? Lazar Markovic is the man to take... Carroll rises highest and briefly gets the ball clear but the Tigers are on the attack once again. Oumar Niasse whips a ball into the box from the right and Aaron Cresswell almost puts the ball into his own net! Another Hull corner, this time the Hammers clear the danger at the first time of asking."
10',action,"Both sets of fans are making themselves heard here at the KCOM, with the visiting fans travelling up from London in large numbers to support their side. Meanwhile the home fans will know the importance of getting a win here, with an even bigger game coming up on Wednesday."
8',action,"The Hammers are starting to grow into the game, enjoying possession in the middle of the pitch but are not threatening the Hull back three. Manuel Lanzini and Robert Snodgrass need to try and get on the ball more, run at the defence and whip balls into the box for Andy Carroll who can be lethal in the air."
6',action,Scrappy start from both sides here at the KCOM. Neither side are able to keep the ball and string a few passes together in the midfield at the moment. An early goal for either side could be pivotal.
4',action,"Hull have never lost at home to West Ham in the Premier League. Furthermore, the away team has never won this fixture in the Premier League, with seven home victories and two draws. Both draws came at Hull: 3-3 in November 2009 and 2-2 in September 2014."
2',yellow-card,"Yellow Card José Miguel da Rocha Fonte. The referee Mike Jones has no choice but no show a yellow card to José Fonte, for a late and rash tackle on Abel Hernandez. It was a poor tackle from the former Saints defender, as Hernandez was going nowhere on the half-way line."
2',action,"This is a huge game for both teams today. Hull need three points to boost their survival chances, meanwhile the Hammers are in a poor run of form themselves and find themselves in the bottom half of the table."
1',action,We're underway!

,action,"Hull City will be looking to extend their unbeaten home record under Marco Silva. The Tigers have never suffered relegation directly after gaining promotion to the Premier League. If they're to avoid that outcome in May it's clear their escape route centres on continued home success, starting with today’s game against West Ham at the KCOM."
