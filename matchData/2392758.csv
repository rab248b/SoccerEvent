77',action,Tottenham have been dealt a handicap as Trippier decides his injury is too much of an issue to continue the match and he heads down to the tunnel. Possibly a lifeline for Wycombe.
75',action,It's starting to get scrappy on the edge of the Wycombe box as Tottenham attempt to force their way through and the League 2 side fail to clear the ball.
73',action,Looks as if Spurs are looking to knock the ball around the pitch to kill some time and allow Trippier back on the pitch. Despite a small limp it appears as if the full-back will continue playing.

52',action,"Cries for a penalty from the Tottenham supporters as Janssen tries to push off Pierre but goes to ground, but the referee is having none of it and quickly waves away the claims."
50',action,"CHANCE! Sissoko does well on the right side to twist past Gape and pull a pass back to Son, but the striker leans back too much as he shoots and fires his effort into the stands."
48',action,"Early danger for Wycombe to deal with as a deep cross is hooked back into the box by Davies, but the full-back in unable to find another white shirt with his pass and Jombati smashes the play away."

42',yellow-card,Yellow Card Sido Jombarti. Jombati gets the first yellow card of the afternoon.

33',action,Wycombe are struggling to make it out of their half since the goal as Tottenham look to find an equaliser before the half time whistle with the home side's corner count flying up.
31',action,"SAVE! Blackman with a fantastic save this time. Sissoko's neat footwork allows him to poke a neat pass through to Son, but the South Korean's drilled effort is pushed away from danger by the goalkeeper."

17',action,"A fantastic ball forward from Carter-Vickers is headed down by Dier into the box, allowing Son to gamble and attempt to prod the ball past the goalkeeper, but Blackman was aware of the danger and pounced on the play."
15',action,"Hayes commits a cheap foul in defence to gift a free-kick to Tottenham, but the home side opt to play the ball short and Wood rushes out of the wall to win back possession. A wasted opportunity by the Premier League side."
