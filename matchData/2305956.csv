,action,"FULL-TIME! Juventus close out a comfortable 2-0 victory against Lazio, with early goals from Dybala and Higuain wrapping up the three points for the Old Lady. The away side lose ground in the hunt for Champions League football, while Juventus remain four points clear at the top of Serie A. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+2',action,"Pjaca drops a shoulder and gets into the penalty area, before being bundled over, but the referee doesn't point to the spot. The Juventus substitute looked to have a case for a penalty, after a clumsy push from a defender."
90'+1',action,We're into three minutes of stoppage time at the end of the second half.
89',action,"Pjaca works the ball out to Cuadrado on the right-hand side, with the Colombian returning the ball straight to the substitute on the edge of the area. The Croatian tries to shoot first-time, rather than taking a touch, and as a result lifts an awful attempt high over the crossbar."
87',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Gonzalo Gerardo Higuaín sub-in Marko Pjaca . Higuain is replaced for the last few minutes and is given a standing ovation by the home fans, with Pjaca coming into the game. That should push Mandzukic into a more central area."
85',action,"Asamoah feeds a pass into the penalty area, picking out Mandzukic, but De Vrij stands firm. Moments later, Higuain is forced to play the ball wide rather than shoot, with an eventual cross not forthcoming. Lazio try to break, but Barzagli covers across brilliantly to make a tackle."
83',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Marco Parolo. Parolo picks up a yellow card for a tackle made out of frustration, as the Italian midfielder dives into a really poor challenge."
82',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Paulo Bruno Dybala sub-in Tomás Eduardo Rincón Hernández . Dybala is replaced, after putting in a good performance, with Rincon coming into the game to congest the midfield third and see this result out."
81',action,"Dybala is mobbed by Lazio players as he looks to pull the trigger from 20 yards out, with Juventus still looking the more likely of the two sides to grab the third goal of the afternoon. Parolo and Immobile combine, before a low pass is fed into the Juve box, but the hosts hoof clear."
79',action,"Juventus maintain possession well, before Pjanic dances forward. The ex-Roma midfielder flicks a pass into Higuain, who shimmies onto his right foot, but the Juventus goalscorer is closed down before he can shoot."
77',action,"Mandzukic is picked out on the left-hand side and tries to cut back inside, but Murgia makes a smart tackle to frustrate the Croatian striker. Juventus are generally content to drop back in numbers, before rocketing forward on the break at any given opportunity."
76',action,"Anderson cuts infield from the right, before finding Milinkovic-Savic. The Serbian midfielder tries to clip a pass over the top to find Parolo, but Bonucci does brilliantly to stick out a leg and make a vital interception. That was the first time that Lazio have truly stretched the hosts."
74',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Stephan Lichtsteiner sub-in Andrea Barzagli . Dybala does well to bring the ball away on the counter for the home side, with the ex-Palermo forward showing great awareness. Asamoah then puts the ball out of play to allow Barzagli to come into the game - which suggests that Lichtsteiner has an injury problem."
72',action,"Mandzukic is the target of a long diagonal ball into the penalty box, but the Croatian's knock-down is gobbled up straight away by a very receptive Marchetti. Less than 20 minutes remain for the away side to try and turn this scoreline around, but it isn't looking likely at all."
71',action,"Lichtsteiner is invited down the right-hand side yet again, with Juventus looking to build patiently from the back. The home side are well on their way to their 27th consecutive league win in this stadium. Allegri will be pleased with how his players responded to a furious start to the second half."
69',action,"Higuain is the target of a long ball forward, but Patric is easily able to take control and slot a pass back to his goalkeeper. Juventus are leaving their star striker up top essentially alone, but a third goal would go a long way to killing Lazio's belief."
67',action,"Juventus win themselves a free-kick on the right-hand side, but Pjanic's delivery is flicked away from the danger zone. Inzaghi has re-shuffle his side a little bit, with Djordevic now being allowed to partner Immobile up top. Lazio are throwing caution to the wind somewhat already."
66',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Cristiano Lombardi sub-in Alessandro Murgia . Lombardi is replaced after really disappointing, with Murgia coming into the game on the right-hand side."
66',action,"Anderson manages to find Milinkovic-Savic on the edge of the penalty box, but Mandzukic tracks back brilliantly to outmuscle the Serbian midfielder. Buffon is waiting for his first tough save of the afternoon."
64',action,"Mandzukic is picked out at the back post, but his firm header is blocked well by Patric. Juventus are looking more resurgent now, with Lazio's long spell on the front foot coming to an end. Allegri's men are looking comfortable again."
63',action,"Lichtsteiner breaks down the right-hand side, before combining with Cuadrado, but a cross from the Colombian is nodded clear by Patric. Moments later, Asamoah threatens down the left, but Patric does brilliantly to deny the Ghana international."
61',action,"Just wide from Dybala! Higuain plays a wonderful throughball in behind, after his compatriot slotted a well-weight pass into a dangerous area. Dybala gets on to it, but stabbed a rush finish beyond the left-hand post."
60',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Lucas Rodrigo Biglia sub-in Filip Đorđević . Biglia is taken off, after disappointing this afternoon, with Djordevic adding another offensive presence into the mix."
60',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Ştefan Daniel Radu sub-in Jordan Zacharie Lukaku Menama Mokelenge . Radu is replaced by Lukaku, as the Romanian full-back was riskily on a yellow card."
60',action,"Patric leads the charge for Lazio, before finding Immobile in the box, but the former Borussia Dortmund striker isn't allowed to turn. Instead, he feeds a low pass out to Lombardi, who then plays a terrible cross straight out for a goal-kick. Yet another disappointing contribution."
59',action,"Juventus are being forced to make a few mistakes in midfield. Biglia takes aim from 30 yards out, but the Lazio midfielder watches his dipping effort sail just shy of the right-hand post. Buffon was a little bit concerned there. The hosts respond with an attack of their own, but Cuadrado continues to run into dead ends."
57',action,"Lombardi sprints down the right-hand side and gets into the box, before being outmuscled by Asamoah with ease. The Lazio winger claims for a penalty, but a poor touch from the Italian meant that the Juventus left-back could take control of the situation. It was rather risky from the Ghanaian, however."
56',action,"Juventus are enjoying a little bit more of the ball, as they try to take back some control in this contest, with Lazio unable to make the most of an intense start to the second half. Dybala tries to cause some problems when cutting in from the right, but the Argentine runs into traffic and is tackled."
54',action,"Milinkovic-Savic tries to flick a header into Immobile's path, but Bonucci hacks clear. Juventus respond with a counter-attack, which finds Dybala on the edge of the area, but the Argentina international drills a low shot wide of the far post."
53',action,"Anderson shoots from the left-hand side, but Buffon makes a simple save to deny him. The Juventus goalkeeper has been the more worried of the two in this second half. The hosts are yet to create anything, with Dybala dropping in to help out defensively."
51',action,"Lombardi releases Immobile forward, with a cross eventually whipped in from deep by Milinkovic-Savic. The Lazio striker tries to meet it, but the Italian can't rise high enough to use his head. Inzaghi will be pleased with how his team have flown forward since the restart."
50',action,"Patric finds Lombardi on the right, who bends in a cross, but Lichsteiner nods clear. Moments later, Anderson shoots from 20 yards out, but blasts high and wide of the target. Lazio are pushing on and causing a few more problems in the early stages of this second half."
49',action,"Bonucci takes a poor touch, which allows for Anderson to dance his way forward, but the Brazilian can only pick out Milinkovic-Savic. Lazio work the ball out to the right, but a cross from Lombardi is blocked by Asamoah. A second delivery is curled in, but Immobile can't get anywhere near it."
47',action,"Radu flashes a cross in from the left-hand side, after getting in behind Lichtsteiner easily, but Chiellini makes a timely headed intervention at the near post. Lazio take the resulting corner short, which is eventually whipped into the box, but a header from Wallace is claimed simply by Buffon."
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half! Juventus have a commanding lead, but Lazio will be approaching this next 45 minutes with their coach's half-time words ringing in their ears. The visitors haven't been aggressive nor adventurous enough to unsettle the Bianconeri."
,action,"HALF-TIME! Juventus head into the break with a 2-0 lead over Lazio, courtesy of early strikes from Dybala and Higuain. The away side haven't managed to truly test Buffon yet, with the away side not deserving to be in with a shout of turning this one around so far. Allegri will be pleased, it has been plain sailing for an experiemental line-up in Turin."
45'+1',action,There are two minutes of first-half stoppage time.
45',action,"Radu tries to drill in a cross from the left-hand side, but Bonucci is easily able to block it at the near post. Moments later, Patric bends a cross in from the opposite flank, with Chiellini and Khedira clashing heads while trying to clear it. The Juventus duo colliding nastily there, and they will both need a spot of treatment as a result."
43',action,"Mandzukic goes down with a foot problem, after being accidentally stepped on, but the Croatian striker should be fine to continue. Juventus are happy to play all the way back to their goalkeeper, as Allegri's men try and see out this half calmly."
41',action,"Asamoah gets forward down the left, but an eventual cross from Dybala is half-cleared. Juventus are dominating possession and ensuring that they head towards the half-time break in control. Bonucci is picked out by a cross from the right-hand side, but the centre-back can only guide a volley just shy of the far post."
39',action,"Immobile is released down the left-hand side, with Buffon deciding to rush out to meet him. The Italy international goalkeeper dives into a risky sliding tackle, getting none of the ball, but the veteran was fortunate not to catch the Lazio striker either."
38',action,"Since taking a two-goal lead, Juventus have been guilty of taking their foot off the gas a little bit, but Buffon remains untested in the hosts' net. Higuain is released forward on the counter-attack, before holding the ball up well against Wallace, but Allegri's men are then more than content to play backwards and calm things down. Less than 10 minutes remain until the interval."
36',action,"Parolo has a shot from 20 yards out, but drills his effort into a ruck of bodies, before the rebound falls out to Patric, who has a cross-cum-shot deflected wide. The corner is taken short and then whipped into the back-post area, but Asamoah heads behind. The second set-piece delivery finds Anderson in space on the edge of the box, but his low volley is blocked. Lazio can't find a way through."
34',action,"Biglia tries to release Immobile in behind, but Chiellini makes a good interception, before Juventus head up the other end. Wallace then steps out of his back four to do the same for the Biancocelesti. The away side find Patric out on the right, but a cross from the former Barcelona youngster is nodded to safety by Chiellini."
32',action,"Buffon is yet to have anything to do in the Juventus net, with Marchetti similarly just needing to pick the ball out of his own net on two occasions. Milinkovic-Savic is fed into the clear and juggles his way beyond Chiellini, but the Bianconeri goalkeeper just has to come out quickly to gobble up the loose ball."
30',action,"OFFSIDE! Higuain has the ball in the back of the net once again, but his goal is ruled out. The Argentina international was picked out by a great free-kick delivery from Dybala, but his compatriot strayed narrowly the wrong side of the last man when the dead-ball was delivered, before finishing well."
28',action,"Cuadrado is released in behind Radu, before dancing into the box and setting a pass back to Higuain. The Argentine striker sends an awful cross into the area, which Mandzukic just manages to keep in on the far side, before Lombardi is penalised for a push on Asamoah. The resulting dead-ball is whipped in by Dybala, but Parolo heads clear at the near post."
26',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ciro Immobile. Immobile picks up a yellow card for dissent, after arguing with the referee. The Italy international wasn't happy with a tackle from Pjanic, which caught him late and went unpunished."
25',action,"Milinkovic-Savic dances to the edge of the Juventus penalty area, and appears to get blocked off, but the referee doesn't award a foul.

Chiellini half-clears, with Milinkovic-Savic taking control of the ball from 20 yards out, but the Serbian midfielder shoots narrowly wide of the left-hand post."
23',action,"Patric is shaken off easily by Mandzukic, with Juve slowly building play out to the right-hand side. Lichtsteiner tries to lift a searching pass over Radu for Cuadrado, but De Vrij comes across to intercept. Lazio respond with a counter-attack, but the Switzerland international does well to deny Immobile."
21',action,"Lichtsteiner gives the ball away cheaply, but Cuadrado tracks back to help out his right-back and foul the advancing Radu. Lazio try and mount an attack of their own, with Lombardi sprinting down the right, but the young wide man runs the ball out of play disappointingly."
19',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ştefan Daniel Radu. Radu picks up the first yellow card of the game for a rash challenge. The resulting free-kick is whipped in by Pjanic, but it sails out of play."
18',action,"Lazio are struggling to deal with Juventus' attacking line-up, with Dybala and Higuain causing quite a few problems. With Pjanic being given the time and space to dictate play from deep, the away side are almost constantly finding themselves under pressure."
16',assist,"Assist Juan Guillermo Cuadrado Bello. Cuadrado combines with Lichtsteiner, before curling a brilliant cross into the awkward zone between a goalkeeper and his defence."
16',goal,"Goal Gonzalo Gerardo Higuaín. GOOOOOOOOOAL! HIGUAIN MAKES IT 2-0! The Argentina international is picked out by a searching cross from the right-hand side, which Higuain rifles home without a second thought. He gets ahead of De Vrij and stabs a low finish beyond a helpless Marchetti."
15',action,"Cuadrado and Lichtsteiner combine down the right-hand side, but the former plays an inaccurate pass infield to the underlapping full-back. Dybala and Higuain are being left up top at the moment, with Mandzukic filling in on the left-hand side of midfield. Thus far, the rather experimental system has worked well."
13',action,"Finally, after a breathless first 10 minutes for the away side, Lazio enjoy a slow and patient spell of possession. Inzaghi's men are struggling to create anything, with Lombardi and Anderson unable to get any joy in the wide areas so far. For the most part, Juve are sticking with a four-man defence."
11',action,"Lazio have been playing with their backs exclusively to the wall so far, with Allegri's men calling all of the shots. Cuadrado goes down heavily, after Radu accidentally treads on the Colombian's calf, but the ex-Chelsea winger shakes off the issue. Nothing comes of the resulting free-kick, and the visitors counter, but Immobile is forced backwards immediately."
9',action,"There is a brief stoppage in play, as Wallace goes down with a knee problem, but the centre-back appears to be okay to continue. With Dusan Basta already injured, Lazio can't afford to lose him. Lichtsteiner bursts down the right and angles in a cross, but De Vrij hacks half-clear, before a second dangerous delivery is headed away by Wallace."
7',action,"Juventus have been dominating from the off, with the hosts having all of the ball and asking all of the questions. Lazio just haven't been able to get their foot on it, and as a result the away side have been unable to settle down."
5',assist,"Assist Mario Mandžukić. Mandzukic knocks the ball down kindly for his teammate, justifying his selection up top."
5',goal,"Goal Paulo Bruno Dybala. GOOOOOOOOOAL! DYBALA MAKES IT 1-0! Play is opened out to the right-hand side, finding Lichtsteiner, who lifts a pass to the edge of the penalty area towards Mandzukic. The Croatia international nods an intelligent header down to Dybala, who drills a half-volleyed finish into the bottom-left corner. Great finish!"
4',action,"Juventus win themselves a deep free-kick, but the hosts see their set-piece delivery swung into the box and then immediately cleared. Lazio respond with an attack of their own, with Milinkovic-Savic swinging in a cross, but Buffon is there to make a simple catch in the glaring afternoon sun."
2',action,"Two huge tackles fly in during the opening couple of minutes, with Biglia and Bonucci putting themselves around from the off. Stephan Lichsteiner appears to be playing as a third centre-back when Juventus lose possession, but otherwise the Switzerland international and Asamoah push right on."

,action,"TEAM NEWS: Kwadwo Asamoah starts at left-back for Juventus, with Stephan Lichtsteiner preferred to Dani Alves on the opposite flank. Miralem Pjanic and Sami Khedira should play the deeper midfield roles, allowing for Paulo Dybala, Mario Mandzukic and Juan Cuadrado to support Gonzalo Higuain. Allegri has gone with a rather offensive starting line-up today. Daniele Rugani and Andrea Barzagli are on the bench, but the hosts go with a four-man defence."
