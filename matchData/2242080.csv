,action,"FULL-TIME! Everton ensure that they can keep themselves just about in the race for European football with a 3-1 win over Burnley, but Arsenal and Manchester United still have a few games in hand on the Toffees. Goals from Jagielka, Lukaku and a Ben Mee own goal were enough to help the hosts to their eighth straight win at Goodison Park, despite a Vokes penalty making things briefly complicated. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+3',action,"Lukaku is given some service in the penalty area, but the can only swivel to see a shot blocked."
90'+2',action,"Koeman is now calmly sat on his bench, with Everton happy to see this game out in patient fashion. Lukaku holds the ball up well, before finding Schneiderlin in the centre of the park, but the Frenchman looks backwards. Job done, it's just a case of getting to the final whistle unscathed."
90'+1',action,There are three minutes of stoppage time.
90',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Ross Barkley sub-in Ademola Lookman . Barkley takes his leave, getting a standing ovation on his way off, with Lookman introduced."
88',action,"Off the line from Barkley! The Everton midfielder is there again for the home side, as a second looping header from Keane is denied. He has really dug in to contribute well defensively this afternoon."
86',substitution,Substitution sub-out Jeff Hendrick sub-in Ashley Westwood . Hendrick is replaced by Westwood for the last few minutes. The Republic of Ireland international was very quiet today in terms of creating anything offensively.
85',action,"Robles is very happy to take his time over a goal kick now, with Everton easing into cruise control. Barry's introduction has just meant that Burnley are happy to keep hold of the ball and not necessarily force the issue."
83',substitution,Substitution sub-out Ashley Barnes sub-in Daniel Agyei . Barnes is replaced by young Agyei for the dying minutes at Goodison Park.
83',action,"Less than 10 minutes remain for Burnley to try and turn this game around, but it doesn't look likely at all. Lukaku is picked out by a quick ball over the top, but the Belgian is caught offside yet again. The chances have dried up a little for Everton, but Koeman won't mind given his side's two-goal cushion."
81',action,"Gray causes some problems with his pace on the break, with Barry forced to cynically drag the Burnley striker to the ground. Brady whips in the free-kick from the right-hand side, but his delivery dips straight behind for a goal-kick. What a waste."
79',action,"Barton is felled by a terribly timed tackle by Valencia on the edge of the Everton penalty area, despite there not being any real contact at all. The English midfielder takes aim, but shoots straight into a ruck of bodies."
77',action,"Everton are in total control here, with Burnley having absolutely no answer to the continual pressure from the Toffees. More goals looks extremely likely, the floodgates could be open at Goodison Park before long."
76',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Kevin Mirallas sub-in Gareth Barry . Mirallas is replaced by Barry, as Koeman looks to solidify the centre of his midfield."
74',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Sam Vokes sub-in Andre Gray . Gray is introduced into the fray for Vokes, as Dyche freshens things up in attack. The Burnley substitute has just 15 minutes to try and help Burnley turn things around."
74',goal,"Goal Romelu Lukaku Menama. GOOOOOOOOOAL! LUKAKU MAKES IT 3-1! What a strike from the Belgium international, who turns smartly beyond Keane in the box and then holds his man off. He stabs the ball home with incredible force, Heaton didn't have a chance."
74',assist,"Assist Leighton Baines. Baines cuts a pass infield from the left-hand side, but Lukaku does all of the hard work to fashion a chance for himself."
72',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ross Barkley. Barkley gets a yellow card for his celebrations, as he climbed into the foot of the stand behind Heaton's goal."
71',own-goal,"Own Goal Ben Mee. GOOOOOOOOAL! BARKLEY TURNS HOME WITH SOME HELP! Mirallas tees up the England international, who blasts a 15-yard effort at goal. it strikes both Keane and Mee, before looping over the wrongfooted body of Heaton. That is desperately unlucky for the visitors."
70',action,"Mirallas tries to unleash an effort from the edge of the 18-yard effort, but once again he is denied by a block. The home fans are getting a little bit frustrated with how Everton are being shut up by Burnley. Barton goes in high on Schneiderlin, but escapes a booking."
68',action,"Barkley cuts in from the left-hand side and drops a shoulder, before seeing a low shot blocked. Everton continue to retain possession and control proceedings. Burnley have their two banks of four camped right on the edge of their penalty area at the moment."
66',action,"Burnley are trying to be direct and cause problems, but they're not winning the second balls in midfield anymore. Vokes and Barnes are becoming a little bit isolated from the rest of the unit. Everton are in control here."
64',action,"Lukaku is picked out by a good early cross from the right-hand side, but he can only turn a glancing header into Heaton's arms from an offside position. Everton are pushing on brilliantly and asking Burnley plenty of questions. Blocks galore on the visiting 18-yard line."
62',action,"Lukaku releases Valencia down the right flank, but Keane manages to nip back to make a great challenge on the Ecuadorian substitute. Davies opens play out to the opposite flank moments later, before a cut-back from Baines finds Mirallas. His initial shot from a right angle is blocked, before a second forces a brilliant save out of Heaton!"
60',action,"Valencia drifts in from the right-hand side and belts a left-footed effort goalwards, but Keane steps across to make a brilliant block. Half an hour remains for the hosts to force the issue, but Burnley are defending very resiliently indeed."
58',action,"Mirallas takes aim from just inside the penalty area, after a good pass into the box from Barkley, but a low shot from the Belgian is straight at Heaton. He should have done much, much better with that. Disappointing attempt, all told."
56',action,"Barton tries his luck from long-range, but the English midfielder blazes harmlessly over the crossbar. The first 10 minutes of this second half have been extremely hard-fought, as the Clarets continue to dig in and give as good as they're getting."
54',action,"Everton immediately get back on the ball and look to pose more threats to Burnley, but that penalty has been a real hindrance. Jagielka's goal had given them a vital breakthrough, but that moment of madness from Robles has turned things right around. Dyche's men have a lifeline. Brady curls in a great delivery that Baines is forced to put behind."
52',penalty-goal,Penalty Goal Sam Vokes. GOOOOOOAL! VOKES MAKES IT 1-1! Robles is totally at fault there. The Burnley striker sends the Spaniard the wrong way and tucks home a neat finish. The visitors are level again. Koeman will be absolutely fuming.
50',action,"PENALTY TO BURNLEY! Robles looks confused, but the referee didn't hesitate. Vokes gallops into the box and is running away from goal, but the Everton goalkeeper slides through the back of his man. Madness!"

49',goal,"Goal Phil Jagielka. GOOOOOOOAL! JAGIELKA SCORES AGAIN! Valencia forces Heaton into a near-post save, before Lukaku sees a shot blocked. Holgate picks up the scraps and earns Everton a corner, as the hosts continue to pile forward. The Toffees captain manages to scrappily knock a back-post header into the back of the net!"
47',action,"Baines whips in a dangerous cross from the right-hand side, which swings in dangerously. Williams flicks it on to the back post well, with Mee making a vital intervention ahead of Valencia to clear behind for a corner - which comes to nothing."
46',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Idrissa Gana Gueye sub-in Enner Remberto Valencia Lastra . Valencia replaces Gueye, as Koeman looks to take the game to Burnley a little. Barkley moves infield as a result."
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half on Merseyside! Everton will be hoping to take their momentum from the end of the first into the remainder of the game, but Burnley are always a tough nut to crack."
,action,"HALF-TIME! It remains goalless at the break at Goodison Park, with Everton and Burnley battling desperately to try and break the deadlock. Keane had a header cleared off the line by Barkley, with Vokes missing two good opportunities, before the hosts got themselves into the game and put on a lot of pressure in the last 10 minutes. This one could go either way!"
45',action,There is one minute of stoppage time in this first half.
44',action,"Just wide from Mirallas! The Belgian winger tries his luck from a 25-yard free-kick, which takes a nick off the wall and loops just over the top-right corner. That was centimetres away. Everton take the resulting corner, which falls out to Barkley, but a shot from the Englishman is lashed over the bar."
42',action,"Gueye slices wide! The ball sits up kindly for the Everton midfielder, but his attempted half-volley won't live long in the memory. Barton gives away a free-kick deep on the left-hand side, which Barkley stands over. The England international bends in a cross, but it fails to beat the first man."
41',action,"Everton work the ball out to the left-hand side, before Barkley approaches the penalty area and gets tackled by Lowton. Davies drills in a low cross from the rebound, but Mee clears at Burnley's near post. Suddenly, it is Dyche's men who are struggling to not remain deep."
39',action,"Mirallas tries his luck from inside the box, after nice link-up play between the Belgian and his compatriot Lukaku, but a block denies him. Everton are starting to turn the screw, with endless deliveries being lifted up into Lukaku's vicinity. The home fans are responding!"
37',action,"Baines hangs a cross up to the back post from the left-hand side, but Lukaku can only clamber up above his man to plant a looping header over the crossbar. Everton are growing into this game a little more, and Burnley might come to rue their missed early opportunities."
35',action,"Once again, Jagielka is forced to chase back and this time deny Vokes, as Burnley keep failing to take advantage of their period of pressure. Dyche's men just can't seem to put their opponents to the sword. Barkley finds Holgate on the edge of the box, before a low shot from the right-back is pushed to safety by a full-stretch Heaton!"
33',action,"Everton keep giving away fouls in perfect areas for Burnley, but this time a lofted cross from Barton is caught simply by Robles. Moments later, Vokes gets in behind down the left channel, before being forced wide by Jagielka. The visiting striker tries to lift a finish over the advanced goalkeeper, but the Spanish shot-stopper stands tall to make a vital save."
31',action,"Barkley tries to shoot through some bodies from around 30 yards out, but predictably it gets blocked. Mirallas picks up the scraps and manages to earn his side a corner on the right, however. Two consecutive deliveries into the Burnley box come to nothing for the Toffees."
29',yellow-card,Yellow Card Idrissa Gana Gueye. Gueye gets a yellow card for a poor challenge in quite a dangerous area of the field.
28',action,"Another free-kick is pumped into the box from deep by Burnley, with Vokes able to nod a knock-down into a dangerous area. Holgate is the first man to react and clear, however. Dyche's men are a nuisance."
26',action,"The resulting set-piece is cleared by Barkley's head, with the England international doing more defensively than in attack so far this afternoon. Baines is found out on the left, and combines with Mirallas, but a trick from the Belgian doesn't quite come off and the visitors win possession back."
25',action,"Baines whips in a free-kick from high on the right-hand side, but Heaton comes out to parry the ball to safety. Gueye picks up the ball on the edge of the box, but a shot from the ex-Aston Villa midfielder is blocked by Barton. Burnley attempt to counter and win themselves a corner as a result, after good work from Boyd."
23',action,"Burnley are pressing well, with a dangerous looking attack for the hosts turning into the Clarets forcing them all the way back to Robles in the end. Everton just can't seem to string any passages of play together that stretch into the final third. Holgate's crosses from the right have been their only threat."
21',action,"Brady tries to bend in a cross from the left, but Barkley charges it down well, with Burnley still finding themselves firmly on the front foot. Everton just haven't quite got going. Keane has been equal to everything that the Toffees have come up with."
19',action,"Brady cuts in from the right-hand side, but the Irishman's curling left-footed effort sails quite a way shy of the top corner. Burnley continue to be a real threat from deep. Lowton whips in a beautiful cross from the right, but neither Vokes, Barnes nor Brady can get on the end of it at the back post!"
17',action,"Burnley win themselves yet another free-kick in a dangerous area, with Brady opting to shoot from around 35 yards out. The ex-Norwich winger clips the wall with his shot, however, which loops behind for a corner. The same man takes the set-piece, with Keane seeing a powerful back-post header cleared off the line by Barkley!"
15',action,"Lukaku is the target of a cross from the right-hand side, with Heaton steaming off his line and into traffic without really palming the ball away from danger.

A bit brighter from the home side, with Gueye forcing a simple stop out of the Burnley goalkeeper from range moments later."
13',action,"Burnley continue to see more of the ball, with Dyche's men starting this game brilliantly. The hosts will be worried that they are a little sleepy in these early stages. It hasn't quite come off yet, but the partnership of Vokes and Barnes is causing a few issues for Jagielka and Williams."

Holgate overlaps and finds the Belgian lurking, but the ex-Chelsea striker directs the ball straight down Heaton's throat."
3',action,"Burnley win themselves a couple of early free-kicks, which allow the away side to load the box. On both occasions, however, Everton easily clear their lines. It's a good start from Dyche's men, as they look to ruffle a few feathers from the outset."
