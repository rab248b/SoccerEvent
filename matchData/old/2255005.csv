Leverkusen have played positively and have done well to cause Bayern problems, with Calhanoglu taking advantage of poor defending to fire in a great equaliser.

,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"Bayern have dominated this fixture in recent years, but Leverkusen will be well aware of their opponents’ current frailty. Today’s visitors have only won once away to the Reds in the last 27 years, with that victory coming back in October 2012, but they did taste victory last year with a 2-0 win at the BayArena."
,action,"As for Leverkusen, they’ve suffered a mixed start to the campaign and currently sit in a disappointing ninth place as a result, with six points currently separating them and a Champions League qualification spot. Last weekend saw them fail to extend their winning run to three games after losing 3-2 at home to Leipzig, but they will be high in spirits after Tuesday’s 1-1 draw against CSKA Moscow confirmed their place in the knockout stage of the Champions League."
,action,"Another defeat today would mark their first back-to-back league losses since May 2015 and would not only leave them far behind Leipzig but would also leave them equal on points with Eintracht Frankfurt, who picked up a huge win against Dortmund this afternoon. As a result, a win today is imperative if Bayern are to get their stuttering season back on track."
,action,"It’s not been a great start to life in Munich for Carlo Ancelotti, who is already having to face questions about his future after an unconvincing four months in charge. Last weekend’s 1-0 defeat away to Borussia Dortmund means that they currently sit six points behind Bundesliga leaders RB Leipzig, whilst the shock midweek loss against Rostov has resulted in them having to settle for second place in their Champions League group."
,action,Good evening and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Bundesliga game between Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen at the Allianz Arena.
