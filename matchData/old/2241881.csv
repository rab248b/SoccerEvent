,action,"And that will do it from Stamford Bridge as Chelsea hold onto their comeback, beating Tottenham 2-1 to retake the Premier League lead. Eriksen's early goal seemed to signal an upset for a dominant Spurs team, but the home side turned it on when needed, striking through Pedro and Moses to seal their seventh straight win. That's all we've got time for, thanks for tuning in!"
90'+2',action,"A turnover in midfield presents Chelsea with a late chance to add a third goal as Oscar sprays it to Costa. He goes on one of his typical driving runs, head down, which takes him to the top of the box. However, his cross is intercepted well by Winks."
90',action,"Willian had a chance to wrap things up here as he got beyond his marker, but his cross did not find a teammate, instead heading narrowly off the mark. We're on the cusp of stoppage time now."
87',action,"FIRST OPENING IN A WHILE! Chelsea are done apart by an energetic run from the substitute N'Koudou, but he takes it a step too far, trying to beat Courtois when a pass to a teammate would have been a better option."
85',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Willian Borges Da Silva.Wimmer tries to start a move out of the back but he's got Willian for company. The Brazilian makes no attempt to play the ball, dragging back the defender, and is booked for that."
83',substitution,Substitution Pedro Eliezer Rodríguez Ledesma Oscar dos Santos Emboaba Júnior .Another change that could probably be classed as defensive - Oscar is introduced in place of Pedro.
83',substitution,"Substitution Moussa Sidi Yaya Dembélé Vincent Janssen .Dembele heads off to be replaced by Vincent Janssen, who immediately joins Kane up front as Pochettino rolls the dice."
82',action,"It's all Tottenham in terms of possession at the moment, but very little penetration. Unlike the first half when Chelsea were getting played off the park, the home fans are more comfortable with this development."
81',substitution,Substitution Victor Moses Branislav Ivanović .Time for Chelsea to make some changes. Moses heads off with Ivanovic coming on in a clear defensive switch.
79',action,Pochettino looks frustrated on the sidelines as his team lack the ideas to break down the opposition. I'm finding it hard to see where a breakthrough will come from for the visiting team.
77',substitution,"Substitution Eden Hazard Willian Borges Da Silva .Hazard's race is run, and Willian comes on to solidify things in the closing stages."
76',action,"The strength in depth is night and day when looking at both benches. Chelsea began the game with the likes of Willian, Fabregas and Oscar in reserve, while Tottenham's best option was probably Winks, who only made his full debut last week."
74',action,"There's a glimpse of a chance there for Diego Costa, as he latches onto a cross inside the area, but a deflection takes the sting out of it and sees it bobble wide. Chelsea still have prowess on the break."
73',substitution,Substitution Bamidele Alli Georges-Kevin N'Koudou Mbida .Georges-Kevin K'Koudou has been summoned off the bench to replace Alli.
71',action,The tempo of the game has died down here as Tottenham struggle to break down a determined Chelsea rearguard. This is more like the outfit that have went just over 10 hours without conceding.
69',action,"Should Chelsea hold on and win this game, then they will move back to the top of the Premier League by a point. Tottenham will stay fifth, five ahead of Manchester United but facing the prospect of a four-point gap to Arsenal by the end of the weekend."
67',action,"It's been an absorbing contest at Stamford Bridge, and it's so finely balanced at the moment. Chelsea are sitting back and almost daring Tottenham to try and pass their way through their ranks of blue."
65',substitution,Substitution Heung-Min Son Harry Winks .Son will depart for Winks as Pochettino tries to switch things up.
64',action,"Do Spurs have enough in their tank to come back from this? They may feel that they've weathered the worst of the Chelsea storm, and they're back in possession for long spells now."
62',action,"COURTOIS TESTED! Kane finds a pocket of space in the opposition defensive third, and decides to set Eriksen up for a close-range effort. It's volleyed at goal, but the keeper is equal to it."
60',action,"One hour gone here in London and Chelsea have turned this around to lead the derby 2-1. Tottenham need something to change soon, but there's not a lot on the bench for them to get excited about."
57',action,"Tottenham are being played off the park in a complete role reversal from the opening period. It's they now who are conceding too much space between their midfield and defence, and they suddenly look very narrow."
55',action,"THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THREE! Moses drifts wide to allow Hazard space centrally. Costa also heads out to the right flank, and he gets the ball to squeeze a cross into the area for Alonso, who leans back and puts it over!"
53',action,"Now we will see what Tottenham are made of as Chelsea swarm all over them. Remember that Spurs were by far the better side for long spells in the first half, but two goals either side of the break has turned this game on its head."
51',assist,"Assist Diego Da Silva Costa.Again, fantastic work from Costa to punish a static defence."
51',goal,"Goal Victor Moses.VICTOR MOSES MAKES IT 2-1! Costa did all the hard work, but where was the Tottenham defence? The Spaniard drives down the left, Dier drops off and Dembele is too slow to cover. He gets to the byline and squares it to the back post where Moses just about squeezes it home!"
48',action,"N'Golo Kante cuts across a shot that ends up as easy pickings for Lloris. It's a solid start to the second half from Chelsea, who haven't made any changes and appear to have stuck with the same system."
46',action,We're off again.
,action,"The Chelsea fans applaud their side off the field for the break as they get themselves on the board with one of the last kicks of the period. Two fantastic goals in this game, from Eriksen and Pedro, have left things finely poised. Tottenham were the better side, but they'll have to start at square one again."
45',goal,"Goal Pedro Eliezer Rodríguez Ledesma.WONDERFUL GOAL AND IT'S ALL SQUARE! Matic plays the ball to Pedro, who twists and turns outside the area, setting the ball up onto his right boot and curls one into the far corner!"
45',assist,Assist Nemanja Matić.Matic got the ball to Pedro.
43',action,"Chelsea push forward with one of the last attacks of the first half, and the ball sets up for Hazard at the top of the box. However, his low shot is no match for Hugo Lloris, who gets down well."
41',action,"Dembele sends another effort off target, but Pochettino will be delighted with what he's seen from his side in this game. Strong defence, overwhelming midfield, and a clinical finish when it mattered."
39',action,"A fantastic ball sent diagonally to the right flank sees Walker speeding to catch up, and he touches it back superbly into the path of Eriksen. The Dane has another drive from distance, but that one is still rising."
37',action,"The diagonal ball from Kevin Wimmer is an excellent one, which Alli controls inside the area, but all his momentum is taking him away from the ball. He goes down, but neither he nor his teammates show much interest in appealing for a penalty."
35',action,"ANOTHER TOTTENHAM SHOT! They're peppering away at Chelsea's goal, but have found Courtois in their way at almost every turn. Kane doesn't have a lot of room to operate from 18 yards, but he still manages to shoot on the turn, but the keeper pushes it over."
33',action,"COURTOIS CALLED INTO ACTION AGAIN! Walker leaves Alonso eating his dust out wide, and decides to take matters into his own hand even more with a hammer blow that the keeper saves, before he's in the right position again to collect Dier's header from the resulting corner."
30',action,"Chelsea win a free-kick in a position that may be a little too far for a shot for a regular player, but not for David Luiz. The Brazilian sends the ball swerving towards goal, but Courtois isn't fooled."
28',action,"The home fans aren't happy with what they've seen here, and are urging their team to play with more tempo. It's been so easy for Tottenham to get players back in defensive positions when they lose the ball."
26',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Moussa Sidi Yaya Dembélé.Dembele is a little late going into Alonso, and he is shown the visitors' first yellow card of the game. Spurs racked up nine bookings in their last trip to this ground."
23',action,"Tottenham often have a spare man in midfield whenever they attack, but Chelsea will be happy to have that player be Wanyama. The midfielder is afforded the space to have a crack from distance, but sends it well over."
21',action,"Chelsea have done well to settle down in the last few minutes, shutting down the gaps in midfield that enabled Tottenham initially to find so much space. Still only Eriksen's goal in this."
19',yellow-card,"Yellow Card David Luiz Moreira Marinho.Chelsea win a free-kick after lunging at Kane, which leaves him one booking away from a suspension. Strangely, the referee dropped the card on the ground, Luiz handed it to him and got it flashed in his face."
17',action,"Tonight's match sees the league's two-best defences square off against each other. Tottenham have conceded a Premier-League low eight goals in 12 games, while Chelsea have only let in one more."
15',action,"Chelsea's formation is not working, as Tottenham's plethora of midfielders are able to dominate possession and keep them on the back foot. What's more, there's space in front of Thibaut Courtois and his defence."
13',action,"Son plays the ball to Kane, who flicks it to Eriksen. The Dane takes aim from distance again, but a deflection takes the venom off that one, although Chelsea still have a corner to defend."
11',assist,Assist Bamidele Alli.Alli played the ball quickly to Eriksen.
11',goal,"Goal Christian Dannemann Eriksen.LOVELY OPENING GOAL! Chelsea couldn't quite make it to 11 hours without conceding as they allow too much space for Eriksen at the top of the box, and he pings a great left footer into the near corner!"
9',action,"Dier lashes a free-kick high into the stands as Tottenham continue to dominate this game. Chelsea have barely had a kick, but they've just made it past 10 hours without conceding a goal in the league."
7',action,"Good start to this game from Tottenham, and they were very close to an opening goal on that last play. This is their third straight London derby in the Premier League, after beating West Ham and drawing against Arsenal."
5',action,"THE FLAG IS UP! Christian Eriksen's free-kick isn't defended properly by the Chelsea backline, and it falls to Harry Kane in close, who converts. However, his celebrations are cut shot by the offside flag."
3',action,"Costa goes down in a heap after an aerial challenge with Eric Dier, and he's complaining of an elbow from the Tottenham defender. The referee opts against making such an important call this early though."
1',action,Off we go!
,action,"With injuries and suspensions mounting for Tottenham, Mauricio Pochettino has opted to shoehorn his best available players into his XI in what looks like a midfield-heavy lineup. Christian Eriksen, Dele Alli, Heung-min Son, Moussa Dembele and Victor Wanyama all start, while Harry Winks returns to the bench."
,action,"Willian, Oscar and Cesc Fabregas make up a strong bench for Chelsea, as Conte lines up with three up front in Pedro, Diego Costa and Eden Hazard. Victor Moses and Marcos Alonso will function as de-facto wing-backs this evening."
,action,"Tottenham subs: Janssen, Vorm, K'Koudou, Trippier, Onomah, Winks, Carter-Vickers."
,action,"Tottenham (3-4-2-1): Lloris; Dier, Wimmer, Vertonghen; Walker, Wanyama, Dembele, Son; Eriksen, Alli; Kane."
,action,"Chelsea subs: Begovic, Ivanovic, Fabregas, Oscar, Willian, Batshuayi, Chabolah."
,action,"Chelsea (3-4-3): Courtois; Azpilicueta, Luiz, Cahill; Moses, Kante, Matic, Alonso; Pedro, Costa, Hazard."
,action,"Tottenham crashed out of the Champions League midweek after falling 2-1 at Monaco. Domestically, a dramatic, late 3-2 win at home to West Ham broke a long streak of draws, but was not enough for them to edge back into the top four."
,action,"Antonio Conte has presided over a six-match winning run where his side have not conceded a single goal. With Liverpool and Manchester City both winning earlier, the pressure is on to extend that streak to seven games and finish the weekend top of the pile."
