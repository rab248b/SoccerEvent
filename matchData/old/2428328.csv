,action,"That was a game of two halves for Dortmund, who struggled in the first half before improving tenfold after the break. The introduction of Pulisic made all the difference, as the young American looked dangerous every time he had the ball at his feet. In the end, costly errors would prove to be the hosts' undoing, as Monaco just about managed to hold on to take a slender lead into next week's second leg."

90'+3',action,"A hopeful lofted pass is fired up towards Aubameyang on the edge of the Monaco penalty area, but Glik is there to beat the Gabon international to the ball with a strong headed clearance. That should be that for the visitors."
90'+2',action,"Another error from Piszczek allows Mbappe to break towards the Dortmund penalty area, but this time he's well closed down by Pulisic and loses out to the young American."
90'+1',action,"What an opportunity for Aubameyang! Dortmund are unable to carve out a chance on goal from the corner, but they quickly push forward once again. Dembele then swings a wonderful cross into the box that picks out Aubameyang in front of goal, but the striker is unable to keep his headed effort down and sends it sailing over the top of the crossbar."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be three minutes of added time.
89',action,"A lovely pass is fired down the right wing and into the path of Pulisic, who quickly fires a low cross off Jemerson and out for a corner. Can the home side make it count?"
87',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Danijel Subašić ; Subasic takes slightly too long taking a goal-kick and is shown a yellow card for timewasting. Under the circumstances, he won't mind too much."
86',action,"Another dangerous cross is swung into the box by Dembele and almost picks out Aubameyang in a dangerous position, but, not for the first time this evening, Glik does well to get a head to the ball at the vital moment."

81',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Fábio Henrique Tavares ; Fabinho catches the heel of Dembele as they battle for the ball, leaving the referee with no choice but to award Dortmund a free-kick before showing the Brazilian a yellow card. The home side can't make it count, however, as Monaco have plenty of bodies back to deal with the danger."
79',goal,"Goal Kylian Mbappe Lottin ; GOAL! Mbappe makes it 3-1 against the run of play! A terrible pass from Piszczek can only pick out Mbappe, who immediately skips past Sokratis and flies towards the Dortmund penalty area. The youngster only has Burki to beat, and he manages to do so with a lovely strike that finds the top right-hand corner of the net."
77',action,"Pulisic cuts inside from the right flank and takes on Lemar, who can only poke the ball out for another Dortmund corner. It's sent into the box by Dembele and deflects out to Pulisic, who unleashes a tame volley that's easily stopped by Subasic."

72',action,"Dembele almost equalises! The youngster has looked much better since the start of the second half, and he's embarked on several dangerous runs into the Monaco box. He does so once again as he skips past Raggi and unleashes a shot, but his strike is closed down and deflects wide of the far post."
70',action,"Guerreiro's cross from the free-kick is a brilliant one and should pick out a team-mate in front of goal, but Dirar is there to head the ball away from the sea of yellow shirts camped inside the penalty area."
69',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Nabil Dirar ; Guerreiro knocks the ball down well deep down the left flank and sets up Kagawa to storm into the box, but the midfielder is quickly brought down by Dirar and instead wins another free-kick for the home side."
67',action,"Vital clearance by Moutinho! Dortmund break forward on another dangerous attack, and this time they win themselves a free-kick over on the left wing. It's swung into the box and finds Sokratis, who nods the ball down to Pulisic, but before the American can get a shot away, the ball is cleared by Moutinho."
66',substitution,"; Monaco have made their first change of the evening, with Silva making way for Nabil Dirar."
65',action,"It's been a difficult opening 20 minutes for Monaco, who are struggling to break out of their own half of the pitch. Dortmund are doing really well to put the visitors under plenty of pressure, and they look likely to score another goal again soon."
63',action,"Dembele is caught from behind by Fabinho, resulting in a free-kick for Dortmund that's taken quickly and sent short.

58',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Thomas Lemar ; Dortmund quickly regain possession before Sokratis break down the right flank, where he's clumsily bundled over by Lemar and wins his side a free-kick in a promising position."
57',assist,"Assist Shinji Kagawa ; That was a really well-worked team goal by Dortmund, but the Monaco defence really should have done better. They allowed Kagawa to break past them far too easily, and no one seemed to try and stop Dembele from finding a pocket of space in front of goal."
57',goal,"Goal Ousmane Dembélé ; GOAL! Dortmund are back in the game! Guerreiro swings a great cross into the Monaco box and towards Aubameyang, who then sets up Kagawa with a lovely back-heel.

52',action,"And now Glik comes to Monaco's rescue! Pulisic flies into the right-hand side of the penalty area on a magical run before trying to tee up Aubameyang, but this time it's Glik who denies the striker with an outstretched leg."
51',action,"Vital block by Fabinho! Dortmund move the ball around really well before Sahin fizzes a dangerous pass across the face of goal. The ball looks set to find Aubameyang, but Fabinho sticks out a foot to stop it from doing so."
49',action,"Almost a chance for Aubameyang! Raggi sends a risky pass back to Subasic that causes plenty of problems for the Monaco goalkeeper, but he's just about able to fire the ball out for a throw-in before Aubameyang can pick it up on the edge of the penalty area."
47',action,"Dembele goes close! The youngster steps up and unleashes a great curling strike, but it ends up flying just wide of the right post after leaving Subasic rooted to the spot."

He then looks up and picks out Radamel Falcao with a lovely lofted pass up towards the Dortmund box, but the striker is unable to penetrate the penalty area and quickly loses out."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be two minutes of added time.
44',action,"Almost a costly mistake by Subasic! The Monaco goalkeeper holds on to the ball inside his own box for slightly too long and is almost dispossessed by Dembele, but he's just about able to poke a pass over to Raggi before the youngster can get a toe on the ball."
43',action,"Dembele causes problems over on the right-hand side of the Monaco box before side-footing a volleyed cross towards Aubameyang, but it's easily punched away by Danijel Subasic. The youngster then fires another hopeful ball back into the penalty area, but this time it's headed away."

34',action,"Big change for Dembele! Dortmund keep pushing forward as they continue to put the Monaco back line under plenty of pressure. Piszczek cuts on to his left foot and unleashes a low strike from 25 yards out that's deflected into the path of Dembele, but as soon as the youngster pokes his follow-up strike just wide of the near post, the linesman's flag is raised for offside."

24',action,"Shinji Kagawa and Matthias Ginter link up well over on the right wing before the latter tries to skip past Andrea Raggi. He does well to head the ball behind the Italian, but he loses his footing at the vital moment and is unable to continue into the penalty area."

The youngster is in a good position in front of goal, but he's unable to test Roman Burki with his effort on goal and instead sends it looping out for a goal-kick."

,action,"Monaco have proven themselves to be one of the most exciting teams left in the competition, and that was certainly on show during February’s action-packed 5-3 defeat away to Manchester City.
