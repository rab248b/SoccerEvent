,action,"FULL-TIME! Real Madrid scrape their way to a narrow 2-1 win over Sporting, courtesy of two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo.

Ronaldo is the man to try his luck, as he searches for the all-important first goal, but Marino isn't troubled. The hosts are inviting plenty of pressure onto themselves here."
86',action,"A chance for Lucas! The Spain international is nearly picked out by a ball in from the right-hand side, but he can't get his head on the end of it with Marino at his mercy. Moments later, Marcelo tries to whip a delivery from the opposite wing, but it sails over everyone and Sporting come away with the ball."
85',action,"Only five minutes stand between Real Madrid and another important win in La Liga, to put all of the pressure on Barcelona and Atletico Madrid. isco loses out around 30 yards from goal, which leads to a break from the visitors, but Modric tracks back to make a brilliant sliding tackle."
83',action,"Sporting work their way down the right-hand side, but Douglas then loses out on the ball after dwelling on it for too long. Zidane's side are sitting very deep indeed, and the fans inside this stadium are sounding nervous. Nacho half-clears a cross from the right, before Pepe makes absolutely sure. Moments later, Navas is forced into a good save, as Cop fails to make it 2-2 from close range."

78',missed-penalty,"Missed Penalty Duje Čop.OVER THE BAR! The Croatia international steps up in the rain and blasts an awful penalty attempt high of the crossbar. Pepe reacts as though Real Madrid have just won the league. Deary me, he won't want to see that again."

76',action,"Victor drives towards the edge of the box, before feeding a low pass into Viguera, but the substitutes can't combine to good effect, as Modric makes a timely block on the edge of his own penalty area. Real Madrid are in a very precarious position here."
74',action,"Another free-kick delivery comes to nothing for the hosts, as Ronaldo clips a cross into the box that evades a few players in white shirts after skimming off the wet grass. Sporting are still in this game with a quarter of an hour on the clock - Abelardo will believe that his men can still manage to scrape a share of the spoils somehow. Despite their poor second half, they're not out of it yet."
72',substitution,"Substitution Sergio Ramos García Marcelo Vieira da Silva Júnior .Marcelo comes into the game, with Ramos coming off. That will see Nacho slot in at centre-back for the last 20 minutes or so."
72',substitution,"Substitution James David Rodríguez Rubio Marco Asensio Willemsen .James takes his leave, after failing to impress. The Bernabeu crowd react with both jeers and clapping, so it isn't too clear what they make of that change."

69',action,"Moi Gomez tries to scamper into the penalty box for Sporting, but Pepe outmuscles the Spaniard with relative ease, before slotting a pass back to Navas. James tries to link up with Benzema in a central area, but the return ball from the Frenchman is terrible - it really hasn't been his game so far."
68',action,"The away side are enjoying a bit more of the ball in the last 10 minutes, with Real Madrid happy to sit back in their banks of four and prey on opposition mistakes. Lucas is found on the right, and clips in a back-post cross, but Mere rises above Benzema to clear the danger for Sporting. Moments later, the young defender denies Ronaldo from a similar situation."
66',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Carlos Carmona Bonet.Douglas is released down the right-hand side yet again, but Pepe covers across to make a good clearance. Carmona tries to challenge for the ball, but instead catches the centre-back's knee in rash fashion, which earns him Sporting's third yellow card of the contest."
64',action,"Ramos clears the latest cross in from the right-hand side, with Danilo then able to earn a free-kick from Moi Gomez for a shove. The hosts build an attack, which sees Ronaldo picked out in the box, but the Portuguese forward can only flick a glancing header just shy of the post. Marino had that covered."
62',action,"Sporting work the ball from left to right, with Douglas invited to cross. He tries to find a back-post runs from Cop, but puts just too much pace on the delivery. That was very close, Real Madrid need to find another goal if they are to try and close this one out comfortably."
61',yellow-card,Yellow Card Rachid Aït-Atmane.Rachid is the next man to go in the referee's book this afternoon.
60',action,"Sporting try to settle themselves down with a bit of possession, but Real Madrid's banks of four are doing well to prevent their build-up play from having any joy. Isma Lopez has been dealt with more diligently this side of the break, and his fade from prominence has seen the visitors threaten much less."
58',action,"Ronaldo cuts a cross back from the left, but Amorebieta pokes a clearance halfway to safety. Lucas then has the chance to deliver from the opposite flank, but Benzema somehow manages to direct a point-blank header straight at Marino! Either side of the goalkeeper and that was 3-1."

54',action,"Alvarez is nearly picked out sliding in at the back post for the away side, but a cross from the left skims off the turf and out of play for a goal-kick. The weather is starting to have more of an effect on the run of the ball, and Zidane is off his bench at last to start giving out some instructions."
52',action,"Benzema continues to be rather anonymous up top, as much of Real Madrid's threat has come from the wide areas this afternoon. Carmona is picked out on the right, as Sporting try to break, but Danilo clears under pressure from Isma Lopez at the back post. The hosts continue to use a 4-4-2, with Ronaldo playing slightly off his French strike partner."
50',action,"James picks up a free-kick for the hosts, who are happy to stroke the ball around and keep possession moving. Zidane's men are calm and composed, to ensure that Sporting quickly forget their strong end to the first half. The rain is bucketing down in Madrid, but the pitch is holding up well for now."

,action,"HALF-TIME! Real Madrid head into the break at the Bernabeu with a 2-1 lead over Sporting, courtesy of two goals from Ronaldo.

45',action,"Mere is penalised on the right-hand side for tugging on Ronaldo's shirt, gifting the home side a chance to whip in a free-kick from the left.

Carmona gets to the byline on the break and earns his men a corner, but Navas makes a good catch."
43',action,"Diego Marino is forced into an unconvincing save from close-range, as Real Madrid continue to pile their pressure on. The hosts then clip a long ball into the box from deep, but Danilo is unable to streak down the right and prevent the overcooked pass from heading behind for a goal-kick."
41',action,"The rain continues to pour down in Madrid, with Zidane remaining under cover in his dug-out. His team are doing his job for him at the moment, while Abelardo is out getting drenched in an attempt to inspire his players to kick on.

A cross in from the left-hand side picks out Carmona's darting run into the box, which is flicked into the far corner with the touch of striker. Inspired stuff!"
34',action,"Real Madrid are continuing to play with ten men, as Pepe gets his ankle strapped up on the sideline. After the Portugal international just returned from an injury, this is the last thing that Zidane will want to see. Sporting try to make their numerical advantage count, but a cross from the left by Amorebieta is thumped away."
32',action,"Great play from Ronaldo! The Portuguese forward uses a lovely turn of pace to get down the left, before bending in an inviting cross.

The away side maintain their pressure, with Moi Gomez able to drive infield and shoot, with Navas parrying a low drive around the post. Given the moist turf, it was a case of better safe than sorry."
28',action,"Good clearance from Ramos! Isma Lopez is a threat down the left yet again, with Danilo failing to cope with his pace, but a ball in from the byline is prevented from reaching Cop by a brave intervention. In the aftermath, it appears that Pepe is moving a little gingerly, after trying to deny the initial delivery."
26',action,"Duje Cop is trying to lead some more intense pressing for the away side, but they will need to all push out higher up the field if they are to truly flummox Real Madrid in terms of passing options. Isma Lopez drives down the right, before drilling in a cross, but Sergio Ramos half-clears, before Moi Gomez sees a shot on the rebound blocked. Moments later, Cop is nearly found by a Douglas cross, but it is slightly overhit."
24',action,"Danilo is penalised for pushing through the back of Isma Lopez, as the Brazilian right-back continues to have a rather indifferent start to this game. Ronaldo is popping up all over the field - he wants this hat-trick badly. Sporting try to spark a counter-attack with a long ball over the top, but Pepe mops up for the hosts."
22',action,"Real Madrid look in the mood to score some goals today, and it doesn't appear that Sporting have got any say in the matter. All of the chances are falling the way of Zidane's men, with the away side sat so deep that Cop is the only man prepared to venture over the half-way line."
20',action,"Ronaldo is well on the way to sealing his third hat-trick in four La Liga games, and he looks very much in the mood to doing so today! Real Madrid are pushing on relentlessly, and earn themselves another corner.

18',goal,"Goal Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro.GOOOOOOOAL! TWO FOR RONALDO! The Portugal international steams into the box and thumps home a fantastic close-range header. Marino had absolutely no chance. Nacho whipped in the inviting cross, and the first goalscorer did the rest after a missed header from Amorebieta."
18',assist,Assist José Ignacio Fernández Iglesias.Nacho has the time and space to curl in a lovely cross from the left-hand side.
18',action,"Sporting are always looking for opportunities to break upfield at pace, but no chances have been forthcoming since two in the very early minutes here. Abelardo is watching on from the touchline and looks a little bit nervous, as that penalty has robbed the away side of the chance to try and nick an unlikely win on the counter-attack."
16',action,"Ronaldo is dropped very deep to get involved with the build-up play for the hosts, as Real Madrid continue to dominate possession and call the shots. Danilo is found by a ball down the right-hand side, but a failure to take a good first touch allows for Isma Lopez to get back goalside and defuse the situation."
14',action,"Over the top from Ronaldo! The Portuguese forward is picked out wonderfully by a corner delivery from the right-hand side, but nods shy of the target. He was entirely unmarked, but under no pressure the Real Madrid man couldn't convert from a few yards out. That should have been 2-0 to the hosts."
12',action,"Just wide from Rachid! The Algerian midfielder takes aim from long-range, and wins a corner for his side. Navas had to dive full-stretch to make sure that a deflected shot didn't creep inside his left-hand post. The resulting corner is swung in towards the back post, but nobody can make contact with the ball at all."
11',action,"Real Madrid are looking confident now, with Modric and Kovacic keen to see plenty of the ball. The latter, after all, has to prove that he can keep Casemiro out of the team. Danilo is fed on the overlap down the right-hand side, but a cross swung in by the Brazil international sails straight behind for a goal-kick. The ex-Porto man has had a poor start to proceedings in Madrid."
9',action,"Isma Lopez cuts back a great cross from the left-hand side, but Sporting are forced back towards their own goal. Rachid then goes on a weaving run towards the edge of the box, but the midfielder takes a poor touch and surrenders the opportunity to shoot from 20 yards out as a result."
7',action,"Real Madrid settle themselves down with a spell of possession, which ends in Ronaldo releasing Danilo down the right. A cut-back from the Brazilian is flicked on by James, but Sporting manage to clear their lines. Business as usual for the hosts now, after that brief scare from Cop and Carmona."

2',action,"Cop has the first half-chance of the game, after picking up a loose ball, but shoots a long way side of the left-hand post. Already, there are a few signs of frustration from the hosts, as Cristiano Ronaldo goes down heavily, before Nacho throws the ball away."

1',action,"Carmona should make it 1-0! The Sporting winger is fed into the penalty area by a wonderful pass, but with Navas approaching, the Spaniard can only stab a rushed effort wide of the near post.

James Rodriguez gets a rare start in place of the in-form Isco, with Lucas Vazquez deployed out on the right-hand side of the attack."
,action,"The hosts have, however, drawn two of their last four home games in the Spanish top-flight, which may give Sporting some hope. You'd have to look all the way back to January to find the last time that the visitors won away from El Molinon, and the man to grab the all-important goal in a 1-0 win against Valencia has since left the club. That man was Antonio Sanabria, with Duje Cop the main threat for Abelardo's men today."
