,action,"Thanks for joining our commentary this evening. Until next time, goodbye."
,action,"Eusebio Sacristan's men will feel hard done by this evening. They outplayed the visitors and were denied a perfectly good goal by the linesman as Juanmi saw his effort chalked off after Carlos Vela hit the bar. Vela later hit the post, which will leave the home side very aggrieved to be taking only a point from the contest."
,action,Barcelona will be delighted to have emerged from this game with a point as Real Sociedad were by far the better team at the Anoeta Stadium. Lionel Messi's strike earned them a point to take into El Clasico next week where they will try to close the gap on leaders Real Madrid.

87',action,"OVER! Vela tees up Granero for his first touch of the season and he opts to shoot from the edge of the box, sending his effort over the bar."

84',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Denis Suárez Fernández ; Vela is running the show at the moment and he gets brought down by Denis Suarez, resulting in a booking for the midfielder."
83',action,"VELA HITS THE POST! How are Sociedad not ahead in this game? Vela is allowed space and time once again on the edge of the box to pick his spot. He strikes the ball with power towards the bottom corner, but his effort strikes the woodwork and bounces wide. So unlucky for the home side."
81',action,"OFF THE LINE AND WIDE! Messi slides the ball into Denis Suarez's feet and he keeps his balance despite getting clipped. He rounds Rulli and strikes at goal, but Navas is there to clear it away. From the resulting corner Mascherano heads at goal, but the ball goes inches past the post, with Messi lurking at the back stick."
79',action,"Oyarzabal brings the ball away on the counter after Neymar is not given a free-kick. He feeds Yuri inside the box, who tries to pick out Vela at the back post, but misses both the net and his team-mate."
77',action,OH BOY! It's a shocker from the linesman on the replay. Juanmi was well onside when the ball was struck. The home fans inside the Anoeta are not happy with the official after seeing the replay on the big screen.
76',action,"OFF THE BAR AND DISALLOWED GOAL! Drama at the Anoeta as Vela finds space and time on the edge of the box to fire at goal.

70',action,"Roberto almost gets beat by Oyarzabal down the left flank, but the Spaniard recovers well to cut across the Sociedad forward, denying him access to the box."
68',action,"Better from the home side as they recycle possession in the final third before Carlos Martinez hits a good cross to the near post for Oyarzabal, but he just cannot get there in time and Pique clears the danger."
66',action,"Sociedad need to find their rhythm again. They were playing excellent football before Barca's equaliser, but Messi's strike has just knocked them out of sync."
64',action,"Vela tries to beat two Barcelona defenders on the right flank and one of those is Pique, who does well to win the ball, but also catches the Sociedad forward. However, the referee waves play on."
62',yellow-card,Yellow Card Carlos Martínez Díez ; Carlos Martinez takes out Suarez on the left and heads into the book.
61',action,"Willian Jose beats one challenge in the box and gets past Mascherano, but he just loses his footing at the vital moment as he was squaring to shoot. There were muted appeals for a penalty, but the contact appeared to be minimal from the Argentine."

59',goal,"Goal Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini ; GOAL!! Barcelona equalise out of nothing as Messi converts from close range. Neymar was the architect with a great run down the left.

58',action,Barcelona need a period of possession to slow this game otherwise they are in danger of falling further behind.
57',action,"Sociedad pressure the Barcelona backline and force a mistake from Sergi Roberto. Prieto tries to pick out Vela in the box, but Pique makes an important tackle at the back."
56',action,"OVER! From the resulting free-kick Inigo Martinez goes for goal, but he only send his effort well over the bar. It wasn't the best strike from the defender."
55',yellow-card,Yellow Card Javier Alejandro Mascherano ; Mascherano goes into the book as he brings down Vela 30 yards from goal.
53',goal,"Goal Willian José da Silva ; GOAL!!!!! SOCIEDAD TAKE THE LEAD! Willan Jose heads home from 12 yards as Barcelona collapse at the back. A simple ball over the top has the visitors in panic stations and Mascherano's slip allows Vela to pounce. Ter Stegen saves his effort, but Willian Jose pounces on the rebound and heads towards the goal. Pique is on the line, but he can only help the ball into the net."
52',action,"Oyarzabal hits the deck hard under Denis Suarez's challenge and requires treatment on the field, while Pique gets his boot strapped up."

,action,"The players are back out on the pitch, so we should be underway again shortly."
,action,"Eusebio Sacristan will be pleased with his side's performance, although they should be ahead as Carlos Vela and Xabi Prieto have both missed good chances in front of the net. They have dominated, but he will want to see his team take control and find the net in the second period."
,action,Barcelona survive at the break and head into the interval level with Real Sociedad despite the home side's dominance. Not only does Luis Enrique have his side's play to worry about he also has injury concerns over Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba. He faces an important 15 minutes in the dressing room.
