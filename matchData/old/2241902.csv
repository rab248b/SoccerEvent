,action,"And that will end a thriller at the KCOM Stadium, with Hull and Palace playing out a 3-3 draw. There's been late goals and great goals, but the home side will feel hard done by after controlling large spells of this match, only to be pegged back on the cusp of injury time. That's all from us, thanks for tuning in!"
90'+2',substitution,; Late change as Henriksen is brought on for Clucas.
90'+1',action,Do we even have time for any more drama? Crystal Palace are proving to be the Premier League's great entertainers this term. Twenty-seven goals scored and 29 conceded in 15 games this season.
89',assist,"Assist Wilfried Zaha ; Snodgrass will run him close, but Zaha is my pick for man of the match."
89',goal,"Goal Fraizer Campbell ; CAMBELL HAS TIED IT UP! That man Zaha has left his fingerprints all over a Palace goal again, as he whips in a fantastic cross onto the head of the substitute, who makes no mistake!"
88',action,"Puncheon opens up the space for a shot once again but after losing Clucas, he can't find the target with a wild effort that sails over the bar. The home fans are off their seats as the whistle draws nearer."
87',action,"Shades of Swansea here for Alan Pardew, where his side were in the lead heading into injury time, but ended up losing 5-4. You would be hard-pressed to deny Hull the three points here though - they've simply been the better team."
85',action,"Hull have started to settle down here in the closing stages, not taking as many risks by committing players forward. Palace have little over five minutes to recover something from this one."
82',action,"CLUCAS! The midfielder takes aim from the edge of the area but it swerves just wide! That would have surely wrapped it up. Hull are dominating, but you can't rule Palace out at all!"
80',substitution,; Kelly has been withdrawn for Frazier Campbell in an attacking change.
79',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Yohan Cabaye ; Cabaye gets booked for a high boot, but replays show no contact on Maguire."
78',assist,Assist Robert Snodgrass ; He has run the show tonight. What a game.
78',goal,"Goal Jake Livermore ; HULL ARE BACK IN FRONT! What an incredible game this is turning into! Livermore exchanges passes with Snodgrass to take Cabaye out of the equation, and he slots home from inside the area!"
77',action,"Hull charge forward again, with Snodgrass pulling the strings once more. He finds the run of Elmohamady overlapping on the right, and he squares for Diomande, but Martin Kelly blocks it!"
75',action,"Moments of magic at both ends of the pitch. Palace were in front for less than two minutes before Diomande struck, and the Hull fans raise the volume as their side chase a winner!"
72',assist,Assist Harry Maguire ; Maguire will be credited with the assist.
72',goal,"Goal Adama Valentin Diomande ; HULL ARE BACK IN BUSINESS! That didn't take long! Diomande, not to be outdone by Zaha, turns Dann inside out before finding a sure finish into the bottom corner. We're level at 2-2!"
71',substitution,; Cabaye has been introduced for McArthur.
70',goal,"Goal Wilfried Zaha ; FABULOUS FROM ZAHA! A corner was cleared to him at the corner of the box, and he appeared to have nowhere to go. However, he takes two defenders for a ride before hammering a tremendous finish into the roof of the net!"
69',action,"IMPORTANT SAVE FROM MARSHALL! Puncheon picks up the ball at the top of the box, and even he's surprised at the space that Dawson left him in. He tries to beat the keeper at his near post, but it's pushed away."
68',action,"Snodgrass plays a lovely ball forward for Robertson to chase, and the wing-back hooks a decent cross into the area that is still asking a little too much of Diomande and Elmohamady."
67',action,"Patient probing here from Hull City as they try to find an opening to score the go-ahead goal. Palace are doing absolutely nothing offensively, and are packed inside their own defensive third."
65',action,"Diomande again is in the thick of the action, attacking down the right-hand side and lashing a low shot down the throat of Hennessey. At the moment, Hull look like the more likely side to score again."
63',action,"Hull are starting to apply considerable pressure again, and Diomande gets the ball inside the area with a defender pinned to his back. He manages to create an inch of space on the turn, but fires wide."
61',action,"Livermore does superbly to battle away on the edge of the Palace penalty area, shrugging off a couple of challenges, only to see his attempted throughball to Diomande intercepted."
59',action,"Zaha goes down in the area again and is appealing for a penalty, but the referee is having none of it. He tried to go across Robertson inside the area and there was a bit of contact, but the ex-Man Utd man throe himself to the ground."
57',action,"Zaha is starting to become a real factor here. He's already changed the game by winning the penalty, and twists his way ito a good position on the left-hand side of the box, only to see his cross blocked."
54',action,"That goal came against the run of play, and we're back at all square. It's been a tale of two penalties, and that goal already looks like energising the visiting side to strike another blow."
52',penalty-goal,"Penalty Goal Christian Benteke Liolo ; BENTEKE ROLLS IT HOME! The striker notches his eighth goal of the Premier League season, applying a split-second of hesitation in his run up to commit Marshall, before slotting it calmly into the back of the net."
51',action,"PENALTY TO PALACE! Karma in some ways as Zaha turns Snodgrass inside the area, only to be brought down by the goalscorer. Having won a controversial one earlier, he's now given one away."
50',action,"Palace are unable to push out of their own defensive third, with Hull doing a great job of applying pressure from the front. They look very capable of grabbing a second goal here."
48',action,"Hull are dominating the ball to start the second half, in a marked improvement from the way they began the first. Robertson puts in a dangerous cross that's inches away from Diomande."
46',yellow-card,Yellow Card Jason Puncheon ; Puncheon commits a foul in a nothing area of the pitch and picks up a silly booking.
46',substitution,; Zeki Fryers has been brought on for Townsend.
46',action,Here we go again.
,action,"The referee brings matters to a temporary halt here at the KCOM Stadium, with a debatable penalty from Robert Snodgrass the difference between the teams. A slender advantage for the home side, but the points are anything but safe at this stage."
45'+1',yellow-card,"Yellow Card James McArthur ; James McArthur is the latest player to go into the book for dragging back Clucas. Of all the bookings that we've seen this afternoon, that one was probably the most clear-cut."
43',yellow-card,Yellow Card Ahmed Eissa El Mohamady Abdel Fattah ; Elmohamady looks bemused as he went into a challenge with Ledley and is booked. He felt that the Crystal Palace man gave just as much as he got in that incident.
41',action,"It's turning into an almighty midfield slog here, and Mike Jones is the busiest man on the pitch, having to keep a close eye on a couple of borderline challenges. Not long to go in the half now."
39',action,"Zaha and Townsend were at the heart of two good early openings for Palace, but since then, they've disappeared from the game. That type of inconsistency is perhaps, with the greatest respect, why they're now at Palace instead of Manchester United and Tottenham."
37',action,That earlier chance for Diomande was the type of service that the striker likes to receive - ball ahead of him with space to run into. Hull are trying to supply him in a similar manner by countering.
35',action,"Once again, the game has slowed down thanks to an influx of rough challenges in the centre of the park. The frustration is growing for the likes of Puncheon, who is one yellow card away from suspension."
32',action,"How do Palace respond to this setback? The keep attempting to drive through the midfield, but Hull are wise to that trap and are winning the ball back with ease, setting themselves up for some decent counters in the process."
29',action,"Hull have been in the ascendancy, and that goal is a much-needed boost for a side that have scored a league-low 11 times in 2016-17. Harsh on Palace, but they do have the quality to get back in this one."
27',penalty-goal,"Penalty Goal Robert Snodgrass ; SNODGRASS MAKES NO MISTAKE! The midfielder may have won a soft spot-kick, but there was nothing soft about his actual penalty. Smashed into the left-hand side, with Hennessey diving the wrong way."
26',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Scott Dann ; PENALTY TO HULL! Robertson sends a good ball into the area, with Snodgrass and Scott Dann both going for the ball. The defender tries to pull out of the challenge, and there appeared to be little contact, but the Hull man went down anyway. Yellow for Dann as well."
24',action,The Hull fans are sensing that their side are getting closer to their best as they begin to play the ball in dangerous positions. They're being helped by some careless turnovers from the visitors.
22',action,"Townsend sends a decent cross into Benteke, but the striker can't make contact on the ball. The big striker has scored seven goals in the league so far, a strong goal return for a side in the bottom half of the table."
20',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Robert Snodgrass ; Christian Benteke looks to have had Snodgrass beaten for pace as he strode through the middle, and he's bundled to the turf by the Hull No. 10. First booking of the game."
19',action,"Hull are growing into this game with every passing minute, and Robertson is inches offside as he stole in at the back post to attack the ball. Palace hare having no luck when they try to break."
17',action,"IMPORTANT STOP! The ball is sent over the top for Diomande, who split the centre-backs with his run. However, just as he pulled the trigger, out comes Hennessey to put him off and make some contact on the ball."
14',action,"A cynical challenge from Puncheon is spotted by the referee, and he's lucky that the yellow card stays sheathed again. Palace started well, but have allowed Hull to fight their way back."
12',action,"The match has entered a scrappy period with a series of fouls in midfield that has the referee running from player to player telling them to cut it out. Won't be long until we see a booking, one feels."
10',action,"Jason Puncheon drops his shoulder and gets by Tom Huddlestone, but the ex-Tottenham man bodies him to the turf, and gets a stern telling off from the referee, who keeps his cards in his pocket."
7',action,"Snodgrass is soon back with us as Hull attempt to launch their first attack of the game. Andrew Robertson runs into trouble however, as Joe Ledley isn't fooled by his attempts to slip by."
5',action,"Andros Townsend takes aim from the top of the box, but his shot is right down the throat of Wayne Hennessey. Moments later, Snodgrass is down after taking a blow in an aerial challenge."
3',action,"GOOD STOP! Wilfried Zaha shows a typical turn of pace to drive past his man down the right-hand side, and he lets loose with a low shot for the far corner that's denied by the fingertips of David Marshall."
1',action,Off we go!
,action,"Alan Pardew, taking control of his 300th Premier League game, has opted to stick with largely the same side that beat Southampton, with the only change coming as Martin Kelly replaces James Tomkins in defence."
,action,"For Hull, Tom Huddlestone and Harry Maguire are drafted into the starting lineup, with Ryan Mason and Markus Henriksen dropping out. Adama Diomande leads the line, with Robert Snodgrass slotting in just behind him."
,action,"Crystal Palace subs: Cabaye, Campbell, Phillips, Flamini, Lee, Speroni, Fryers."
,action,"Crystal Palace (4-2-3-1): Hennessey; Ward, Dann, Delaney, Kelly; McArthur, Ledley; Zaha, Puncheon, Townsend; Benteke."
,action,"Hull subs: Jakupovic, Mason, Weir, Maloney, Meyler, Henriksen, Bowen."
,action,"Hull  (3-5-2): Marshall; Davies, Dawson, Maguire; Elmohamady, Livermore, Huddlestone, Clucas, Robertson; Snodgrass, Diomande."
,action,Crystal Palace recorded a comfortable 3-0 win against Southampton that broke a six-game losing streak that had them plummeting down the table. Goals have not been a problem as they've scored 24 times - only the teams in the top four have managed more.
,action,"Hull haven't won in over a month, when they beat Southampton 2-1 at home in November. The Tigers are in 19th place, and have the unenviable distinction of holding both the worst attacking (11 scored) and defensive (29 conceded) record in the division simultaneously."
,action,Hello and welcome to our live commentary of the Premier League match between Hull and Crystal Palace. Only three points separate the sides in the table as the Tigers prepare for their final home game before Christmas.
