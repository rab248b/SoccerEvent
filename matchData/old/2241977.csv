,action,"That's all for our live coverage, thanks for following along. Goodbye!"
,action,"It's nothing less than they deserved in the end, completely dominating the match for the final hour, yet they went into the final minutes trailing as a result of Juan Mata's own goal. Perseverance and insistency pay off in the end, however, as the Red Devils get their equaliser in fairytale fashion."
,action,"Wayne Rooney makes history, becoming the Red Devils' all-time leading scorer in dramatic fashion, as his 94th minute goal rescues a point for United and extends their league unbeaten run to 13 games."
90'+5',action,FULL-TIME: STOKE CITY 1-1 MANCHESTER UNITED.
90'+4',goal,"Goal Wayne Rooney ; WHAT A TIME TO BREAK THE RECORD! Wayne Rooney becomes Manchester United's all-time leading scorer with an absolute gem of a free-kick, guiding the ball into the top corner from a difficult angle, but he made it look so easy! The Red Devils' most prolific scorer in club history has rescued them at the death!"
90'+3',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Joe Allen ; Allen concedes a free-kick on the edge of the box, to the left side of goal, with a foul on Rashford."
90'+2',action,"It's all looking a bit lethargic from United, who can't seem to find it in them to turn this around. As of right now, it looks ominous for the visitors, who can't navigate a way through this mess of Stoke defenders."
90',action,"The board goes up to indicate five minutes of stoppage-time, which is met by distinct groans from these Stoke City supporters."
88',substitution,"; A final change of the afternoon here for either side sees Stoke replace Arnautovic, who has been excellent, with Gianelli Imbula."
86',action,"STAT: Manchester United have only failed to score in one of their last 21 league games against Stoke, though it was in this exact fixture last season (0-2)."
84',action,"This is a terrific spell from Stoke to keep possession and weather the storm at the back. Much-needed respite here for the Potters in defence, as they are afforded the opportunity to catch their breath ahead of what promises to be a hectic final five minutes."
82',action,"Appeals for handball denied again by Clattenburg, before Stoke break quickly through Afellay. The Dutchman tries to play it across for Arnautovic, who would have put the game to bed likely, but the ball is deflected into the arms of De Gea, who immediately starts United back the other way."
80',action,"Into the final 10 minutes now and it's all hands on deck for Stoke, who have everyone back behind the ball. Their main focus is congesting the final third and making life difficult for United, and they're succeeding at the moment, as the visitors struggle to get a shot through the crowds of bodies."
78',action,"NOT FAR AWAY! Pogba this time tries his luck from 20 yards, hammering a low strike towards the near post, and has Grant scrambling, but again this effort misses by a mere foot."
77',action,"INCHES WIDE! Grant was beaten for the first time there, rooted to his spot as Rashford bent an effort towards the far corner, but flashed it agonisingly wide! United knocking on the door here!"
75',action,"STAT: Zlatan Ibrahimovic's 14 league goals have won Manchester United 11 points this season, no player has won more for this side (level with Diego Costa)."
73',substitution,"; Stoke make a change as well, their second, as Julien Ngoy replaces Shaqiri."
73',substitution,"; A bit surprising as Mkhitaryan is the one replaced for United, considering he's been arguably their most consistent attacker thus far. It's Jesse Lingard who replaces him."
71',action,"Concentrated pressure now, as it becomes a case of anywhere will do for Stoke. Both teams have changes lined up here it looks like, as they get set for the final 20 minutes."
69',action,"Urgency has been upped by United, who are running out of time. With Liverpool losing earlier today, and City set to face Spurs later, this is a big opportunity for the Red Devils, one they can ill-afford to squander."
67',substitution,"; On the verge of history, Wayne Rooney enters the match here with Juan Mata giving way, aiming to become Manchester United's all-time leading goal scorer."
66',action,"STAT: Jose Mourinho has lost two of his three Premier League visits to the Bet365 Stadium (W1), his joint-highest loss percentage at any Premier League ground (67%, level with the Riverside Stadium)."
64',action,"Shaqiri unloads a half-volley from 25 yards, making good contact with the hit, but De Gea is up to the task. It's shaping up to be a wonderful final 25 minutes at the Bet365!"
63',substitution,"; Stoke's first change sees Adam, who has grown increasingly frustrated, replaced by Ibrahim Afellay."
62',yellow-card,Yellow Card Erik Pieters ; Pieters becomes the third Stoke player booked on the afternoon.
60',action,"Appeals for handball and a penalty as the ball struck the arm of Pieters in the box. It ricocheted off his leg, however, and was not on it's way to goal by that point anyhow. There was little the full-back could do about it, but that was a strong passage of play from United nonetheless, with Pogba doing well to thread that ball through for Mata."
59',yellow-card,Yellow Card Lee Grant ; Lee Grant goes into the book for time wasting.
58',action,"CAN'T BEAT GRANT! The Stoke keeper has to be in the head of these United players by now. He makes another strong stop to deny Ibrahimovic, even though the offside flag again went up there. Still, the visitors have to be wondering what they have to do to get their goal."
56',substitution,"; Fellaini has been one of United's better players in this match, but his afternoon ends early here as he's replaced by Marcus Rashford."
54',action,"STAT: Manchester United have not gone four league games without a win at Stoke since a run of six in April 1964 – they are sitting at three, currently."
52',action,"NOT QUITE! Mata looks rather desperate to make amends for his errors. Fellaini does well to win a header in the area following Herrera's cross, sending it back across for Mata, who goes for the spectacular, but completely whiffs on his attempted overhead kick."
50',action,"Arnautovic, already on a yellow, is penalised for a handball in defence. That could have been worse for him, but he's certainly walking a tight line from this point forward. Mata delivers the ensuing free-kick, but his cross lacks quality and is cleared with ease."
48',action,"United open the second half in the ascendency, with Mkhitaryan looking particularly lively. The winger is commanding a lot of attention with the space he's getting into, which is leaving runners free elsewhere in attack."
46',action,Here we go again...
,action,"It took United a while to get going, but they ended the first half with a strong final 15 minutes, doing everything but score. There's still plenty more time here, with the match perfectly poised for the second half."
,action,"A comedy of errors from Juan Mata in the first half has Stoke ahead at the break at the Bet365. The Spaniard failed to track the run of Erik Pieters before turning his cross past De Gea for the Potters opener, before slicing his chance at redemption over the bar at the other end after a glorious set-up by Zlatan Ibrahimovic."
45',action,HALF-TIME: STOKE 1-0 UNITED.
43',action,"STUNNING TECHNIQUE! Exquisite timing there from Pogba on the volley, hammering an effort at goal from Blind's corner, but Grant reacts brilliantly to somehow get his hands up and keep it out! That had goal stamped all over it!"
42',action,"Blind's initial delivery is only partially cleared, before being played back into the danger area, and Fellaini's half-volley is turned over the bar admirably by Grant!"
41',action,"Adam sends Pogba toppling over on the edge of the box, after the ball had already gone, but it's enough for Clattenburg to award the visitors a free-kick, with no advantage to be played. It's right on the top-left corner, so not an ideal area for a shot, but definitely one to cross in here."
39',action,"OFFSIDE! The flag is up on Pogba, but it shouldn't take anything away from the save there from Grant to deny the Frenchman from point-blank range, after a clever ball over the top from Mata to play him through. United need to make this pressure pay off before half-time."
37',action,"United are definitely on top at the moment, looking a threat every time they get forward. This has been a strong response from them to falling behind, but they've had a nightmare in front of goal. Mkhitaryan is the latest one to miss, skying an effort from 15 yards, in all sorts of space in the centre."
35',action,"HAS TO BE BETTER! Ibrahimovic uncharacteristically indecisive in front of goal as he passes up a shot from eight yards, unnecessarily settling for a corner. The pressure stays on and Smalling is gifted a chance from a header, but he jumps a bit early and sends an effort well over the bar as a result!"
33',action,STAT: Only Ruud van Nistelrooy and Dwight Yorke (15 each) scored more goals in their first 20 Premier League games for United than Zlatan Ibrahimovic has managed (14).
31',action,"SHOCKING MISS! That's an absolutely brilliant ball from Ibrahimovic across to the far post, serving it up on a platter for Mata, who somehow slices it over the goal! He was under a bit of pressure from Martins Indi, but it was still a clean sight of goal. He absolutely HAS to be scoring there."
29',action,"Ibrahimovic does well to react to a deep cross to keep the ball in play and head it back towards the danger area, but Stoke are first to it, able to clear. The hosts have undoubtedly been the hungrier side thus far, and they have been rewarded accordingly."
27',action,"BETTER! This is more of a decent response from United to falling behind. Mata does well to whip in a cross, despite his momentum taking him away from goal, picking out Fellaini. The towering Belgian gets on the end of it, but needs to produce a much better effort than what he did to beat Grant, who saves without any panic."
25',action,"This is more like it from United, asserting themselves in the attacking half and working the ball around with a bit more urgency. This really is their first prolonged stay in attack, but it all comes to nothing as Blind sends a hopeful ball into the waiting arms of Grant."
23',action,"Arnautovic is awfully fired up at the moment, and he's just got to settle down a bit. He needs to be a bit more cautious, already on a yellow, not to give Clattenburg a decision to make. United have very little life about them, but a sending off for Arnautovic would certainly change the momentum."
21',action,STAT: Mark Hughes' next Premier League win at Stoke will be his 50th - only at Blackburn has he won more Premier League games as a manager (58).
19',own-goal,"Own Goal Juan Manuel Mata García ; STOKE SNATCH THE LEAD! Wonderful understanding out on the left between Pieters and Arnautovic! They work a give-and-go, with the full-back getting on the end of the move. Pieters tries to flash a low delivery across the face of goal, and Mata, who failed to track the run in the first place, diverts the ball into the back of his own net!"
17',action,"Much of the same here as the ball is being contained in midfield. United really look uninspired at the moment, struggling to keep the ball and posing absolutely no threat on Grant's goal."
15',action,"It just opens up for Stoke, if only for a moment, but Arnautovic guides them forward on a promising break. They aren't lacking support as the ball is carried into the final third, but Adam uncharacteristically wastes possession and just like that, the chance is gone."
13',action,"It's all sort of fizzled out to a halt at the Bet365 after a lively opening 10 minutes. It's become rather congested in midfield and the ball is being contained amongst the clutter, with neither side showing much ability to break through it."
11',action,"United are in the ascendency now, as Stoke are slowed after such a bright start to the match. The visitors are closing their gaps well and getting after the ball, which has really disrupted Stoke's rhythm in possession."
9',action,"STAT: Stoke are unbeaten in their last three home league games against Man Utd (W2 D1), after a run of five without a win against them (D1 L4)."
7',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Marko Arnautović ; Back the other way come United on the counter and Arnautovic is deemed to have tripped Mkhitaryan, with Mark Clattenburg setting a dangerous precedent as he shows him a yellow card for the foul. These fans are not happy, as they feel Smalling should have got one moments earlier."
5',action,"United are doing their best to just calm things down a bit here, in typical Jose Mourinho fashion. They need to weather this lively start from the Potters and get their footing under them. But in the meantime, Stoke have a free-kick as Smalling is penalised for a foul on the flank, about 40 yards from the byline."
3',action,"Stoke have started brightly and the Bet365 Stadium has responded accordingly, creating a terrific atmosphere to urge their Potters on. The interplay from the hosts in possession has been nothing if not nifty, as they pass their way through midfield with ease."
1',action,"AND THEY'RE OFF! Stoke in red and white as they get us underway, with Manchester United in blue."
,action,"Jose Mourinho has essentially a full-strength squad to chose from, with only Eric Bailly missing, and makes four changes from the draw with Liverpool. Chris Smalling and Daley Blind come into defence, while Marouane Fellaini earns a start in midfield and Juan Mata joins the attacking trident, replacing Marcos Rojo, Matteo Darmian, Michael Carrick and Anthony Martial."
,action,"Mark Hughes names an unchanged side to the one which won 3-1 at Sunderland last weekend. Bojan is available after missing last week's tilt through injury, but he's relegated to a spot on the bench, while Mame Diouf, Ramadan Sobhi and Wilfried Bony remain away at the African Cup of Nations."
,action,"SUBS: Rooney, Lingard, Carrick, Rashford, Romero, Schweinsteiger, Darmian."
,action,"MANCHESTER UNITED (4-3-3): De Gea; Valencia, Jones, Smalling, Blind; Fellaini, Herrera, Pogba; Mata, Mkhitaryan, Ibrahimovic."
,action,"SUBS: Bardsley, Muniesa, Afellay, Imbula, Given, Bojan, Ngoy."
,action,"STOKE (4-2-3-1): Grant; Johnson, Shawcross, Martins Indi, Pieters; Whelan, Adam; Shaqiri, Allen, Arnautovic; Crouch."
,action,CONFIRMED TEAM NEWS:
,action,"As a result, they now sit comfortably within striking distance of the Champions League places, four points behind fourth-place Arsenal, and just two behind rivals Manchester City in fifth, with 10 of their next 11 league games coming against teams below them in the table."
,action,"Manchester United’s current form could rival any other team in the country at the moment, though their nine-match winning run across all competitions came to an end following a 1-1 draw with Liverpool last weekend."
,action,Stoke have opened 2017 with back-to-back Premier League victories over Watford and Sunderland – though they were separated by a defeat to Wolves in the third round of the FA Cup – and now have successive home matches looming.
,action,"Mark Hughes appears to have the Potters back on course following an inexplicably poor first two months of the season. However, while they are back in the top half of the table, a further ascent seems unlikely given the gap between them and the top six."
,action,Hello and welcome to live coverage from Bet365 Stadium as Stoke City aim to maintain their perfect league form in 2017 when they host a Manchester United side closing in on the top four.
