,action,"Burnley were much improved from their abject performance against West Brom on Monday and will feel frustrated at having to leave without a point after putting in an impressive display. They caused plenty of problems for City in the middle of the pitch and largely defended well, but they were undone by two pieces of poor play when it mattered the most."
,action,"The referee blows his whistle for the final time and confirms that City will head to the top of the Premier League table - for now, at least. They weren't at their best this afternoon but nonetheless did enough after improving in the second half, and, once again, they relied on their star striker Aguero to get them out of trouble."
,action,FULL-TIME: BURNLEY 1-2 MANCHESTER CITY
90'+4',action,"Another great chance for Barnes! Burnley win themselves a late throw-in, and it's flung right on to the head of Tarkowski at the near post. The midfielder nods the ball over to Barnes and the striker immediately pulls off an overhead kick from close range, but, luckily for Bravo, the shot is sent straight into the hands of the Chilean."
90'+3',action,"Barnes goes close! Burnley keep pushing forward and win themselves a corner over on the right flank. Bravo tries to deal with Lowton's swinging cross but fails to catch it, allowing Barnes to get a header away from close range that looks set to find the back of the net but is just about dealt with by the wall of black shirts camped in front of goal."
90'+1',action,"Chance for Arfield! A deep cross causes problems for the City defence before a volleyed pass is played over to Arfield, but the midfielder is unable to make contact with his audacious overhead kick and the visitors manage to survive once again."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be four minutes of added time.
89',substitution,"Substitution Sergio Leonel Agüero del Castillo Jesús Navas González .City have made their final substitution of the game, with Aguero making way for Navas."
88',action,"Burnley keep putting pressure on City as they desperately try to find a late equaliser. They do well to win themselves a throw-in over on the right flank before Lowton swings a cross towards Vokes, but it's overhit and fails to find the Welshman in front of goal."
86',action,"Aguero gives away a free-kick just inside the Burnley half of the pitch and allows Robinson to thump the ball forward. It's only half dealt with by City and falls into the feet of Boyd, but his thumping low strike from the edge of the penalty area fails to beat the sea of black shirts camped in front of him."
84',action,"Vital block by Mee! Sagna cuts inside from the right flank and tees up Aguero in a good position on the edge of the penalty area. The Argentine meets the ball well before trying to tee up Sane, but Mee is there to cut out the danger at the vital moment."
82',action,"Tarkowski breaks down the left wing on a marauding run before teeing up Boyd, who immediately puts pressure on Otamendi and forces him into poking the ball out for a corner. It fails to result in a chance on goal for Burnley, however, and City break forward once again."
80',substitution,"Substitution Steven Defour Ashley Barnes .Burnley have made their final change, and it's an attacking one, with Barnes coming on to replace Defour as they switch to a 4-4-2 formation for the last 10 minutes."
79',action,"City move the ball around nicely deep inside the Burnley half of the pitch as they try to carve out a chance on goal, but Sane ends up bringing a promising attacking move to a disappointing end with a mishit 25-yard strike that sails well wide of the goal."
78',substitution,"Substitution Manuel Agudo Durán Kevin De Bruyne .City have made their second alteration of the afternoon, with Nolito making way for De Bruyne."
77',action,"Hendrick goes close! Defour wins Burnley a corner, which is then whipped into the heart of the penalty area. Once again, it finds Keane and the defender nods the ball over to Hendrick at the far post, but the Irishman is in an offside position and the linesman's flag is raised quickly."
76',action,"Vital block by Kolarov! Another lovely cross causes problems for City and this time finds Tarkowski at the far post. He meets the ball well before nodding it back to Keane, but the latter's second attempt on goal in as many minutes is blocked by Kolarov after beating Bravo."
74',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Manuel Agudo Durán.Nolito barges into Mee and gives away a free-kick just inside the Burnley half of the pitch, and he then becomes the latest player to receive a booking after reacting angrily to the decision."
73',action,"Burnley quickly win the ball back and continue coming back at City with two dangerous crosses into the penalty area. The first is dealt with by the visitors before the second finds Keane, but the defender is unable to beat Bravo with his headed effort."
72',action,"A clumsy challenge by Otamendi leaves the referee with no choice but to award Burnley a free-kick just outside of the City penalty area. It's chipped in by Defour and sails over to the far post, but it's easily caught by Bravo under very little pressure."
70',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Sergio Leonel Agüero del Castillo.Once again, Aguero breaks through the Burnley defence and latches on to a well-timed pass forward, this time from Toure, but he's flagged offside as soon as he makes contact with the ball and then earns himself a yellow card for kicking the ball into the back of the net in frustration."
69',action,"A Burnley attack breaks down and City immediately fly forward through Sane. The substitute plays a quick one-two with Fernandinho before teeing up Aguero, who then pokes a lovely pass into the box and back towards the German, but Keane darts across the penalty area to beat the youngster to the ball."
67',action,"The corner is sent short and quickly worked over to Sagna just outside of the penalty area, but his audacious effort from 25 yards out fails to trouble Robinson and instead deflects away from danger and towards the halfway line."
66',yellow-card,Yellow Card Matthew Lowton.Lowton clattered into Otamendi in the build-up to City's last attacking move and is eventually shown a yellow card when the ball bounces out of play.
66',action,"Sane and Aguero link up well on the right-hand side of the Burnley box before the latter gets a shot away, but it's closed down by Tarkowski and ends up being deflected out to Sagna, who then wins the visitors a corner."
64',action,"Aguero bursts through the Burnley back line and does well to latch on to a curling pass forward from Clichy, but his run is slightly mistimed and the linesman's flag is raised as soon as he makes contact with the ball inside the penalty area."
62',action,"Fernandinho drags Tarkowski to the ground and Burnley are awarded a free-kick in a good position midway inside the City half of the pitch. The set-piece is thumped forward before an attempted clearance ends up dropping to Hendrick, who then fires a thumping volley off a black shirt and out for a corner."
60',assist,"Assist Fernando Luiz Rosa.Fernandinho did well to take advantage of clumsy defending to tee up Aguero, but, once again, Burnley shot themselves in the foot with indecision at the worst possible moment."
60',goal,"Goal Sergio Leonel Agüero del Castillo.GOAL! City have taken the lead! The ball pinballs around the Burnley penalty area as the home side desperately try to clear the ball. They're unable to do so, however, and Ward eventually trips over Tarkowski in comedic fashion before Fernandinho sets up Aguero to poke the ball into the back of the net from close range once again."
59',action,"Burnley are doing really well to press City in the middle of the pitch, which is frustrating the visitors' rhythm. City have looked slightly better since the break but are still struggling to do much inside the final third of the pitch."
57',substitution,"Substitution Raheem Shaquille Sterling Leroy Sané .City have made their first substitution of the game, with Sterling, who was just wiped out by a crunching challenge from Mee, making way for Sane."
56',action,"Poor from Defour! The Belgian charges down the right wing on a great run before skipping past Kolarov and firing a cross into the middle of the penalty area, but it's sent slightly behind Hendrick and fails to find the Irish midfielder in front of goal."
55',action,"Fernandinho muscles his way towards the edge of the Burnley box as City come back once again on a determined attacking move. He knocks a clever pass into the path of Sterling, who then tries to whip a cross over to Aguero, but the winger is closed down by Tarkowski and ends up poking the ball out for a goal-kick."
53',action,"Sterling takes on Ward once again down the right flank, but the midfielder comes out on top and deflects the ball out for a corner. Sterling steps up and tries to whip a low cross towards a black shirt, but, again, his ball into the box is poor and fails to cause problems for the home side."
51',action,"Toure links up well with Nolito and muscles his way past Tarkowski before firing a thumping strike from the edge of the Burnley penalty area, but there's slightly too much power behind the effort and it ends up flying several yards over the top of the crossbar."
49',action,"City win themselves a free-kick over on the right flank, and Sterling whips in a low cross that is unable to beat the first man. The ball then loops out to Fernando, but the Brazilian's long-range effort is poor and sails comfortably wide of the Burnley goal."
47',action,"Sterling quickly cuts inside from the right flank and does well to tee up Aguero, but the Argentine is unable to double his goalscoring tally and sees his low strike deflected away from danger by the outstretched foot of Mee."
46',action,And we're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"It's been an impressive opening 45 minutes from Burnley, who have arguably been the better of the two sides and should really be heading into the half-time break a goal ahead. Marney's wonderful volley fired them into the lead in fine fashion, and since then they have done well to frustrate the City front line. Aguero finally found a way through the hosts' defence after the Clarets failed to deal with a corner, but, either side of that, Guardiola's men have looked sluggish and flat inside the final third of the pitch."
,action,HALF-TIME: BURNLEY 1-1 MANCHESTER CITY
45'+4',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Nicolás Hernán Otamendi.Otamendi clumsily handles the ball midway down the right wing and gives away a free-kick before earning himself a yellow card. Defour steps up and fires a cross towards the edge of the City box, but the visitors are able to deal with the danger before the referee brings an end to the first half."
45'+3',action,"And now Vokes goes close! Arfield takes on Clichy before spinning and finding Lowton in a pocket of space. The full-back immediately swings an excellent curling cross that flies right on to the head of Vokes, but the striker is unable to beat Bravo with his downward header at the near post."
45'+1',action,"Great chance for Sterling! Aguero cuts inside from the right wing and penetrates the penalty area before cutting the ball back to Sterling, but the latter's attempted strike from close range is quickly closed down by Keane and fails to cause any problems for Robinson."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be four minutes of added time.
43',substitution,Substitution Johann Berg Guðmunds­son James Tarkowski .Gudmundsson will play no further part in the game and is replaced by Tarkowski. It looks as if he's going to operate as a central midfielder.
42',action,"There are more problems for Burnley, as now Gudmundsson seems to be struggling with an injury. It looks like he's tweaked his hamstring taking on Clichy, and, like Marney, he too may have to make way."
41',action,"Gudmundsson spins past Clichy far too easily over on the right wing and powers down the right flank on a great run. He spots a good run forward from Vokes and tries to pick out the striker with a low cross, but Fernando does well to get back and cut out the danger on the edge of the penalty area."
40',substitution,"Substitution Dean Marney Scott Arfield .Marney, who has been struggling with an injury over the past 10 minutes, drops to the ground once again and is eventually forced into being replaced by Arfield."
39',action,"Aguero almost scores again! The Argentine cuts on to his left foot and quickly unleashes a beautiful curling shot that looks set to find the top left-hand corner of the net, but Robinson is there to parry the effort out for a corner with a wonderful diving save."
37',assist,"Assist Nicolás Hernán Otamendi.It's difficult to know how much Otamendi knew about the ball that came hurtling towards him, but Burnley will certainly feel frustrated that they were undone by a set-piece that should have been dealt with."
37',goal,"Goal Sergio Leonel Agüero del Castillo.GOAL! City have equalised! The corner is fired into the middle of the penalty area, where it deflects off Vokes and over to Otamendi. The defender sticks out a foot and knocks the ball over to the far post, where Aguero pounces on it and beats Robinson with a close-range strike."
36',action,"Great tackle by Lowton! Sterling flies into the right-hand side of the Burnley penalty area before holding up the ball and waiting for a teammate. He decides not to shoot and instead tees up Nolito on the penalty spot, but the Spaniard is closed down by Lowton and has to settle for a corner."
35',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Dean Marney.Toure hits the post! Fernandinho charges forward before being scythed to the ground by Marney, who receives the first yellow card of the game as a result. The free-kick is taken short and worked towards Toure on the edge of the penalty area, and the Ivorian then unleashes a rocket of a strike that beats Robinson before hitting the outside of the near post."
34',action,"Dangerous cross by Gudmundsson! The Icelander steps up and curls an excelent cross right under the crossbar. Bravo is put under pressure by Ward and fails to reach the ball, but, luckily for him, no Burnley player is able to make contact with it either."
33',action,"Sterling drags Ward to the ground over on the left flank midway inside the City half of the pitch, and once again Burnley are presented with a chance to whip the ball into the penalty area. It's fired in by Defour and finds Keane, who then sends a header off Kolarov and out for a corner."
31',action,"Sterling cuts inside from the right wing and tees up Aguero, who is in a good position on the edge of the Burnley box. He's slightly off-balance when he receives the ball, however, and ends up firing his volleyed strike comfortably wide of the goal."
30',action,"City string together a series of good passes before Sterling takes on Defour deep down the right wing, but the Belgian comes out on top and denies the Englishman a way through. He then kick-starts a counter-attack with a cross-field pass over to Gudmundsson, who quickly knocks the ball up to Hendrick, but the latter is unable to find a way past Fernando."
28',action,"Aguero breaks into the left-hand side of the Burnley box and tries to shoot, but he's closed down by Lowton and has to settle for a corner. The set-piece isn't dealt with by the hosts and falls nicely for Toure near to the penalty spot, but he ends up tangling with Clichy and loses his footing at the vital moment."
27',action,"Nolito does well to muscle his way towards the Burnley penalty area before teeing up Sterling, who had made a great run into the box, but as soon as the winger makes contact with the ball, he's dispossessed by an excellent tackle from Mee."
26',action,"Burnley keep coming back at City and put the visitors' back four under pressure with a dangerous cross into the middle of the box. The ball pinballs around as a plethora of players desperately try to get it under control, but it's Sagna who eventually does before volleying a clearance up towards the halfway line."
25',action,"Burnley win themselves a free-kick on the halfway line, and it's thumped up towards the edge of the City penalty area. The ball is nodded down to Boyd, who does well to out-muscle Sagna and poke a pass towards Vokes, but Otamendi is there to thump a clearance out for a throw-in."
23',action,"Sterling flies down the right wing and cuts inside before teeing up Toure on the edge of the penalty area. The Ivorian is in a good position and looks set to move the ball over to Aguero, but his first touch is poor and sends the ball rolling into the hands of Robinson."
22',action,"Hendrick breaks towards the City box and knocks the ball over to Boyd, who quickly wins Burnley another corner on the left wing. Gudmundsson steps up and sends an out-swinging cross into the heart of the penalty area, but City are just about able to deal with the danger."
20',action,"Another great save by Robinson! Toure cuts inside from the left flank on a determined run before teeing up Nolito just inside the penalty area, but the Spaniard's low strike is well saved by the goalkeeper, who quickly gets down low to his left."
19',action,"The ball pinballs around the edge of the Burnley penalty area as both Aguero and Toure try to get shots away. The Argentine's deflects off the ankle of Keane before rolling out to the Ivorian, but he's closed down quickly and is unable to test Robinson with his curling effort."
18',action,"City are continuing to boss possession in the middle of the pitch, but they're failing to do much with it. Burnley are doing really well to put plenty of pressure on the visitors' midfielders, which is making life incredibly tough for Guardiola's men."
16',action,"City immediately push forward on a dangerous and quick attacking move down the right flank before Sterling does well to penetrate the Burnley box, but Ward darts across and deals with the winger thanks to a well-timed tackle that results in a corner for the visitors."
14',goal,"Goal Dean Marney.GOAL! What a strike by Marney! Robinson thumps a free-kick up towards the edge of the City penalty area, where a group of Burnley players are waiting. Otamendi meets the ball first but can only head it down to Marney, who immediately unleashes a rocket of a volley that flies past Bravo and into the bottom left-hand corner of the net."
13',action,"Opportunity for Gudmundsson! Lowton rises high and beats his marker on the halfway line before nodding the ball down to Gudmundsson. The Icelander quickly cuts inside from the right wing and skips past Fernando before firing a low strike towards the bottom right-hand corner of the net, but Bravo is there to stop the effort from finding the back of the net."
12',action,"Hendrick and Marney battle with Fernando for the ball in the middle of the pitch before the latter comes out on top and sends a bouncing pass down the right flank, but Gudmundsson is unable to latch on to it and Clichy does well to sheperd the pass out for a throw-in."
10',action,"Burnley work the ball around nicely before winning themselves a corner over on the left flank. It's fired into a dangerous position in the middle of the penalty area and initially causes City a few problems, but they do well to deal with the danger before trying to kick-start a counter-attack."
8',action,"Early chance for Aguero! The Argentine weaves forward on a lovely run before testing Robinson with a low strike from 25 yards out, but the veteran goalkeeper gets down well to tip the effort round the near post and out for a corner, which is also easily dealt with by the 37-year-old."
7',action,"Hendrick goes down inside the box, but nothing is given! Boyd is clumsily challenged by Fernandinho and wins Burnley a free-kick in an advantageous position. It's lifted into the middle of the penalty area, where it finds Hendrick, but he immediately goes down under a challenge from Otamendi after receiving the ball. Both he and Vokes scream for a penalty, but the referee isn't at all interested and waves play on."
6',action,"City lose the ball in the middle of the pitch and Boyd immediately breaks forward on a quick counter-attack. He gets himself into a good position before teeing up Defour, who then fires a low, first-time cross into the heart of the penalty area, but Fernando is there to cut out the danger before the ball can find Vokes."
5',action,"City continue to dominate possession before Kolarov thumps another long pass forward, this time over to Sagna on the right flank, but, once again, it's poorly executed by the Serbian and can only find Boyd on the halfway line."
4',action,"Sterling is knocked to the ground just inside the Burnley half of the pitch, resulting in a free-kick for City that take quickly and send short. They work the ball around patiently before Kolarov fires a lofted pass towards Aguero, but it's poorly hit and is easily cut out by Keane."
2',action,"A lovely cross-field pass from Fernandinho finds Nolito in a good position deep down the left flank. The Spaniard cuts inside and heads towards the edge of the penalty area before trying to tee up Aguero, but Mee is able to get a head on the ball. His clearance is only as far as Fernando, however, and the Brazilian immediately tees up Toure to his right, but, off balance, the latter fires his attempted effort on goal well wide of its intended target."
1',action,"And we're off! City get us underway, attacking from right to left."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."
,action,"Meanwhile, City boss Pep Guardiola has made five alterations to the team that featured in the draw against Gladbach during the week, with John Stones, Jesus Navas, David Silva, Ilkay Gundogan and Kevin De Bruyne making way for Bacary Sagna, Gael Clichy, Fernando, Yaya Toure and Nolito, respectively."
,action,"Sean Dyche has decided to make two changes to the Burnley side that started the 4-0 defeat away to West Brom on Monday, with the most notable inclusion being 37-year-old Paul Robinson, who replaces the injured Tom Heaton to make his first Premier League appearance in over four years. Meanwhile, George Boyd has been preferred to Scott Arfield on the left wing."
,action,"Manchester City substitutes: Caballero, Zabaleta, Sane, Navas, Silva, De Bruyne, Iheanacho."
,action,"Manchester City XI (4-2-3-1): Bravo; Sagna, Otamendi, Kolarov, Clichy; Fernandinho, Fernando; Sterling, Toure, Nolito; Aguero."
,action,"Burnley substitutes: Pope, Flanagan, Tarkowski, Kightly, Arfield, Gray, Barnes."
,action,"Burnley XI (4-4-1-1): Robinson; Lowton, Keane, Mee, Ward; Gudmundsson, Marney, Defour, Boyd; Hendrick; Vokes."
,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"Burnley started the day with no new injury concerns but will be without goalkeeper Tom Heaton after he pulled out at the last minute with a calf injury. Meanwhile, Sergio Aguero, who was a doubt in the build-up, has passed a late fitness test and will lead the City line once again. The Clarets picked up a shock victory in the last meeting between the two teams back in March 2015, but City have dominated this fixture in recent years, winning four of the previous six contests."
,action,"Today’s clash is a completely different prospect, however, as they must face a City side that find themselves just one point behind current league leaders Chelsea. Pep Guardiola’s men have lost only one Premier League game thus far, and they head to Burnley with their spot in the last-16 of the Champions League secure thanks to Wednesday’s 1-1 draw away to Borussia Monchengladbach."
,action,"Burnley have struggled on their travels, picking up just one point from a possible 15, but at home they have looked a far more formidable force. All four of their league wins have come at Turf Moor, with only Swansea City and Arsenal managing to get the better of them, and by solitary goals on both occasions."
,action,"All in all, it’s not been a bad start to the season for Burnley, who currently sit in a respectable 12th place in the table thanks to a decent opening 12 games in which they have already beaten the likes of Liverpool and Everton. However, last weekend proved to be a miserable one for the Clarets, who were mercilessly thumped 4-0 by West Bromwich Albion on a tough night at the Hawthorns."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Premier League game between Burnley and Manchester City at Turf Moor.
