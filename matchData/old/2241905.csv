,action,"Full-time at Old Trafford as the stadium erupts in cheers. Manchester United close the gap between themselves and Tottenham in the table by securing a narrow 1-0 win against the London side, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan grabbing the only goal of the game in the first half. Things looked nervous for the Red Devils in the latter stages, but Mourinho's men hold out for a vital three points. Thanks for joining us, see you next time."
90'+6',substitution,; Herrera makes way for Fellaini.
90'+5',action,"Rose, who is being booed every time he touches the ball due to his part played in the Mkhitaryan injury, drives down the left wing with pace before smashing a cross into the box, but Valencia is positioned well to turn behind for a corner-kick."
90'+3',action,"Kane attempts to latch on to a deep cross to the back post but even though it is very gettable, the England striker can't stretch out a leg to take the touch in to feet. This kind of sums up his day, which as been underwhelming to say the least."
90'+1',action,"A generous SIX minutes of added time have been allocated by the referee and this will certainly provide Spurs with one last boost on confidence before the final whistle. They need to start creating chances though, particularly through Kane, as De Gea has been pretty comfortable for the most part."
89',action,"Spurs have United camped inside their own penalty box at the moment with a bit of sustained possession. All the play is going down the right wing Sissoko and Walker linking up well, but all the threat comes swiftly out of their attack as the latter sends a cross straight out of play for a goal-kick."
87',action,"The home side are doing well just to professionally run down the clock here, with a few free-kicks being cheaply given away by Spurs in and around their penalty box. Pogba has been superb in the past five minutes, continually displaying great strength to keep the ball up the opposite side of the pitch."
85',substitution,"; Unfortunately for United, Mkhitaryan has not managed to recover from that Rose challenge in which he appeared to go over on his ankle. He leaves the pitch on a stretcher and will be replaced by Eric Bailly, so some defensive reshuffling required from Mourinho it would seem as we approach the last five minutes."
83',substitution,"; Last throw of the dice from Pochettino as he makes his third and final change. Leaving the action is Eriksen and he will be replaced by Georges-Kevin N'Koudou, who certainly has some pace to burn going forward. Lets see if he can make an impact for Spurs."
82',yellow-card,Yellow Card Danny Rose ; A yellow for Rose as Mkhitaryan goes down with what looks like an ankle injury. The Manchester United man may have to go off here.
80',action,"The United fans don't paint themselves in a good light here as a small minority begin to jeer and boo as Fellaini makes his way from the dugout to warm up. Yes, the Belgian cost them three points against Everton last week, but it can't be nice receiving abuse from your own fans."
79',action,"Walker sees yellow now, this time for pulling the shirt of Rashford."
78',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Kyle Walker ; Another booking for United here, who are picking up quite a number of fouls to try and thwart any potential Tottenham counters. Mkhitaryan is the latest player to see yellow for a cynical tackle on Winks. Spurs free-kick."
77',action,"Pogba displays some dazzling touches in front of Wanyama before popping a pass out wide to Rashford. The substitute gains a yard on Walker before firing a teasing cross into the box, but even with Ibrahimovic barging through, Vertonghen defends superbly to head out of the box."
74',action,"It will be interesting to see how United, and Mourinho, approach the last portion of play as they have developed a very habit habit of conceding late goals when they have more or less dominated proceedings. This happened last week against Everton, so the wounds will still be fresh. No sign of Fellaini, though..."
72',substitution,"; First substitution from Mourinho and it is basically like-for-like down this left-hand side. Leaving the action is Martial and his replacement wil be Marcus Rashford, who will be tasked with helping out Darmian up against Sissoko as well as providing electric pace on the counter."
71',action,"Sissoko moves into the final third unopposed and lashes a pass into the feet of Kane, who very cleverly uses his body to earn the free-kick out of Rojo in a cracking position. Eriksen is once again charged with the set-piece, but fails to outwit De Gea as the Spaniard palms away at his near post."
69',action,"Ibrahimovic picks up the ball in an advanced area, which has bee a rarity in the past 10 minutes or so. Mkhitaryan is completely free on the opposite flank but the former Sweden international is drowned out among three of four Spurs shirts, meaning he just can't get the pass away to his unmarked team-mate. Spurs attack."
67',substitution,"; Another change from Pochettino now as he looks to change the balance of play. Entering the action is young midfielder, Harry Winks, and he will replace Dembele in the middle of the park up against Carrick and Herrera."
65',yellow-card,Yellow Card Paul Pogba ; Pogba sees yellow for a cynical tackle on Dembele to halt a Spurs counter.
64',action,"ANOTHER GREAT SAVE FROM LLORIS! Herrera finds himself in plenty of space down the right wing with Rose posted missing. He picks out a low, bouncing pass to the feet of Pogba who slams a strike ominously towards the corner, but the Spurs goalkeeper stands tall once again to deny the Red Devils!"
62',action,"UNITED HIT THE WOODWORK! After a foul from Dembele, Pogba stands over the set-piece from 30 yards and then steps up to fire an absolutely magical strike up and over the wall towards the top corner. It looks in all the way but with Lloris rooted to the spot, the attempt crashes off the inside of the post!"
60',action,"It has been a decent cameo from Sissoko so far as the Frenchman has already collected the ball twice down the right-hand side to bully Darmian, and then Pogba of all people, out of the way. Certainly promising from Spurs, but the deliveries could have been a bit better from the substitute."
58',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Victor Wanyama ; The referee goes into his pocket again, this time for Spurs. Wanyama is the guilty party as he just leaves a wayward arm in the face of Jones after the Manchester United defender had initially did very well to bravely clear from a corner-kick."
57',substitution,"; First change of the match and it comes from Pochettino. Leaving the pitch is Son and his replacement down the right-hand side will be Moussa Sissoko, who is yet to see his Tottenham career take off after that pricey move from Newcastle. Good time to make an impact."
56',action,"A fairly scrappy opening to the second period so far, but Spurs can probably take heart from their showing since the break. They need Kane to get on the end of one of these chances that are falling to the likes of Eriksen and Wanyama, though."
54',action,"OH WHAT A SITTER FROM WANYAMA! The former Celtic man, who has posed big threat from set-pieces the whole match, actually gets on the end of one this time as he rises high at the back post, but it seems like he isn't actually ready for it as the ball cannons off the side of his head wide of the target! It really should be all-square!"
52',action,"Spurs catch United out with a speedy counterattack which is lead forward by Alli on the left wing. He finds Walker, who very cleverly flicks into the path of Eriksen, but the subsequent shot on goal from the Dane, although well-struck, goes straight down the throat of De Gea between the sticks."
50',action,"Walker takes a quick throw-in to the feet of Kane who takes the ball in with his back to goal. The Englishman holds off the challenge of Rojo to find Eriksen, who in turn passed back to Wanyama, but all the threat is taken out of the attack for Spurs as United get back into a sturdy defensive shape pretty quickly."
48',action,"Pogba glides down the right channel and slips a precision pass into space for Ibrahimovic to move on to, but Rose shows off his considerable pace to get there before the former PSG striker, who is no spring chicken in the pace department. Good defending in the end."
46',action,We are back under way at Old Trafford!
,action,"Half-time at Old Trafford. United are on course for a much-needed win at home as they lead Spurs at the break after a superb finish from Mkhitaryan. Still plenty of football to be played, though, and the visitors are by no means out of this, having managed to test De Gea a few times. Second period to come."
45',action,"One minute of added time has been allocated by the referee which sounds about right as the game has pretty much been free-flowing. United are on the attack, but there probably won't be enough time to generate a chance before the players head for the break."
43',action,"Wanyama has been involved in the thick of things within the past few minutes, and the recent incidents must be making him quite frustrated. Initially, Rojo is pulling his shirt only for a penalty not to be awarded, then he is penalised for simply showing a bit up strength up against Pogba."
41',action,"Alli attempts to latch on to a loose ball down the right wing and does really well to reach it just before the byline which enables him to win the corner out of Darmian. Eriksen takes the resulting set-piece, but Rojo, whilst under plenty of pressure from Wanyama, manages to clear behind for another. It looked like there was some pushing and pulling going on there."
39',action,"Pogba has been dealt with fairly comfortably by Wanyama in particular in this first half, but the Frenchman manages to break free from the attentions of his marker on this occasion to burst forward through the middle into the final third. He flashes a pass in to the feet of Ibrahimovic who goes for the return pass, but it is a miscommunication from the United duo which allows Spurs to clear in the end."
37',action,"Much, much better from Tottenham now as they finally increase the tempo of their attacking play. They are certainly being more positive in throwing men forward as Alderweireld actually finds himself in a great position to the right of the penalty area, but the shot from the Belgium international is bravely blocked by Rojo at the front post."
35',action,"Son attempts to claw Spurs back into contention here as he picks up possession a few yards in from the right touchline before cutting inside on his left foot this time. He pulls the trigger with a cracking left-footed attempt, but De Gea remains tall between the sticks to palm over the crossbar."
33',action,"ANOTHER SAVE FROM LLORIS! United are looking very dangerous at the moment and create another good chance as Ibrahimovic picks up a deep cross to the back post. The Swede takes the touch before firing a strike low towards the corner, but it lacks a bit of pace which makes it more comfortable for Lloris to get down and make the block."
31',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Luis Antonio Valencia Mosquera ; First yellow card of the match now and it a deserved one for Valencia who nastily scythes through Rose in the middle of the United half. There was no need for such a challenge, and the Ecuadorian rightfully sees his name go into the book."
29',assist,Assist Ander Herrera Agüera ; Great work from Herrerra as he wins the ball and then picks out his team-mate for the assist.
29',goal,Goal Henrikh Mkhitaryan ; GOOOOOAAAAALLLLLL FOR MANCHESTER UNITED! The hosts open the scoring! Kane poorly gives the ball away in the middle of the park and it is Herrerra who pounces to win possession before threading a lovely pass through the middle. Mkhitaryan takes in to feet before running forward and smashing a strike into the roof of the net from 18 yards! Brilliant! One-nil.
28',action,"Martial and Darmian link up well near the corner flag this time and it is the latter who eventually gains a yard of space before firing a cross to the front post. Mkhitaryan gets ahead of his marker but the ball has plenty of pace on it, which makes it a bit easier for Lloris to pounce on the poor touch."
26',action,"The Tottenham defence is under the cosh at the moment and is being forced to clear plenty of balls into the box. The latest loose bit of possession meets Carrick, who drills a superb strike on goal from around 30 yards out, but United are forced to settle for the corner-kick as it takes a nick off Wanyama before going behind."
24',action,"Ibrahimovic comes deep to see a bit more of the ball this time and takes in with an assured touch before lifting an outstanding pass deep down the flank for Martial, who now has plenty of space to run into. However, a poor first touch from the former Monaco man gives Walker the chance to just step in and make the tackle inside the box."
22',action,"VITAL block from the Spurs defence! Martial picks up the ball down the left channel but is forced back after some good defensive work from Eriksen. Eventually, the hosts smuggle possession to Mkhitaryan on the edge of the area with the Armenian then sending a cracking shot down towards the bottom corner. It looks like Rose who gets in the way, importantly."
20',action,"The slightly worrying thing for both sides so far is that both star strikers, Ibrahimovic and Kane, are yet to get into the game to a particularly high degree. A testament to both defences, perhaps, but the creative players from midfield need to provide more service, too."
18',action,"Moments after the previous free-kick, Spurs are awarded another in basically the same position. Eriksen opts to go for goal this time and fires a strike up and down over the United wall, but De Gea is on his toes enough to dive across goal and scramble a save away to the right-hand side. Not the best organisation from the home side there."
16',action,"Wanyama uses his considerable strength to bulldoze his way through the middle of the park, eventually earning a free-kick out of Pogba. Eriksen is tasked with the set-piece and it is actually the Kenyan who is the target of the cross to the back post, but Valencia manages to clear, albeit a bit fortuitously."
14',action,"Eriksen pops up down the right wing this time and skips past the challenge of Darmian before firing an early cross deep towards the opposite flank. Son bursts a gut to try and get on the end of it, but even he is unable to keep the ball in play and United are let-off with the throw-in. Disappointing in the end from the visitors."
12',action,"A little bit of a lull in proceedings at the moment after that fairly promising opening. Spurs are, of course, one of the best sides in the Premier League at setting up defensively so it was never going to be easy for United to break them down, especially considering this has actually been a worry for Mourinho's men in other matches."
10',action,"For the first time in the match, Martial gets the opportunity to run into space down this left wing after Walker is caught pretty high up the pitch. The Frenchman eats up the pitch with a powerful dribble moving on to his right foot, but the retreating Dembele displays a good bit of strength to win possession back for Spurs."
8',action,"Son collects the ball down the left touchline and opens up his stride with a typically speedy dribble. The South Korean uses the run of Eriksen to cut into space on his right foot, but the resulting strike on goal is fired high and wide over the crossbar with De Gea not troubled between the sticks for the Red Devils."
6',action,"Darmian receives a ball to feet from Herrera from the throw-in and goes to clear up the park, only for Dembele to intervene. Mkhitaryan attempts to reclaim the ball for United, but it is Alderweireld who eventually calms things down for Spurs by sending a pass all the way back to Lloris."
4',action,"A nice tempo to the match in these early stages and Mourinho has clearly made it clear to his charges that a fast start is required. Most of the play from the hosts is going through Mkhitaryan down this right-hand side, who already looks like he is going to give Rose a pretty tough afternoon."
2',action,"SAAAAAVE FROM LLORIS! A cracking start from United who take the game to Spurs with a sweeping attack down the right. It is Ibrahimovic who finds Pogba after some lovely work from Mkhitaryan, but the subsequent strike from the edge of the box from the Frenchman is palmed away by the Spurs stopper."

,action,TEAM NEWS...
,action,"Historically, Old Trafford has not been a happy hunting ground for Tottenham as they have been defeated there 19 times in the Premier League, the most at any away stadium. However, more recently, United have only won two out of the last eight league fixtures against Spurs at home."
,action,"The last clash between United and Tottenham took place in April of this year in the Premier League. On that occasion at White Hart Lane, Mauricio Pochettino's charges secured the London outfit's biggest league win in 20 years against the Red Devils with a 3-0 result, with Dele Alli, Toby Alderweireld, and Erik Lamela all getting on the scoresheet."
,action,"During the week, both sides confirmed European football for themselves after Christmas, but in contrasting circumstances. United will feel content of their place in the knockout stage of the Europa League after comfortably dispatching of FC Zorya, but Spurs' place in the competition comes as a consolation for a very poor Champions League campaign in which they failed to get out the group to progress to the last-16."
,action,"This season so far, the Red Devils and Spurs have found themselves on the periphery of the title race despite huge pre-campaign expectations, and take up fifth and sixth place in the table respectively. Jose Mourinho's men, however, need to worry more about simply qualifying for the Champions League as they are nine points adrift of Manchester City in fourth at the moment."
