,action,"Thanks for joining our commentary this afternoon. Until next time, goodbye."
,action,"Liverpool will see this result as two points dropped, although West Ham may feel the same way as Darren Randolph's mistake in the second half gifted the Reds an equaliser. Both teams were below-par at the back, while neither were at their most clinical going forward which is why a draw is probably a fair result this afternoon."

90',action,Reid continues his fine afternoon with an important challenge on Origi just as the Belgian was about to pull the trigger inside the box.
88',action,"Milner collects on the left flank and carves just enough space to send a cross into the box where Origi waits. However, his cross has too much power on it and it sails over the Belgian's head and into Randolph's gloves."
87',action,Karius has to act to stop Carroll from reaching Payet's cross from the left and he times his leap to perfection to knock the ball away from the forward.
85',action,BLOCK! Nordtveit comes to the rescue for the Hammers with a block to deny Milner. The defender's effort appeared to be heading on target until the Norwegian acted.
83',action,"CHANCE! Mane and Lallana combine to tee up Clyne on the edge of the box, but the defender loses his composure at the vital moment, blazing his shot over the bar."
82',action,"OVER! Space opens up for Payet to shoot from 25 yards, but once he lacks the accuracy from distance, sending his strike well over the bar."
80',action,Ogbonna does extremely well in front of his own goal to clear the ball away from Clyne's cross as it appeared Wijnaldum was going to latch on to it two yards from the net.
78',action,Wijnaldum takes one touch too many in the box as he collects Mane's low cross and Reid clears the danger with a clearing tackle.

67',action,"CHANCE! Firmino cuts the ball back into the middle for Wijnaldum and the Dutchman makes a neat turn, but just gets crowded out before he can shoot, allowing the Hammers to clear the danger."
65',action,"Liverpool are just struggling to find their clinical edge in the final third. They've seen a lot of the ball in the second half, but other then their gift for the equaliser they've struggled in front of the net."
63',substitution,; Carroll comes on against his former club to replace Ayew.
62',action,"CHANCE! Nordtveit is caught well out of position and Wijnaldum raids into the space behind the full-back. He curls an effort towards the bottom corner, only to see his strike drift inches past the post."

50',action,"CHANCE! Wijnaldum is afforded space and time inside the box and he pulls the trigger with a left-footed effort towards the bottom corner, only to see his strike trickle inches past the post."

46',substitution,; Klavan replaces Lovren at the break.
46',action,We're back underway at Anfield.
,action,"Loris Karius was under the spotlight following his performance against Bournemouth, but his struggles have continued this afternoon. As a result, the Reds will have to be on form in the final third in the second half to muster a positive result from this fixture."
,action,"Liverpool's defensive frailties have been exposed again this afternoon as West Ham have come from a goal down to lead 2-1 at the break.

45'+2',action,The first half comes to an end.

39',goal,Goal Michail Antonio ; Goal Michail Antonio
37',action,"CHANCE! Mane causes havoc with a bursting run into the box, but the Hammers get men back to block the strike. Firmino gathers and shoots towards the bottom corner, only to see his shot trickle just past the post."
36',action,"Cresswell surges forward into the final third and with a lack of options he decides to take on the strike, but he pulls his effort wide of the post. Given Karius' struggles you cannot blame the England man for trying his luck."

23',action,"The Hammers are enjoying a good spell of possession, but are yet to test Karius with a meaningful effort at goal. Given his struggles last week, Bilic will want to see his side test the German's handling ability."
21',action,"West Ham commit men forward down the right flank and Milner has to be at his best to stop Payet's cross from reaching the penalty area, although concedes a corner in the process."
19',action,Ogbonna tries to shield a long ball over the top towards his keeper and it has just enough pace to reach Randolph with Mane lurking.
18',action,"West Ham play a few neat passes on the edge of the Liverpool box before the ball comes to Noble on the right flank. He has time to lift a cross into the box, but he generates too much power on the ball and it sails over the bar."
16',action,"The Hammers clear the initial danger, but a new wave of attacks come from the home side as Mane and Milner link up down the left. Only a good clearing header from Reid prevents Origi latching on to the left-back's cross at the near post."

9',action,"WIDE! A simple ball over the top allows Antonio to break behind Lovren. He takes one touch in the box before going for goal from a tight angle, but his effort deflects off the Liverpool defender and heads narrowly past the post."
