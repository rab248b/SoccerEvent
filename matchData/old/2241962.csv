,action,"The victory means that Chelsea now sit seven points clear of Tottenham, who currently lie in second place thanks to their impressive win earlier today. Liverpool can close that gap to five points tomorrow, however, but they'll have to beat Manchester United to do so. For the time being, the Blues are sitting pretty at the summit of the Premier League."
,action,"In the end, it was a very comfortable evening for Chelsea, who were easily able to fire themselves into an early lead and bossed proceedings from then onwards. Despite performing relatively well during the first half, Leicester largely struggled, with an unfamiliar back five failing to successfully deal with a Chelsea side that looked hungry to win after the defeat against Tottenham."
,action,FULL-TIME: LEICESTER CITY 0-3 CHELSEA
90'+2',action,"With the game all but over, Leicester patiently pass the ball around inside the Chelsea half of the pitch, seemingly inviting the referee to blow his whistle for the final time. He eventually does, and grumbles of discontent echo around the King Power Stadium."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be two minutes of added time.
89',action,"The ball pinballs around the edge of the Chelsea penalty area before Fuchs once again tries to test Courtois from a long way out, but the Austrian is unable to catch the ball well enough and his low strike is easily blocked by Azpilicueta before it can reach the Belgian goalkeeper."
87',action,"Leicester come back once again and win themselves a corner over ont he right flank. A dangerous cross is flung into the box and bounces over to Fuchs, who then unleashes a decent volley that is well held by Courtois in the middle of the Chelsea goal."
85',action,"Gray cuts inside from the right flank once again and this time tries to catch out Courtois with a thumping strike from just outside of the penalty area, but it's easily stopped by the Belgian goalkeeper, who has had little to do today but has nonetheless performed well."
84',substitution,"; Meanwhile, Pedro has made way for Ruben Loftus-Cheek."
84',substitution,"; Chelsea have made a late double change. The first player to come on is Michy Batshuayi, who replaces Willian."
83',action,"Moses twists and turns deep down the right flank and does well to beat Chilwell. He then flies into the penalty area before taking on Fuchs, but he goes down far too easily and incurs the wrath of the Leicester fans for what they see as being a cynical dive."
81',action,"Gray, who has done well since coming on to the pitch, gets himself into a good position deep down the right wing after skipping past Pedro, but he's unable to find a teammate inside the box with his swinging cross and can only send it into the arms of Courtois."
79',substitution,; Hazard makes his way off the pitch to be replaced by Cesc Fabregas in Chelsea's first substitution.
78',action,"Chilwell dances his way past both Kante and Azpilicueta before trying to test Courtois from 25 yards out, but, off balance, he ends up firing a speculative shot comfortably over the top of the crossbar and out for a goal-kick."
77',substitution,"; Leicester have made their final alteration of the evening, with Danny Simpson coming on to take the place of Albrighton."
76',action,"Willian breaks into the right-hand side of the Leicester box before firing a low cross over to Hazard at the far post, but Albrighton does well to dive in front of the ball to stop it from finding the Belgian, who would have been presented with a great opportunity to further Chelsea's lead."
75',action,"Leicester come back once again, however, and win a corner through Drinkwater. Fuchs' steps up and tries to pick out a teammate with a looping cross into the heart of the Chelsea penalty area, but it's sent too near to Courtois and the goalkeeper is easily able to collect the ball under very little pressure."
73',action,"Gray makes an immediate impact as he twists and turns deep down the right wing, and he does well to force Matic into clumsily fouling him and giving away a free-kick in a dangerous position. It's Albrighton who curls the set-piece into the box, but it's easily punched away by Courtois."
71',substitution,"; Leicester have made a second change, with Musa making way for Demarai Gray."
71',goal,"Goal Pedro Eliezer Rodr√≠guez Ledesma ; GOAL! Chelsea have made it 3-0! Leicester are caught all over the place at the back as Chelsea easily pass the ball around then. A lovely first-time knock picks out Willian, who rushes towards Schmeichel before chipping the ball back to Pedro, who then beats Morgan in the air and easily nods a header into the bottom left-hand corner of the net. That should be that for the league leaders."
69',action,"The crowd are starting to get frustrated with what they're currently watching. Once again, Leicester quickly try to break forward as they desperately attempt to get back into the game, but sloppy passing in the final third denies the opportunity to do so and instead results in a throw-in for Chelsea."
67',action,"Vital interception by Alonso! Vardy brings the ball down nicely after linking up with Okazaki and then tries to pick out Musa with a clever pass over to the right-hand side of the Chelsea box, but Alonso dives in front of the ball to stop it from finding the Nigerian in a promising position."
65',action,"Alonso almost wraps up his hat-trick! A curling cross from Moses flies right on to the foot of Alonso on the edge of the penalty area, but the wing-back's first-time volley flies agonisingly wide of the far post after leaving Schmeichel rooted to the spot. What a goal that would have been!"
63',action,"Willian's second corner is chipped into the heart of the penalty area and towards one of the several black shirts camped in front of goal, but it's sent too near to Schmeichel and is easily collected by the Danish goalkeeper."
62',action,"Alonso does well down the left flank before winning his side a corner. It's curled into the penalty area and bounces over to Cahill, who pulls off a wonderfully acrobatic overhead kick that deflects off the chest of Morgan and out for another Chelsea corner."
61',action,"Willian cuts inside from the right wing and wiggles away from his marker before firing a low cross towards Hazard, but Albrighton sticks out a foot to stop the Belgian from reaching the ball in a promising position inside the box."
60',substitution,"; Leicester have made their first change of the game, with Huth making way for Shinji Okazaki. It looks as if Leicester are switching to four at the back as they search for a way back into the game."

55',action,"Azpilicueta is put under pressure by Vardy and is forced into poking the ball out for a throw-in deep down the left wing. Fuchs steps up and sends another looping ball into box, but Albrighton is unable to make decent contact with the ball and isntead knocks it out for a goal-kick."
53',action,"Leicester quickly push forward from the restart as they try to find a way back into the game, but Luiz is easily able to deal with the danger on the edge of the Chelsea penalty area before being caught by a late challenge from Vardy, who looks visibly frustrated."
51',goal,"Goal Marcos Alonso Mendoza ; GOAL! It's 2-0 to Chelsea! Willian curls the resulting set-piece into the middle of the penalty area, where it's headed out to Alonso. The wing-back is in a pocket of space on the edge of the box and immediately unleashes a shot, and it's one that deflects off the outstretched leg of Morgan and into the bottom left-hand corner of the net."
51',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Christian Fuchs ; A lofted pass is flung up to Willian and finds the Brazilian deep down the left wing, but he's cynically dragged back by Fuchs and wins his side a free-kick in a dangerous position near to the corner flag."
49',action,"Chelsea try to find joy down the right flank once again, this time through Azpilicueta, but the Spaniard is unable to break past Chilwell and ends up going to ground before running the ball out of play.

48',action,"Chelsea revert to patiently passing the ball around inside the Leicester half of the pitch before Moses eventually tries to take on Chilwell, but the youngster comes out on top and denies the Nigeria international a way into the hosts' penalty area."

,action,"Chelsea enjoyed a wonderful start to the game thanks to a great strike from Alonso, but since then they've failed to create many chances, resulting in the first half being a bit of a drab affair. Leicester have seen most of the ball but have also struggled to carve out opportunities on goal, despite Albrighton looking bright down the right wing. Chelsea have also been slightly sloppy defensively on a few occasions, and that will surely give the home side some confidence heading into the second half."

37',action,"Leicester go close! A clever pass from Albrighton finds Vardy, who then quickly spins past Cahill on the right-hand side of the Chelsea penalty area.

33',action,"It's all gone a bit quiet as Chelsea calmly hold on to possession in the middle of the pitch. The league leaders have created very few chances since going ahead, leaving their front three of Pedro, Hazard and Willian looking slightly isolated."
31',action,"Chelsea patiently pass the ball around midway inside the Leicester half of the pitch before Matic tries to test Kasper Schmeichel from 30 yards out, but, unsurprisingly, his long-range effort fails to beat Morgan on the edge of the penalty area and is easily dealt with by the defender."
29',action,"A half-hearted Chelsea attacking move breaks down and Leicester immediately hit the visitors on a counter-attack. They initially do so well thanks to a marauding run forward from Albrighton, but the midfielder is unable to pick out Vardy inside the box and instead sees his cross headed away by Luiz."
27',action,"A lofted pass is fired up to Chilwell, who had made a good run down the left wing, but he's unable to find a way past Moses and ends up conceding a goal-kick before he's able to swing a cross into the Chelsea penalty area. Nonetheless, Leicester are doing much better than they were at the start of the game."

22',action,"N'Golo Kante brings down Nampalys Mendy 30 yards away from the Chelsea goal and concedes a free-kick in a dangerous position. It's Albrighton who fires the ball into the box, but Matic is just about able to get a touch on it before Gary Cahill concedes a corner."
21',action,"Once again, Leicester cause problems down the right wing.

16',action,"Albrighton, who has had few opportunities to push forward due to the pressure being put on him by Alonso, is left in a pocket of space and quickly curls a cross into the Chelsea penalty area. It should be easily dealt with but somehow flies towards Jamie Vardy, who, under pressure from Luiz, is unable to reach the ball in a dangerous position."
14',action,"After a lengthy period on the back foot, Leicester are able to push forward once again. A lofted pass is flung up to Musa, who then battles with Luiz on the edge of the Chelsea box, but it's the Brazilian who comes out on top and the league leaders immediately break forward on a quick counter-attack."

6',goal,"Goal Marcos Alonso Mendoza ; GOAL! Chelsea have taken an early lead! The league leaders patiently work the ball around before a curling cross is fired into the penalty area by Azpilicueta.

4',action,"Robert Huth drags back Willian and concedes a free-kick in a dangerous position over on the right flank. The set-piece is sent short before a lofted pass finds Victor Moses deep down the wing, but he loses out to Chilwell and has to settle for a throw-in."

1',action,"Despite the teamsheet indicating otherwise, it looks as if Leicester are lining up with three at the back. It seems Ben Chilwell and Marc Albrighton with operate as wing-backs in an attempt to nullify an impressive Chelsea side."

,action,"Just one defeat from their last four league games represents Leicester‚Äôs best return since the end of October, but, despite the struggles of each of the teams sitting below them, they still desperately require victories if they‚Äôre to turn their season around. They managed to pick a morale-boosting win against Everton in the FA Cup last weekend, and Claudio Ranieri will be hoping that the victory at Goodison Park can help spur them on to a similar result here today."
,action,"Today‚Äôs game may¬†be between the current leaders and last season‚Äôs champions, but the current positions of the two sides couldn‚Äôt be any more different. A tough first half of the season for Leicester has left them languishing in the bottom half of the table, although a much-needed recent win against West Ham United has helped send them six points clear of the dreaded relegation zone."
,action,"The fallout with Costa couldn‚Äôt have come at a worse time for Chelsea, who finally had their excellent¬†winning run brought to an end by Tottenham Hotspur in their last league outing. Despite the defeat, their first in the Premier League since September 24th, they remain top of the table, but the gap between them and Spurs now stands at four points after the latter‚Äôs earlier win against West Bromwich Albion."
,action,"All of the talk in the build-up to today‚Äôs big clash was concerned with Diego Costa, who has been in excellent form for Chelsea this season but finds himself out of the team after an apparent bust-up with Antonio Conte over alleged links to a Chinese club. As a result, Eden Hazard is once against thrust into a false nine role as the Blues try to return to winning ways in the absence of their star striker."
