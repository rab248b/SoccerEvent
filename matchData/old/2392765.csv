89',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Nathaniel Chalobah ; Chalobah is shown a yellow for a foul on Woods late on here, the first for Chelsea to go into the book this afternoon."
87',action,"Both teams have closed up shop here. Chelsea are enjoying harmless possession just inside the halfway line, with Brentford not putting up much of a fight anymore to win it back. There may be just six miles separating these local rivals, but the gulf in class is immense."
85',action,STAT: Brentford have not won an away match in the FA Cup since a 2-0 victory over Boreham Wood in November 2012.
83',action,"Never in doubt, this match, it must be said. Aside from a good opening 10 minutes to the second half from Brentford, this has been a dominating display from the Blues, who have led since the 14th minute. The scoreboard says four, but it could very well be a larger lead."
81',penalty-goal,"Penalty Goal Michy Batshuayi Tunga ; NO MISTAKE! Batshuayi converts from the spot, sending the keeper the wrong way, and that goal will mean a lot to him!"
80',action,"PENALTY TO CHELSEA! What an impact this has been off the bench from Ivanovic! He does well to get on the inside of Barbet to get onto a pass from Costa, before being needlessly tackled to ground by the wing-back!"
78',substitution,"; Egan is back out with a bandage wrapped around his head, so instead it's McEachran who is replaced here by Kostantin Kerschbaumer."
76',substitution,; A deserved standing ovation for Pedro for a dynamic showing today. He's replaced here by Diego Costa.
74',action,STAT: Pedro has three goals and two assists in his last two FA Cup matches.
73',action,"Play comes to a halt and the training staff is forced to come out onto the pitch to attend to Egan, who has gone down with a head injury for Brentford. They still do have one substitution left to make, thankfully, should they need it."
71',substitution,; Chelsea make their second change of the afternoon as Kenedy replaces Azpilicueta.
69',assist,Assist Pedro Eliezer Rodríguez Ledesma ; An assist for Pedro to go with his goal.
69',goal,"Goal Branislav Ivanović ; THAT SEALS IT! Pedro, who has been Chelsea's most consistent player on the afternoon, plays through Ivanovic on the break and the substitute makes no mistake, powering a finish past Bentley at the near post!"
67',action,"Chelsea going in search of the third goal that will remove all doubt. Brentford have done an excellent job of clawing their way back into this game in the second half, and though they still don't have a goal to show for it, it has increased the tension a bit at Stamford Bridge."
65',substitution,"; Jota Peleteiro replaces Vibe, as Brentford completely revamp their attack with 25 minutes remaining."
64',substitution,"; Striker Scott Hogan enters the fray for Brentford, replacing Sawyers."
64',substitution,"; A first change for Chelsea sees Branislav Ivanovic replace Willian. He will assume the role of wing-back, pushing Pedro further forward."
63',action,"ALL BUT THE FINISH! Yennaris does expertly to take Woods' pass in stride and somehow turn between the challenges of both Azpilicueta and Terry, but can't beat Begovic in the end, who gets off his line in a flash to close down the angle!"
61',action,"STAT: Chelsea have won 13 of their last four 14 matches in all competitions, losing only to Spurs earlier this month."
59',action,"CLOSE! Willian skips through the heart of midfiled and slips through a lovely little ball for Loftus-Cheek, who nearly produces the perfect finish with his weaker foot, grazing the top of the crossbar as his chipped effort drifts behind for a goal-kick."
57',action,"Brentford's spell on top to start the second half has largely gone now, and they have nothing to show for it. Those opportunities will be few and far between, so they can ill-afford to squander them like they just did. Nonetheless, it's got the away fans singing a bit again."
55',yellow-card,Yellow Card Maxime Colin ; Colin picks up the first yellow card of this forth-round tie.
54',action,"Awkward landing here for Zouma, who somewhat cynically has his legs taken out from under him by Sawyers. It's a real heart in the stomach moment for Chelsea and the French centre-half, who's really still just getting back into the flow of things after a lengthy spell in the infirmary with a knee injury."
52',action,STAT: Their 2013 defeat to Chelsea was the last time Brentford made it beyond Round 3 of the FA Cup – they haven't made the fifth round since 2005/06.
50',action,"Nervy moments for Chelsea in the early stages of the second half, but they're awarded a welcome break to collect themselves, as Willian goes down following a challenge from McEachran, which leaves the Brazilian in need of a bit of attention."
48',action,"HAS TO BE FINISHED! Much better from Brentford, who come out of the gate showing some intensity once and for all. Suddenly Terry finds himself under pressure and Vibe gets into a threatening position at the far post, but he's not decisive enough as Begovic charges off his line to poke the ball free!"
46',action,Back underway at Stamford Bridge!
,action,"Chelsea's first-half domination has paid dividends as goals from Willian and Pedro see the Premier League leaders into the interval with a comfortable 2-0 lead that, with all due respect to Brentford, could have been much worse."
45'+1',action,HALF-TIME: CHELSEA 2-0 BRENTFORD.
45',action,There will be just one minute added on at the end of this first half.
43',action,"Successive corners here for Brentford as they desperately search for a lifeline before the interval. Vibe does well to flick on at the near post, but Begovic parries, before the Danish striker gets back on the ball to force yet another corner - though this time Chelsea deal with the threat accordingly."
41',action,STAT: Brentford's last win over Chelsea came in February 1939 (D1 L4 since).
39',action,"BENTLEY SAVES! Fabregas the architect again, springing Loftus-Cheek into space via the right channel. It's a strong bit of running from the winger, who strikes with power upon arriving at the penalty area, but Bentley does well to parry, sending the rebound away from the danger area with Batshuayi lurking."
37',action,"Fabregas is running things in midfield and Brentford can do or say little to stop him. The Spaniard is picking out one terrific delivery after another, putting the ball exactly where he wants it. This is a real humbling experience for the Bees against their west London rivals."
35',action,"Chelsea are showing no signs of taking their foot off the gas, and Brentford don't appear capable of slowing them, either. It's a dangerous combination that could see the Blues put the final nail in the coffin if they can find a third goal before the break."
33',action,"OFFSIDE! A stunning diagonal ball over the top from Fabregas results in a great chance for Batshuayi from point-blank range, which he finishes confidently, only to be denied by the offside flag this time! The former Marseille striker somehow still doesn't have a goal for himself."
31',action,"SUPTUOUS EFFORT! An absolute cannon of a strike from Loftus-Cheek, who stings the palm of Bentley from 25 yards, but the keeper just manages to parry behind for a corner! Loftus-Cheek has impressed a great deal in the opening half-hour."
29',action,STAT: Chelsea have been eliminated just twice in their last 20 appearances in the FA Cup fourth round (Everton in 2011 and Bradford City in 2015).
27',action,"WAS IT IN?! Terry heads back across goal for Batshuayi from a corner, and although the striker's initial header is blocked by his own team-mate, he collects the rebound and appears to stuff it in at the near post, but Bentley does just enough to keep it from fully crossing the line! Remember, there's no goal-line technology in the FA Cup, but that was the right call, nonetheless."
25',action,"Better spell, this, from Brentford, as they keep the ball for a prolonged spell in midfield. None of their possession is coming in the danger areas, however. They really need to carve out a chance or two, just for the sake of their own confidence, even."
23',action,"The league leaders are looking every bit the part this afternoon, despite resting many of their first-team regulars. It goes to show not only what great depth they have, but how committed everyone is to Antonio Conte's system."
21',assist,"Assist Michy Batshuayi Tunga ; Beautifully switched throughball from Batshuayi, playing it diagonally across the defence to pick out the run of Pedro, as he's credited with the assist."
21',goal,"Goal Pedro Eliezer Rodríguez Ledesma ; THAT'S TWO! It's shaping up to be a long afternoon for Brentford as they're carved apart for the 2-0. Batshuayi picks out a stunning throughball to play Pedro in on the right, and he finishes appropriately at the near post!"
20',action,"STAT: Chelsea won 4-0 in the fourth-round replay when they last met, following a 2-2 draw in Brentford. All six of the Blues’ goals came in the second half of those matches."
18',action,"OUTSTANDING DEFENDING! That's the best attack of the match thus far for Brentford, as Vibe's smart diagonal run is picked out by an equally impressive throughball from McEachran, but Azpilicueta shows great strength to fend off the striker and block him from going through on goal."
16',action,"Chelsea right back on the front foot after taking the lead a few moments ago. It's all been very clinical and comfortable from the Blues thus far. This is the start Brentford would have had nightmares about, falling behind so early."
14',goal,"Goal Willian Borges da Silva ; SCORCHER! CHELSEA LEAD! Hit with plenty of pace from Willian, despite the short run up, and he whips it around the wall, bending it just inside the near post! No chance for Bentley to get a hand to that and Chelsea have the early lead they craved!"
13',action,"Pedro does well with a quick change in direction to win the Blues a free-kick just outside the area, with Vibe penalised for obstructing the Spaniard's path. This will be a real chance for Chelsea to open the scoring, with Willian and Fabregas standing over it."
11',action,"Chelsea break quickly through WIllian, following a Brentford corner. The Brazilian surges down the right with speed to burn, and had Ake arriving with support at the far post, but just can't get enough power on his cross to pick him out."
9',action,"Nowhere close! Chelsea do well to work the ball around the fringes of the Brentford penalty area, as pressure builds on their goal. Pedro and Fabregas work a clever one-two, but the former's shot from 20 yards lifts wildly over the bar in the end."
7',action,"STAT: Chelsea and Brentford last met in the FA Cup in 2012/13, with the Blues needing a fourth-round replay to see off the Bees."
5',action,"It's early still, but it actually looks as though Pedro is playing in the wing-back role, with Loftus-Cheek flanking Batshuayi. It's a bit of a foreign position for the Spaniard, but he shouldn't have too much defending to do with Brentford not figuring to have much in terms of possession."
3',action,"Ponderous possession from Chelsea in the opening minutes. It looks as though Brentford will not press high up the pitch, allowing the Blues comfortable possession in their own end before quickly closing down on the ball once the hosts get across the halfway line."
1',action,"AND THEY'RE OFF! Brentford in red and white stripes as they get us underway, attacking left to right."
,action,"Dean Smith makes just one change from last weekend's defeat to Wigan. Yoann Barbet is brought into the three-man defence, with Andreas Bjelland pushing forward into a wing-back role, which sees teenager Tom Field drop to the bench."
,action,"Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Nathan Ake, who was just recently recalled from his loan at Bournemouth, fill in at wing-back, with Nathaniel Chalobah partnering the experienced Cesc Fabregas in midfield. Michy Batshuayi gets a rare opportunity to lead the line, where he will be flanked by Willian and the aforementioned Pedro."
,action,"Antonio Conte has firmly rotated his squad in advance of their trip to Anfield on Tuesday, making nine changes from the victory over Hull, with just Azpilicueta and Pedro keeping their place. Asmir Begovic gets a rare start in goal, while skipper John Terry is restored at the back, as is Kurt Zouma."
