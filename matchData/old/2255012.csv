85',action,"Chandler marauds up the right flank for the umpteenth time in this match, but delusions of grandeur means the full-back cuts inside to shoot on his left foot. The less said about that attempt the better."

77',action,CHANCE! Seferovic should have finished the match. Chandler does well up the right side again and gets behind the Dortmund defence. The full-back manages to cross to the Swiss striker unmarked in the box but he turns his effort wide of the mark.
76',action,"Frankfurt are starting to retreat a bit and aren't pressing Dortmund as high up the pitch, which is allowing the away side more time on the ball in defence, but despite this they're unable to break down the Black and White defence."

54',action,"CLOSE! A free-kick is whipped into the Dortmund box which is headed clear by Ramos, but only as far as Gacinovic who cuts inside onto his right foot to shoot however it goes just wide of the post."
52',action,Frankfurt have started this half so bright. Weigl is being forced to sit so deep in order assist with defending which is preventing the youngster from dictating the game which we've seen many times this season.
50',action,"Almost another chance for Frankfurt as a long ball is played forward to Meier, but the striker tries to turn inside of Sokratis and ends up collapsing over his own ankle. Fortunately for the hosts he's able to continue."

45'+4',yellow-card,Yellow Card Marco Jhonfai Fabián De La Mora.Fabian collects a yellow card.

42',action,"Frankfurt are finally starting to craft some chances for themselves, but it's coming at the wrong time for them with half time on the horizon. Although, Kovac will be extremely happy with how his side have defended so far."

29',action,"CLOSE! A cross is played into the box by Schurrle on the left side and Ramos manages to peel away from Abraham in the box, but is header is wide of Hradecky's right post."
27',action,Frankfurt aren't having much time on the ball in this match and when they do they're wasting possession. The hosts are panicking and forcing their passes long rather than composing themselves and playing football.
25',action,Castro again picking up space on the edge of the box without being pressured but fortunately for the hosts his pass into the box is poor and Abraham is able to clear with ease.
23',action,"Dortmund are starting to find a lot of room in midfield with the forward of Frankfurt pressing the defence of the visitors, but the midfield is dropping a couple of inches too deep which is allowing Castro and Weigl lots to work with."
21',action,"CLOSE! Castro is allowed far too much room in the centre of the pitch and is able to pick a pass to Aubameyang with ease, although the Frankfurt defensive line held itself well and the Gabon striker was judged to be offside."
19',action,"SAVE! Hradecky called into action as Frankfurt were undone form the pace of Schurrle and Aubameyang, with the latter releasing the former on goal, but Vellejo forces the German foward wide and he's only able to shoot at the goalkeeper."

15',action,"CHANCE! A long ball forward from Sokratis finds Schurrle behind the Frankfurt back line, but the German international is unable to guide the ball around Hradecky who catches with ease."
13',action,"Neither goalkeeper really tested just yet. Hradecky has had a quite game so far with little to do, although it does look as if Dortmund are more dangerous this afternoon."
11',action,"Frankfurt almost find themselves with a chance as a cross is played into the box by Oczipka, but Meier is unable to control the ball and an unfortunate bounce takes it away from him and into the path of Weidenfeller."
9',action,"Dortmund are starting to command the match now as they get the better share of the possession, although it must be said Frankfurt are maintaining their shape well and it's making life difficult for the visitors."
7',action,"Neat pass Castro allows Schurrle to find some room on the left side and cut inside of Abraham, however just as he tries to work a shot it's deflected out for a corner."
5',action,"First corner of the match goes the way of Eintracht Frankfurt which is cleared at the near post by Sokratis, but play is brought to a halt as Schurrle clashes with the referee and the latter of the two comes out winded."
