,action,Liverpool were held to a 0-0 draw by League Two side Plymouth Argyle today at Anfield. It was a terrific defensive performance by the Pilgrims as they dealt with everything that the Premier League side could throw at them.
,action,FULL-TIME: LIVERPOOL 0-0 PLYMOUTH
90'+7',action,That's the final whistle!
90'+5',action,Final minute of the game and Liverpool have a corner! Surely not. Plymouth defend it well and clear the danger.
90'+4',action,"IT WAS ALMOST IN! Heart in mouth times for Plymouth! Liverpool had a free-kick and there were plenty of players in the box, the set piece was a poor one but the ball bounced off Connor Smith at the far post and almost sneaked in! McCormick did very well to get across quickly and dive on the ball."
90'+3',action,"Liverpool are piling on the pressure here, however Plymouth are remaining strong at the back and are clearing any danger that comes there way. Just a couple more minutes left to play, can Argyle hold on?"
90',action,Six minutes of added time will be played here!
88',action,"Plymouth are playing with plenty of confidence now, they are desperate to come away with a draw and repeat this game at Home Park."
85',action,"CHANCE PLYMOUTH! Jervis goes brilliantly to outpace Moreno and Lucas, he runs through on goal but drags his shot well wide of the Liverpool goal. Perhaps he should've tried to pick out Tanner who was in a good position in the box."
84',action,"Another Liverpool corner! Which Argyle once again defend well and manage to clear, however Liverpool are back at it straight away and Sturridge once again tries his luck from the edge of the box but it goes just wide of the goal."
81',action,Sturridge goes close! Firmino lifts a ball into the box and is met by Sturridge who rose above Bradley but his header goes narrowly over the crossbar. McCormick looked slightly worried!
80',action,"As we enter the final 10 minutes of the game it is still 0-0 here at Anfield. Liverpool are pressing hard for a goal but are still lacking that final touch. McCormick has done well in goal for Plymouth but he hasn't had to make many outstanding saves, which is credit to the hard-working Argyle defenders."
79',action,"Tanner almost breaks through clear on goal! Nearly a fantastic counter-attack as Tanner races through, however Stewart got across well and made a potentially game saving tackle!"
78',action,The Liverpool big guns are starting to link up well and they have certainly increased the pace of this game as the Reds look for a winning goal. Plymouth are once again camped inside their own half.
76',substitution,"; Gary Miller comes off on a stretcher with what looks like a bad injury, he is replaced by Connor Smith."
75',substitution,; Third and final substitution by Liverpool as the 17-year-old Ben Woodburn comes off to be replaced by Roberto Firmino.
75',substitution,; The first of a double substitution for Liverpool with Oviemuno Ejaria being replaced by Adam Lallana.
73',action,Miller is down and receiving a lot of medical treatment here after an awkward landing. Looks like his game is over.
71',action,Another Liverpool set piece in a dangerous position as Ojo used his pace and tricky to beat Purrington and the left-back had to bring him down. Moreno whipped the ball into the box but the Argyle defence once again clear the danger.
69',action,Sturridge again causes the Plymouth defence problems! It was great play by the forward to lift a ball into the box which Ojo came inches away from getting on the end of. McCormick read the danger and came out quickly to collect the ball before Ojo could turn it into the back of the net.
67',action,Very good chance for Tanner! The substitute does brilliantly to skip around a couple of tackles on the right wing and then made his way into the box. But he then really should pass have passed to an open team-mate for a shot instead of going himself and seeing his effort blocked.
65',substitution,; Arnold Paul Garita couldn't run off his injury and he comes off to be replace by Craig Tanner.
64',action,CLOSE! Daniel Sturridge goes very close to giving Liverpool the lead! The striker gets the ball out of his feet quickly and fires a low shot at goal which causes McCormick to scrabble across his goal. However the Plymouth keeper was very happy to see that go the other side of his post.
63',substitution,; First substitution of the game as Emre Can comes off to be replaced by Daniel Sturridge.
61',action,Brief stoppage in play as Garita receives some medical treatment following a heavy challenge. However the striker looks like he will be able to run this off.
60',action,The Pilgrims have been eliminated in each of their last 11 FA Cup meetings against Premier League opposition; their most recent win was against West Brom in the fifth round all the way back in the 1983/84 campaign.
57',action,"Liverpool press forward once again! Moreno plays the ball back to Lucas who tries his luck from distance, it was a good effort and McCormick had to dive to his right to make the save. The Plymouth looked surprised by the shot from long-range."
55',action,"Karius makes his first save of the game! Carey takes a free-kick with his left foot, he whips it over the wall but Karius is across quickly to gather the ball."
54',action,CHANCE LIVERPOOL! Ojo should've scored! Woodburn once again beat Miller down the left and whipped a ball towards the far post were Ojo was waiting. Ojo got up well but put his header the wrong side of the post! McCormick wouldn't have saved that if it was on target!
52',action,"STAT: Argyle have never won at Anfield in their entire history, drawing two and losing three games in the second tier between 1954 and 1961."
50',action,"Plymouth have their first shot at goal! Slew gets time and space on the edge of the box but the Argyle man doesn't hit the ball well and his attempt almost goes out for a throw-in! Still, a shot at goal all the same!"
48',action,Garita uses his presence to storm down the left wing and win a free-kick for his side. Carey whips a ball into the box but Loris Kauris comes out and gathers the ball on the six-yard box.
47',action,"Liverpool have started this second-half just as they ended the opening period, in control of the ball and looking to break the deadlock."
46',action,The second-half is underway! Plymouth get us going.
,action,The teams are back out and the second-half is almost ready to get underway!
,action,The only thing missing from the Reds performane so far has been a goal. Otherwise it has been so comfortable for Liverpool. Plymouth have defended well in numbers and have kept them out. McCormick produced a fine save to deny Woodburn early on but that is the closest the hosts have come to unlocking this Argyle defence.
,action,HALF-TIME: LIVERPOOL 0-0 PLYMOUTH
45'+2',action,That's the half-time whistle!
45'+1',action,"Great counter-attack by Plymouth! They've won a free-kick near the corner flag and the big defenders have come forward, can they grab a shock goal? Unfortunately not, Liverpool clear the danger."
45',action,There will be a minimum of one minute added on here.
44',action,Arnold-Paul Garita is trying to make a nuisance of himself when Plymouth do move forward with the ball. The striker is using his physical presence to put pressure on Lucas and Joe Gomez. Unfortunately he hasn't had any support so far today as Liverpool have had 81% of possession!
42',action,"Jurgen Klopp has plenty of Premier League stars on the bench for the Reds, with the likes of Adam Lallana and Daniel Strurridge, we may see a few changes early on if the scoreline stays the same."
40',action,Just five minutes to go until the half-time whistle here at Anfield. Liverpool are dominating proceedings but they have struggled to carve out any clear-cut chances so far. The best attempt so far coming from Woodburn early on.
38',action,"Ironic cheers from the Plymouth fans as they enjoy a minute or two of possession, they make their way into the Liverpool half but Lucas uses all of his experience to regain possession for the hosts. Liverpool attack once again!"
35',action,"Oscar Threlkeld makes a silly foul, clipping Ojo on the edge of the box which gives Liverpool a very good opportunity from the free-kick.! Origi steps up to take but he fires it straight at the Plymouth wall."
34',action,"Almost an own goal! Miller does his best to clear Moreno's corner, the right-back knew he had to get something on the ball but he almost turned that into the back of his own net! The resutling corner comes to nothing."
32',action,Miller gives away a sloppy free-kick for a foul on Stewart. The Argyle right-back didn't need to go in that strong on the Liverpool man and the referee awards a set-piece. However the Reds don't capitalise on the opportunity and Plymouth once again clear the danger for a few seconds.
30',action,Still 0-0 as we reach the half-hour mark here at Anfield. Liverpool have been the dominate team but have yet to break through the Plymouth defensive line.
28',action,"Can does well to meet a couple of Plymouth players on the edge of the box before he is crowded out, however the ball falls nicely to Stewart who lines up a shot - but it doesn't come close to troubling McCormick in the Argyle net."
26',action,"It's all Liverpool at the moment, surely an opening goal isn't too far away? The Plymouth fans are doing their best to get behind their team and support their players as it has been a defensive job so far."
24',action,"Plymouth need to find a way of trying to keep the ball for a period of time. They've been camped inside their own half for 90% of this game so far and Liverpool look very dangerous going forward. Woodburn almost dribbles the ball into the back of the net, but he just ran out of room under pressure from the recovering Argyle defence."
21',action,GOAL DISALLOWED! Divock Origi fires the ball into the back of the net but the referee rightly awards a free-kick to Plymouth after the Liverpool striker had his hands all over Gary Miller.
19',action,Liverpool are enjoying a lot of success down the left flank at the moment. Moreno is pressing high and getting forward to support his attacking teammates which is causing Plymouth problems defensively.
16',action,CHANCE LIVERPOOL! First save of the game is made by McCormick to deny Woodburn from close range. The 17-year-old was played through by Can and he pulls the ball onto his left foot but the Plymouth keeper gets to him quickly and makes a fine save.
14',action,"Another corner here for Liverpool, once again taken by Moreno but Can and Lucas can't get on the end of the deep ball into the box. However Grant fouls Woodburn on the edge of the box and Liverpool have a free-kick in a very good position. Can takes, but hits it straight at Sonny Bradley. The deflection reaches Ojo but his header is weak and Luke McCormick gathers the ball."
13',action,"This is the first FA Cup meeting between Liverpool and Plymouth Argyle - they last met in a fixture of any kind in April 1962, when they played in a second tier fixture at Home Park."
11',action,Here come Liverpool once again. They've got Argyle sat deep on the edge of their own box and the Reds midfield are probing. Ben Woodburn and Kevin Stewart look very lively here today and are stretching the visitors backline.
9',action,"Little spell of possession for Plymouth in the Liverpool half, with Ben Purrington doing well down the left wing and he whips a ball into the box for Jervis but Moreno deals with it well."
6',action,"Plymouth are doing a good job so far, keeping their formation and not allowing Liverpool too much time and space when they move forward. Jake Jervis has just done well to earn a corner deep in Liverpool's half, using his terrific pace to put pressure on Moreno. However they waste the opportunity and Liverpool have the ball once again."
4',action,"Bright start by the hosts here, the Reds are enjoying a spell of possession and looking to move forward at every opportunity. Lucas is captaining the side today and he will be a key player in helping a lot of the Liverpool youngsters in the side."
2',action,"Liverpool corner within the first 90 seconds of the game! Albert Moreno comes over to whip it in with his left foot but Emre Can missing the ball and Plymouth get the ball out of the box. Oluwaseyi Ojo then picks the ball up on the edge of the box, but his shot goes well wide of the Plymouth goal."
2',action,"Liverpool have never lost an FA Cup game against a team from the fourth tier! Plus they have advanced from the FA Cup third round on each of their last five attempts, last failing to do so back in 2010/11 when they were knocked out by Manchester United."
