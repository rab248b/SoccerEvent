,action,"Boos ring around the stadium as the two teams make their way off the pitch, and it's no wonder why. Villarreal were excellent and fully deserved to go 2-0 up, but after that they were torn apart by a rampant Madrid side who were finally able to fire on all cylinders. The league leaders left it late, but they showed why they are such a force to be reckoned with, resulting in them leaving with three much-needed points."

,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this evening…"
,action,"Villarreal did well to hold Madrid to a 1-1 draw in September’s meeting at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu, and recent meetings between the two teams have often proven to be close affairs. Last season’s corresponding fixture ended in a 1-0 victory for tonight’s hosts, whilst Madrid have won on just one of their previous four visits to this part of the east coast."
,action,"Only Valencia have managed to get the better of Villarreal in the league since the start of December, although Fran Escriba’s side have won only four of those 10 games. They’ve proven to be a difficult team to break down, resulting in them conceding only four goals during that time. Their defensive record (they’ve let it only 15 goals all campaign) is comfortably the best in La Liga, and that could prove problematic for Madrid tonight."
,action,"As for Villarreal, they are enjoying a good run at the moment as they try to consolidate their place in the Europa League qualification spots. They currently sit in sixth place thanks to a four-game unbeaten run, with Real Sociedad, who sit five points ahead of them in fifth, the latest to fall to the Yellow Submarine."
,action,"Madrid do still have a game in hand over their rivals, however, but, with things as tight at the top as they currently are, they will be well aware that they can’t afford any more slips like last weekend’s. Before then, Zinedine Zidane’s men had won all of their previous four games, but just five wins from their last 10 clashes represents a slightly worrying run of form for the club from the capital."
,action,"Last weekend’s surprising defeat away to Valencia means that Madrid start the day in second place after being knocked off the top of the table by Barcelona. Their main challengers for the title narrowly squeezed past Atletico Madrid earlier today, leaving Los Blancos in need of a victory if they are to head back to the summit once again."
,action,Good evening and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s La Liga game between Villarreal and Real Madrid at the Estadio de la Ceramica.
