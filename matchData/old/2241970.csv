,action,"Arsenal move into second place as a result of the win! That's the end of our live coverage here from north London, thanks for following along. Goodbye!"
,action,"An absolutely tremendous match at the Emirates ends in the most dramatic fashion, as Alexis Sanchez snatches 10-man Arsenal the points with virtually the last kick of the match, after it looked like Burnley had secured a draw with Andre Gray's 93rd minute penalty!"
90'+9',action,FULL-TIME: ARSENAL 2-1 BURNLEY.
90'+8',penalty-goal,"Penalty Goal Alexis Alejandro Sánchez Sánchez ; COOL AS YOU'D LIKE! It's a dinky penalty at such a crucial moment from Sanchez, but it gets the job done! Three points for Arsenal, surely!"
90'+7',action,"WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT! ARSENAL AWARDED A PENALTY! Sanchez lifts a tremendous delivery in for Koscielny at the far post, and the centre-half is caught by a high boot from Mee, prompting Moss to point to the spot! This is pure, unadulterated, unscripted drama!"
90'+7',yellow-card,Yellow Card Ashley Barnes ; Yellow card Ashley Barnes
90'+5',yellow-card,Yellow Card Shkodran Mustafi ; Mustafi picks up a yellow card and Wenger is sent down the tunnel! Arsenal have completely lost their cool here! What an unbelievable turn of events in stoppage-time!
90'+3',penalty-goal,"Penalty Goal Andre Gray ; HE'S DONE IT! Gray smashes it down the middle and for just a fourth time this season, Burnley have an away goal, and it's a huge one for them, as it has them poised to avoid defeat here in north London, a rarity for them!"
90'+2',action,"PENALTY TO BURNLEY! Coquelin can have few complaints as he clearly trips up Barnes, who had crept in from behind the Arsenal midfielder! What a moment this could be for the Clarets!"
90',action,A chorus of discontent echoes around the Emirates as the board goes up to indicate seven minutes of time added on.
89',substitution,"; Another change here for the Gunners, their last of the match, sees Hector Bellerin come on to help see this lead out, with Ozil the one replaced."
87',substitution,"; Arsenal's second change sees Danny Welbeck replace Giroud for the final few minutes - ending the Frenchman's streak of scoring in each of his last nine starts for the Gunners, before today."
85',action,"Tarkowski is presented with a shooting chance from the edge of the box, but he can't navigate his effort through the crowd of bodies. A smart pass out from the back helps Arsenal break, and Ramsey, who finds himself isolated high up the pitch, does very well to win his side a throw and relieve the pressure."
83',action,STAT: Granit Xhaka's sending off was his fifth red card in league play since the start of last season - more than any player in Europe's big five leagues.
81',action,"It's wonderfully poised as we enter the final 10 minutes at the Emirates. Burnley are in the ascendency, although it's proving somewhat of a slow process, while Arsenal cling to this narrow lead, down a man."
79',action,"Burnley have adopted some good urgency to their game now, getting forward in numbers as they search for an equaliser. A bit of a scramble in the area proves troubling for the Arsenal defence, with Mustafi down after taking an elbow to the face from Vokes, but the pressure is relieved as Cech is able to collect."
77',substitution,"; Burnley use the stoppage to make their final change as well, with striker Sam Vokes replacing Defour."
76',substitution,"; This appears an ominous one for Marney, who is carried off on a stretcher, with his head buried in his hands. He's replaced by James Tarkowski."
74',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Dean Marney ; Careless and cynical from Marney who slides in to take Ozil to ground, stopping a break. He gets absolutely none of the ball, and winds up being the one to take the worst of the coming together, as he jars his knee. The training staff comes out to attend to him, with Jonathan Moss lurking over, ready to show him a yellow card."
73',substitution,"; Hendrick, who has been a spectator throughout, is replaced for the final 15 minutes or so by Joey Barton."
71',action,"Marney wins his side a free-kick high up the pitch, and it's Defour who produces a strong effort from the resulting set-piece, but Cech manages to parry. Successive corners ensue for Burnley, but they come to nothing as Arsenal defend the threat accordingly."
69',substitution,"; An adjustment here from Wenger, who introduces Francis Coquelin to fill the void in midfield, with Iwobi the one replaced."
67',action,"In fairness to Xhaka, the challenge looked worse live than it did on the replay. A straight red may be a bit harsh here, especially given how Moss has chose to call the game up to this point, but the Arsenal midfielder only has himself to blame. The pass was sloppy and the ensuing challenge all a bit unnecessary, as there was no immediate threat."
65',red-card,"Red Card Granit Xhaka ; ARSENAL DOWN TO 10 MEN! For the second time this season, Jonathan Moss has sent off Xhaka! It's a sloppy pass from the midfielder, who lunges in with a rash challenge to try and win it straight back from Defour, and after a quick consultation with his assistant, Moss issues a straight red!"
63',action,STAT: Only one of Burnley's 26 points this season has been secured away from Turf Moor. They have the worst away record in the Premier League this season (D1 L8).
61',action,"Burnley need to mount a response, and they need to do so in a hurry. They've scored just three times away from home all season, so it's a bit of a daunting task they're faced with here."
59',assist,"Assist Mesut Özil ; Another assist on the season for Ozil, who admirably picked out the head of Mustafi with that delivery."
59',goal,"Goal Shkodran Mustafi ; ARSENAL HAVE THEIR BREAKTHROUGH! For all the quality attacking players the Gunners have out on the pitch, it's Mustafi who breaks the deadlock! It's a first Arsenal goal for the centre-half, who guides a perfect header in at the far post on the end of Ozil's corner."
58',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Matthew Lowton ; Lowton threw Sanchez down off the ball as Arsenal broke there, and that will earn him a clear yellow card."
58',action,"Xhaka does well to win the ball high up the pitch and start Arsenal forward, before laying off for Iwobi. The winger takes matters into his own hands, producing a delicious nutmeg to help him into the area, but he can't get a shot through as Lowton blocks behind!"
56',action,"PENALTY APPEALS DENIED! Referee Jonathan Moss didn't look at all interested in that, which is a real surprise considering the hasty nature of that challenge from Gray, who quite clearly took the feet of Mustafi out from under him! The centre-half was running away from goal, so it was entirely unnecessary from Gray, but that really looked a clear penalty, a sentiment which is confirmed by the replay."
54',action,STAT: For the 15th time a side has faced 14+ shots in the first half of a PL game this season. Six have been Burnley (including today).
52',action,"Arsenal's best moments in attack tonight have come when they've got the ball forward with urgency. Their slow, patient interplay has been incisive, but it's allowed Burnley to get bodies behind the ball, and when they do, there's just been no way through for the Gunners."
50',action,"FLASHED OVER! And just barely! Very similar to his chance in the first half, Sanchez takes a nice touch to cut in on his right. This time he opts for power, not placement, but his strike lifts narrowly over the bar!"
48',action,"Peter Cech (17) had more passes in the first half than any Burnley player. The Clarets player who came closest? Goalkeeper Tom Heaton. Common sense would indicate if this game continues on as such, it's only a matter of time for Arsenal, but this could also be one of those days where the keeper steals the show. It's on a knife-edge."
46',action,Back underway in north London!
,action,"Goalless at the break in London, but not for a lack of trying. Burnley started in the ascendency, but it's been all Arsenal since then, as they've sent 14 shots the way of Tom Heaton, who has been by far the busier of the two keepers. Still, for all the Gunners' efforts, the teams have evenly split six shots on target through 45 minutes as we await the breakthrough."
45'+1',action,HALF-TIME: ARSENAL 0-0 BURNLEY.
45',action,"This one looked worse live than on the replay, but Cech did take the brunt of a coming together with Gray there. It looked initially like the striker's knee plowed into the face of the Arsenal keeper, but upon further review, Cech's arm blocked the brunt of the blow - a scary moment either way, but it could have been much worse."
43',action,"THAT WAS MARKED FOR GOAL! Not entirely sure how Sanchez has missed here! The ball falls kindly for him following a corner. His first touch brilliantly takes him past Boyd, before using the second to open up the angle, but he curls his final attempt agonisingly wide of the far post! It wasn't an easy chance by any means, but you just expected the back of the net to ripple when he let that go."
41',action,"Sanchez uses the run of Giroud to his left to open up space for a shot, but he can't get the required power behind his effort as Heaton is able to dive across to his near post to make the save. It's not a bad idea, though, from the Chilean. With the sort of form Heaton is in, you can't afford to pass up a shooting chance."
39',action,"STAT: Arsenal have won six of their last seven meetings with Burnley in all competitions (D1), since a 0-2 loss in the League Cup in December 2008."
37',action,"Ozil cleverly brings the ball down in the area and pokes it by the last defender to run through on goal, but Heaton reads it the whole way as he flies off his line to intervene, before collecting his own punch just ahead of Sanchez's arrival!"
35',action,"The match is being played almost entirely in the Burnley half, but Arsenal need a bit more impetus in their approach play. They've switched to more of a patient build, which is allowing Burnley to keep organised and avoid having to really scramble at the back."
33',action,"Giroud is worse for wear following a hard challenge from Mee. That was an incredibly physical slide from the centre-half, but also a perfectly fair one. The Burnley fans certainly appreciated that, and Giroud is able to get up under his own power and walk it off, so no harm, no foul."
31',action,"AWAY BY MEE! Important, no-nonsense clearance there from the centre-half, following a patient but inquisitive build from Arsenal in attack. The pressure stays on following a corner and Ramsey boastfully plays in a rabona cross that just fails to reach Giroud."
29',action,STAT: Only Raheem Sterling (156) has had more touches in the opposition box this season than Alexis Sanchez (155). Burnley's top player in this regard is Sam Vokes (57).
27',action,"OFFSIDE! Ozil is flagged as he just narrowly mistimed his run, but that should take absolutely nothing away from the quality of that delivery by Sanchez, who placed a peach of a ball over the top, dropping it right at the feet of the German playmaker, who never had to break stride."
25',action,"Referee Jonathan Moss is forced to bring the game to a temporary halt, after Xhaka takes exception to a foul from Defour. The two go face-to-face, before Barnes comes in to his team-mate's defence, before directing his attention to the referee, after being denied a free-kick he feels he deserved a few short moments ago."
23',action,"That has to be better from Ozil! Good interplay in and around the penalty area from Arsenal, leads to a Gabriel cross from the right. The initial delivery is cleared, but only as far as Ozil, who has a clear lane for a shot, but scuffs his first-time effort wide of the far post."
21',action,"Gray is smothered and dispossessed before Arsenal break the other way, with Monreal sprung into space. He pulls back a decent ball for Giroud, but the striker gets under it, slicing an effort miles over the bar from 15 yard.s"
19',action,"STAT: Burnley have had 13 different goalscorers this season, a joint-league high with Manchester City, yet only three of those players have scored away goals (Ben Mee, Ashley Barnes and Sam Vokes all have one away goal each)."
17',action,"Real end-to-end stuff here at the Emirates! Barnes does well to make himself available up top, and plucks the ball out of his feet appropriately before testing Cech with a long-range strike, which is parried behind for a corner."
15',action,"LOVELY STOP! Impressive reactions from Heaton to dive across and parry Ozil's searching effort from the edge of the area, and he had to react late there with the threat of Giroud getting a touch on the way through. Pressure stays on and Iwobi misses the far post by inches, before Koscielny sends a header straight at Heaton."
13',action,"SAFE HANDS! Good response, that, from Burnley! They certainly aren't lacking confidence when they get in possession. Lowton drives forward on the break and drills in a low, diagonal cross towards the near post which Barnes attacks, but Cech is off his line to collect in the nick of time!"
11',action,"Possession residing solely with the hosts over the last five minutes, as the Gunners continue to grow in stature. There's a good width about them in attack, with Iwobi and Sanchez combining well with the two full-backs, though they have yet to test Heaton."
9',action,"STAT: Olivier Giroud has scored in each of his last four Premier League games for the Gunners, his best run since April 2015 (six matches)."
7',action,"NEARLY THERE! After a rather innocent spell in possession, Arsenal carry the ball up the pitch with real purpose. Sanchez is sprung down the left and lifts in an invitingly flat delivery, which Giroud flicks on towards the far post. Ward arrives to acrobatically head clear, however, otherwise it would have fallen perfectly for Iwobi at the far post!"
5',action,"Arsenal have spent much of these opening five minutes pinned back in their end here. It's been an altogether lethargic start from the Gunners, who need to get their footing under them sooner than later, or Chelsea's perfect weekend will continue."
3',action,"Well contrary to expectation, it's Burnley who start in the ascendency. They win a pair of free-kicks, both of which are lofted in the general direction of the light-blue shirts crowding the Arsenal penalty area, but the hosts are able to snuff out the threat on each occasion."
1',action,"AND THEY'RE OFF! Burnley get us underway, attacking right to left, on this beautifully sunny Sunday afternoon in London."
,action,"Sean Dyche has named an unchanged side to the one which he trotted out in the 1-0 victory over Southampton last weekend, after rotating much of his squad in their midweek FA Cup success over Sunderland."
,action,"So, Giroud starts in attack for an unchanged Arsenal team, the France striker looking to net for a sixth straight game. Bellerin, Coquelin and Welbeck are all among the substitutes. Burnley start with Gray and Barnes in attack. Barton is on the bench despite scoring the winner against Southampton last weekend."
,action,"BURNLEY TEAM (4-4-2): Heaton, Lowton, Keane, Mee, Ward; Boyd, Marney, Hendrick, Defour; Gray, Barnes."
,action,"ARSENAL TEAM (4-2-3-1): Cech, Gabriel, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Xhaka, Ramsey; Iwobi, Ozil, Sanchez; Giroud."
,action,"STATS: Burnley have lost their last five visits to Arsenal in all competitions, since a 1-0 league win in September 1974, while Gunners forward Alexis Sanchez has scored three and assisted another in his two appearances in this fixture."
,action,"Burnley, meanwhile, sit 12th, but could rise as high as ninth if they can pull off an upset at Emirates Stadium."
,action,Manchester City's draw with Tottenham and Liverpool's defeat to Swansea City have opened the door to Arsenal. They could move up to second with victory today.
