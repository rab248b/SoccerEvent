,action,"It wasn't the best of performances from Barcelona, but, overall, they just about deserved to win that. They started nervously and were second best for most of the first half, but they slowly but surely grew into the game and by the end were the better of the two. Atletico struggled to create chances as the afternoon wore on and allowed the contest to become more stretched, allowing Neymar, Suarez and Messi to find an increasing amount of space in front of goal. In the end, it would prove to be their downfall."
,action,FULL-TIME: ATLETICO MADRID 1-2 BARCELONA
90'+4',action,"Atletico lose out in the middle of the pitch, and this time it's Neymar who breaks forward. The Brazilian does well to get himself into a promising position before, unsurprisingly, holding up the ball to win his side a throw-in. That should be that."
90'+3',action,"A half-hearted Atletico attacking move breaks down and allows Rakitic to fly forward. He charges down the right wing on an impressive run before trying to take on Gabi, but the midfielder comes out on top before spinning and kick-starting another late attack."
90'+1',action,"Almost a late chance for Atletico! A long throw-in from the right flank bounces into the penalty area and almost reaches Torres, but just as the striker is about to unleash a close-range half-volley, Pique is just about able to scoop the ball away with a vital clearance."

86',goal,"Goal Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini ; GOAL! Messi has scored what could be the winner! A Barcelona free-kick is fired into the penalty area and bounces around dangerously. Umtiti brings the ball down well before teeing up Suarez, who then cuts the ball back to Messi. The Argentine's first-time shot is initially well blocked by Savic before rolling back to Messi, who then pokes the ball past Oblak and into the back of the net."
85',substitution,"; Barcelona have made a late substitution, with Roberto making way for Andre Gomes."
84',action,"A poor pass from Rafinha almost causes problems for Digne, who is immediately put under pressure by a group of Atletico players, but the Frenchman does well to evade all of them before powering forward and winning Barcelona a free-kick 40 yards away from goal."
82',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini ; Neymar charges into the left-hand side of the Atletico box and then takes on Vrsaljko, but the Croatian gets in front of the Brazilian before being pushed from behind. Messi isn't happy with the decision to award the home side a free-kick and is shown a yellow card as a result."

79',action,"Neymar picks up possession in the middle of the pitch and immediately bursts forward, but he's barged off the ball by Vrsaljko and wins Barcelona a free-kick in a promising position. It's curled into the middle of the penalty area by Messi but is easily dealt with by the Atletico defenders."
77',substitution,; Mathieu gingerly hobbles off the pitch to be replaced by Lucas Digne.
76',action,"Things don't look good for Mathieu, who is trying to run off the injury sustained from the Correa challenge but really seems to be struggling. He's gone down off the ball again and it looks as if his game is over."

70',goal,"Goal Diego Roberto Godín Leal ; GOAL! Atletico have equalised! Busquets gives away a needless free-kick over on the left wing, allowing Atletico to swing a cross into the Barcelona box. That's exactly what they do, as Koke curls a lovely ball right on to the head of Godin, who then beats Ter Stegen with a glancing header."
68',substitution,"; Atletico have made their first change of the game, and it's an attacking one, with Carrasco making way for Fernando Torres."
67',action,"Barcelona break forward as they quickly try to find a way through the Atletico back line once again, but Neymar ends up clashing with Vrsaljko as the two battle for the ball in the air and the Brazilian ends up catching the defender in the face with a flailing arm."
65',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Stefan Savić ; Savic is shown a yellow card in the aftermath of the goal, presumably for dissent after exchanging a few angry words with Neymar."
64',assist,"Assist Luis Alberto Suárez Díaz ; Suarez did well to out-muscle Godin to tee up Rafinha, but the Atletico defence should have done better. Godin wasn't strong enough whilst Gabi took his eye off Rafinha as he broke forward."
64',goal,"Goal Rafael Alcântara do Nascimento ; GOAL! Barcelona have taken the lead! The ball pinballs around the Atletico box as the home side struggle to deal with the danger. It eventually falls to Suarez, who spins past Godin before shooting, and his effort then rolls over to Rafinha to slot past Oblak to put Barcelona in front."

49',action,"Big miss by Suarez! Neymar dances down the left wing before finding Messi, who then tees up Suarez. The Uruguayan skips past Luis far too easily and takes on Oblak, but he pokes his close-range strike well wide of the far post. He really should have buried that!"
48',action,"Slightly clumsy defending from the Barcelona midfielders allows Gameiro to break into the right-hand side of the visitors' penalty area, but the Frenchman is unable to get the better of Pique and quickly loses out to the defender."

,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"At the other end, the Barcelona front line has been surprisingly quiet, but Neymar and, in particular, Suarez started to come into the game as the half progressed. The former has been one of their most dangerous players when pushing forward, whilst the latter went close to opening the scoring only to have his goal ruled out for a deliberate handball in the build-up."
,action,"Barcelona ended the opening period on top, but the opening half an hour was impressively dominated by Atletico, who arguably should have scored. The home side took advantage of some suspect defending to carve out a handful of good chances, but, despite their best efforts, they were unable to find a way past Ter Stegen, who has impressed in the Barcelona goal."
,action,HALF-TIME: ATLETICO MADRID 0-0 BARCELONA
45',action,"Barcelona continue to dominate possession as they try to take advantage of Atletico's decision to start sitting slightly deeper, but they're unable to find a way through the sea of red and white shirts before the referee's whistle brings an end to the first half."
43',action,"What a chance for Pique! Barcelona keep putting pressure on the home side as they continue to find a way back into the game after a poor start.

41',action,"Rafinha is dispossessed far too easily midway inside the Atletico half of the pitch and gifts the home side with a chance to counter-attack quickly, but Pique is there to out-muscle Gameiro and deny the Frenchman a way past the halfway line."
39',action,"The resulting corner fails to find a Barcelona player in front of goal, but the Atletico defence are only able to clear the ball as far as Umtiti. The centre-back takes a quick touch before shooting, but, off balance, he sends it comfortably over the top of the crossbar."
38',action,"Lovely save by Oblak! Messi steps up and curls a wonderful strike towards goal, but Oblak pulls off a brilliant diving stop to push the effort over the top of the crossbar."
37',action,"Suarez battles with Savic just outside of the Atletico penalty area as the two try to reach a looping ball forward, and it's the Uruguayan who comes out on top after being fouled by the centre-back, resulting in a free-kick for Barcelona in an incredibly dangerous position."
35',action,"Chance for Suarez! The game has started to open up, and this time it's Barcelona who counter swiftly. Suarez flies down the left wing on a great run before cutting inside and shooting, but his thumping strike is sent a few yards over the top of the crossbar."
34',action,"Another great stop by Ter Stegen! The Barcelona back line are carved open once again as Griezmann charges into the left-hand side of the penalty area. He then tries to poke a pass across the face of goal and into the feet of Koke, but, once again, Ter Stegen is there to deny Atletico the opening goal of the game."
33',action,"Vital interception by Ter Stegen! A looping cross is fired over to the far post and finds Carrasco in a pocket of space. The Belgian rises high and does well to meet the ball before nodding it down towards Koke, but Ter Stegen is there to dive in front of the ball at the last possible moment."
32',action,"The corner pinballs around the penalty area dangerously before falling to Carrasco on the edge of the box. The Belgian is unable to whip a cross back in and instead tees up Gabi, whose cross-field pass is overhit and sails out for a goal-kick."
31',action,"A high boot is raised and catches Griezmann, resulting in a free-kick for Atletico over on the left wing. It's initially sent short before Koke curls a cross into the heart of the Barcelona box, and Ter Stegen is just about able to get a fist on the ball to punch it out for a corner over on the right flank."
30',action,"Suarez scores, but it's ruled out! Neymar, who has been Barcelona's most dangerous player, sprints into the left-hand side of the penalty area before teeing up Messi. He quickly shoots but has his effort tipped into the path of Suarez by Jan Oblak, but the Uruguayan is penalised for a handball as he battles with both Oblak and Luis before nodding the ball into the back of the net from close range."
28',action,"It initially looks as if Neymar is going to be able to hit Atletico on a dangerous counter-attack over on the left flank, but he's unable to get the better of Savic and it's the home side who counter quickly. They break forward immediately before a clever through-ball is slotted into the path of Gameiro, but the Frenchman's run is slightly mistimed and the linesman's flag is raised as a result."
27',action,"Fantastic strike by Griezmann! The Frenchman weaves his way through the middle of the pitch before being left in far too much space just outside of the Barcelona box. He takes a quick look before firing a thumping strike towards the top right-hand corner of the net, but Ter Stegen gets a strong hand on the effort to tip it over the top of the crossbar."
26',action,"Atletico lose the ball in the middle of the pitch and gift possession to Neymar, who then quickly breaks forward. He sprints into the hosts' half of the pitch and towards the penalty area, but his final touch is poor and allows Savic to easily thump the ball back up the pitch."
24',action,"Another clumsy foul results in a free-kick for Atletico on the halfway line. It's thumped up to the Barcelona box and finds the head of Godin, but the defender is unable to pick out a team-mate and Sergio Busquets is eventually able to dribble his way out of trouble."
22',action,"Barcelona try to push into the Atletico half of the pitch as they attempt to alleviate the pressure being put on them, but they're unable to do so and concede a free-kick on the halfway line. It's fired forward and into the path of Vrsaljko, but it's slightly overhit and Jeremy Mathieu is easily able to shepherd it out for a goal-kick."
20',action,"Carrasco shows lovely footwork as he weaves his way into the left-hand side of the penalty area and towards the near post, but he's put under pressure and has to settle for a corner. The set-piece is just about dealt with by the visitors before Carrasco tries to fly forward once again, but he's too heavy-handed in his handling of Rafinha and concedes a free-kick."
18',action,"Felipe Luis skips past his marker deep down the left flank before curling a cross towards Koke at the near post. The midfielder rises high and almost manages to get a head on the ball, but Sergi Roberto is just about able to beat him to it at the vital moment."
17',action,"Another good opportunity for Atletico! This time, a dangerous a cross into the Barcelona penalty area should be easily cleared by Samuel Umtiti, but the defender nods the ball down to Griezmann. The striker takes a quick touch before unleashing a low shot towards the near post, but Umtiti sticks out a foot to stop the effort from sneaking into the back of the net."
16',action,"Chance for Gabi! Atletico quickly come back once again as they try to put more pressure on the Barcelona back line. A chipped cross into the penalty area finds Gameiro, who quickly volleys the ball back to Gabi, but the midfielder's shot from the edge of the box is fired straight into the hands of Marc-Andre ter Stegen."
15',action,"After a lengthy period on the back, Atletico pick up possession and immediately blast the ball up towards Gameiro. The striker flies into the Barcelona box as he tries to latch on to the pass, but Gerard Pique does well to out-muscle his opponent."
14',action,"Neymar makes a great run down the left wing as he dances his way into the Atletico half of the pitch. He does well to skip past two defenders before poking a low cross into the penalty area, but there's noody there to meet it and Stefan Savic is able to thump the ball away."
12',action,"As expected, Barcelona have enjoyed the majority of possession so far but have struggled to do much with it. Their attempted attacking moves have been slightly too slow, allowing Atletico to get plenty of bodies behind the ball to snuff out the danger."
10',action,"Sime Vrsaljko and Neymar have a slight coming together as they both try to pick up possession over on the right wing. The Croatian seems to come out on top as he attempts to keep the Brazilian at bay whilst lying on the floor, but, despite the pleas from the Atletico fans, Barcelona are eventually awarded a throw-in once the ball rolls out of play."
8',action,"Atletico are caught in possession just outside of their own penalty area, allowing Barcelona to quickly hit them on a counter-attack. Suarez does well to muscle his way forward before teeing up Messi, who fires a thumping strike from 25 yards out that narrowly misses hitting the target."
6',action,"Luis Suarez tangles with Godin as the two battle for the ball deep down the right wing, and Barcelona are awarded a free-kick in a dangerous position. It's poorly hit by Lionel Messi, however, and the ball safely sails out of play for a goal-kick before it can find a green shirt in front of goal."
4',action,"Diego Godin goes close! Atletico win themselves a corner over on the right wing, and it's swung into a dangerous position in the heart of the penalty area. Barcelona are unable to clear the danger and allow the ball to fall to Godin, who immediately unleashes a half-volleyed shot that flies just over the top of the crossbar."
3',action,"Early chance for Yannick Carrasco! Barcelona patiently pass the ball around on the halfway line before losing out to Antoine Griezmann. The Frenchman bursts forward and tees up Kevin Gameiro, who then spins and picks out Saul. The midfielder curls a lovely cross over to the far post and into the path of Carrasco, but he's unable to make decent contact with the ball and sends it spinning away from goal."
1',action,"We're off! Atletico get us underway, attacking from right to left."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."

,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"Meetings between the two sides have always been close and nervy affairs, despite Barcelona enjoying the vast majority of victories in recent years. Luis Enrique’s men most recently knocked out Atletico in the semi-final of the Copa del Rey at the start of the month, whilst they have lost this fixture just once in the previous twelve meetings."
,action,"A victory will move Atletico, who currently sit in fourth place, to within three points of Barcelona, but they will also currently be looking nervously over their shoulders. The gap between Los Rojiblancos and Real Sociedad is just one point after the fifth-place side beat Las Palmas, whilst Villarreal, who are in action against Real Madrid tonight, could also end up causing Atletico a few problems over the coming weeks."
,action,"As for Atletico, an underwhelming start to 2017 has turned into a good run for the club from the capital, who have won each of their last three games after being held to frustrating draws by Athletic Club and Deportivo Alaves. They also find themselves in a commanding position on the European stage thanks to Tuesday’s 4-2 win away to Bayer Leverkusen, meaning that, unlike their opponents, they have a good chance of reaching the quarter-finals of the competition."
,action,"Despite their recent struggles, a win for Barcelona will temporarily send them top of the table, albeit as a result of them having played one game more than Real Madrid. The current leaders stumbled in their last outing and suffered a disappointing loss to Valencia (only their second in the league all season) to make sure that the race for the title is in full swing once again."
,action,"All is not well in the Barcelona camp at the moment. As good as eliminated from the Champions League after a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain, they only just managed to beat Leganes in their last league game thanks to a late Lionel Messi penalty. As a result, they currently sit in third place heading into this afternoon’s big game, one point behind an ascendant Sevilla."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s La Liga game between Atletico Madrid and Barcelona at the Estadio Vicente Calderon.
