,action,"Full-time in this Bundesliga encounter. Dortmund, very fortuitously, earn a point away from home with a 1-1 draw away to Cologne, who will be very unhappy at having failed to claim all three points. Rudnevs gave the hosts the lead in the first half and it looked all the way like they would go on to win, but Reus had other ideas for Tuchel's outfit and eventually saved a point with a late equaliser. Thanks for joining us, see you next time."
90'+4',yellow-red,Yellow/Red Salih Özcan ; Second booking and subsequent red card for Ozcan following a tackle on Dembele.
90'+2',action,"FOUR minutes of added time have been allocated by the referee and if anyone is going to go on to win this now, it looks like Dortmund. Quite incredible to contemplate the visitors gaining all three points having played so poorly, but the ascendancy is certainly with them with two minutes to go!"
90',assist,Assist Gustavo Adrián Ramos Vásquez ; Superb work from Ramos as he sets up the equaliser.
90',goal,Goal Marco Reus ; GOOOOOAAAALLL! GOOOAAALLL FOR DORTMUND! A late equaliser for Tuchel's men! Adrian Ramos powers his way past the defender down the right channel before making it to the byline and reverses an absolutely perfect pass back into the centre of the box. Reus is on hand to send a lovely finish low into the bottom corner! One-one. GAME ON.
88',action,An excellent bit of work from Guirassy only moments after coming on as he displays an impressive bit of strength to hold off a few challenges before eventually earning the free-kick out of Bartra. That was vital to take the pressure off his defenders are Dortmund were beginning to look a bit dangerous.
86',substitution,"; Another change from Cologne as their other starting centre-forward makes his way towards the bench. Modeste's replacement, this time like-for-like up top, is 20-year-old Sehrou Guirassy."
84',action,"This has been a very tired performance from Dortmund so far. When you think about it you can't really blame them as Die Borussen put in a hell of amount of effort to claw themselves back to 2-2 in the match against Real Madrid on Wednesday evening, but that doesn't really excuse how bad this performance has been."
82',action,"Schmelzer drives down the left wing and picks out a deep cross to the back post for Ramos, who in turn attempts to recycle possession back into the danger area for Aubameyang to turn home. However, the header from the substitute is easily collected by Kessler between the sticks for Cologne."
80',action,"Ten minutes to go and it looks like this is going to be attack versus defence with Dortmund pushing forward for the equaliser. Even if this is indeed the case, you wouldn't fancy the visitors to find the back of the net in another 100 minutes with the way they are playing at the moment."
78',action,"Things are getting a bit desperate for Dortmund now as they are appealing for anything and everything in and around the penalty box. Aubameyang meets a high ball with a lovely chested touch inside the area, looking to set up Ramos for a strike on goal, only for Heintz to intercept with what looks like handball. The referee waves play on!"
76',substitution,"; Stoger follows suit and makes a change of his own, and it much the opposite fashion from Tuchel. As the hosts have the lead, a striker is coming off for a defender as Konstantin Rausch replaces Artoms Rudnevs. Cologne looking to see this one out and shut up shop."
74',substitution,"; Last throw of the dice from Tuchel as he makes his third and final change. Leaving the action for Dortmund is Sokratis and he will be replaced by Adrian Ramos, so a defender off for a centre-forward, then. Positive alteration."
72',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Marco Höger ; It is raining yellow cards in Cologne! The next player to see his name go into the book is Hoger as the former Schalke man completely takes out Sokratis down the right-hand side, who stays down, seemingly needing some treatment from the physio. Poor tackle, that."
70',action,"Twenty minutes to go at the RheinEnergieStadion and at the moment, Cologne are on course to overtake Dortmund in the Bundesliga table should they see out this narrow victory. Following a dreadful first half, you would have expected the visitors to be much better in the next 45, but they have actually been worse."
68',action,"It is tough to determine whether Dortmund have been that bad going forward or Cologne have been that good in their defensive duties. Either way, this will be worrying for Thomas Tuchel who will seldom see his star players perform so poorly this season."
66',action,"Again, Dortmund give the ball away cheaply in the final third only this time Cologne are equipped to burst free with a four-versus-two counterattack. Osako leads the charge with a galloping run down the left channel, but it is a desperately poor end to the move as the subsequent pass into the box is easily collected by Weidenfeller. That was awful!"
64',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Salih Özcan ; The yellow cards are coming thick and fast in this Bundesliga clash now and the latest guilty party is Ozcan, who halts a promising-looking Dortmund attack by scything down Rode. Another free-kick which Reus will take."
62',action,"Reus whips another corner-kick into the Cologne penalty box and it is Sorensen who manages to clear with a commanding headrer. Durm, who is lingering outside of the area at the set-piece, meets the ball in the air with an attempted volley, but it would have took something pretty spectacular to score from that distance which makes it no surprise to see a fan collect in row Z."
60',yellow-card,Yellow Card Sokratis Papastathopoulos ; That counter is stopped as Sokratis brings down Rudnevs with a cynical shove to see yellow.
59',action,"Rode opens up his stride to burst down the left wing and hit the byline before standing a teasing cross at the back post. Ginter collects but only manages to send a speculative, lofted cross back across the penalty area which is easily cleared by Cologne, who now can spring free for a counter."
57',action,"Strangely, the cohesion just doesn't seem to be there among the Dortmund strikers at the moment. Within just a couple of minutes, promising openings have came and gone thanks to either a miscommunication with a run or a poorly executed pass."
55',action,"The ball falls fortuitously for Rudnevs inside the box and the opening goalscorer goes for the attempt on target, only to not quite catch it right. Luckily for him, he still manages to get something positive out of the missed chance as the shot cannons off Bartra before going behind for a Cologne corner."
53',yellow-card,Yellow Card Dominique Heintz ; Heintz sees yellow for tripping up Dembele.
53',substitution,; Early second-half change from Tuchel as Sebastian Rode comes on for Castro.
52',action,"Not the best couple of minutes for Modeste as moments after passing up a hge opportunity for the second, he goes down very weakly down the left looking for the free-kick after a tackle from Bartra. As the referee waves play on, the striker is forced to sheepishly get back to his feet."
50',action,"AN ABSOLUTE SITTER FROM MODESTE! Cologne catch Dortmund out with a speedy counter and the Frenchman leads the charge with a marauding run down the right wing before rounding the oncoming Weidenfeller. However, he can't get the strike on target and instead can only find the side-netting! Huge let-off for Die Borussen."
48',action,"Reus evades the challenges of two Cologne defenders to cut inside on his right foot before firing a pass into the feet of Dembele. The latter steps into a more deeper area but eventually makes the wrong decision with his pass, opting to attempt a difficult pass over the opposition defence rather than playing square to Ginter, who is free. Poor."
46',action,We are back under way in this engrossing Bundesliga clash!
,action,"Half-time as the referee adds no stoppage time. Cologne are on course to continue their excellent recent run against Dortmund as they lead Tuchel's men 1-0 at the break following a lovely glancing header from Rudnevs, which came against the run of play. The visitors need to sort themselves out if they are to get anything out of this. Second period to come."
45'+1',yellow-card,Yellow Card Ousmane Dembélé ; Dembele sees yellow for dissent.
43',action,"A small break in play at the moment as Hoger and Weigl are both down in the centre of the pitch after a pretty nasty collision. There wasn't any intent to harm in either challenge from the players, but they will both require a moment or two to recover as it was a hell of a knock. They'll be fine."
41',action,"Die Borussen have enjoyed a plethora of free-kick opportunites in the opposition half in the opening 40 minutes or so but they have been rather disappointing so far. Reus has been the most guilty party as for the most part, the crosses have been either too flat or indeed too deep!"
39',action,"Some signs of frustration creeping in for Dortmund at the moment. On this occasion, a lovely delivery is sent deep to the back post from a free-kick but Cologne are let off the hook after Sokratis is penalised for pushing and pulling away at Sorensen during the aerial battle. The Greek international gives the referee an earful for the decision."
37',action,"Dortmund are put under pressure at the back as they find it difficult to get the ball on the deck, with possession being throw up into the air after a variety of headed clearances. Eventually, Sokratis calms things down before sending a pass down the left for Schmelzer, who earns the foul out of Hoger."
35',action,"Reus picks himself up to take the free-kick following the Osako foul, but Hector is on hand to make the vital interception at the front post to clear for the hosts."
34',action,"Cologne took the lead thanks to a brilliant delivery from a Hector free-kick. Now, however, they will be forced to defend a cross from a similar position as Osako concedes the needless foul on Reus just a few yards in from the touchline."
32',action,"Away from home in the Bundesliga, Dortmund just seem to lack the killer instinct which is usually so prominent in matches at the Westfalenstadion. Cologne are superb at home, too, so Tuchel's men will certainly need to work extremely hard if they are to claw a result out of this one."
30',action,"Well, Dortmund will be wondering just how they find themselves behind at the moment as they have pretty much dominated possession from the get-go. They can take some heart from the fact that they did come back from behind twice during the week against European Champions, Real Madrid. This is by no means over."
28',assist,Assist Jonas Hector ; Excellent assist from Hector with the free-kick delivery.
28',goal,"Goal Artoms Rudņevs ; GOOOOAAAALLLL! GOOOAAALLL FOR COLOGNE! The hosts take the lead, and against the run of play! Hector stands over a free-kick just inside the Dortmund half and steps up to curl a teasing cross into the box which is met by Rudnevs, who glances a terrific header home into the corner! One-nil."
28',yellow-card,Yellow Card Marcel Schmelzer ; First booking of the match goes to Schmelzer.
27',substitution,"; Unfortunately for Tuchel and Dortmund, the visitors are being forced into their opening change early on here. Piszczek has picked up an injury and will have to come off to be replaced by Marc Bartra."
25',action,"Both sides are surrendering possession a little too much at the moment, with dodgy passes being exchanged on far too a regular basis for any kind of substantial attacks to be generated going forward. Still plenty of time for the creative players to find their feet, though."
23',action,"After a small delay following a foul from Sorensen, Reus steps up to take a free-kick from a decent position around 30 yards out. However, the former Gladbach man fails to test the goalkeeper with a strike that goes over the wall but ends up flashing beyond the wrong side of the post."
21',action,"Unfortunately for both sides, most of the decent play has came in the middle of the park rather than in more dangerous areas. Neither Weidenfeller or Kessler has really had a save to make which is surprising when taking into consideration the attacking talent on show."
19',action,"Reus makes a smart run into the penalty box and turns sharply with his back to goal before passing into the feet of Dembele. The Dortmund youngster switches the ball on to his other foot before attempting a speculative strike aimed towards the top left corner, but it is never bothering the goalkeeper between the sticks."
17',action,"There is just a little bit of a lull in proceedings at the moment after that blistering start in the opening five minutes or so. Within just the few moments of play, both sides should actually have found the back of the net, but Ozcan and Castro both passed up great opportunities by firing over the bar."
15',action,"Reus receives the ball to feet down the left-hand side and uses the overlapping run of Schmelzer to cut inside into space before attempting a lashed pass in behind the Cologne defence for Aubameyang, but there is just a little too much put on it and even the speed demon that is the Dortmund striker can't get on the end of it."
13',action,Dortmund are enjoying a nice period of sustained possession at the moment but it is coming without too much penetration into the Cologne penalty box. We are yet to see anything substantial from the likes of Reus and Dembele.
11',action,"There has been a really nice, high-tempo start to proceedings here in this Bundesliga clash and without jinxing anything, it appears like we could see a few goals as the afternoon progresses. Both sides have plenty of talent going forward, but questions continue to be raised over defensive solidity."
9',action,"GOOOOAAAAALLL FOR DORTMUND! WAIT! NO! OFFSIDE! Reus latches on to a pass down the left channel and makes his way into the penalty box before stabbing a pass across the danger area for Aubameyang. However, the Gabonese is correctly flagged as being off just as he taps home."
7',action,"Dortmund are coming off the back of an outstanding result away in the Santiago Bernabeu against Real Madrid which saw them top their Champions League group. However, defensive frailties were once again on show which makes it interesting to see them push so very high up the pitch with the backline basically up to the halfway line."
5',action,"Modeste is sure to be a thorn in the side of the Dortmund defence this afternoon. We see our first glimpse of the striker as an attacking threat as he goes on a marauding run down the left wing before cutting inside to thread a quite lovely pass in behind the backline of the visitors for Rudnevs. However, the latter is flagged as offside."
3',action,"OH WHAT A CHANCE FOR COLOGNE! Rudnevs initially does really well for the home side as he shakes off the attentions of his marker before hitting the byline and reversing a cross back into the danger area. Ozcan meets it, but can't keep his strike down and sends an attempt well over the bar!"
1',action,We are under way at the RheinEnergieStadion!

,action,TEAM NEWS...
,action,"The last fixture between Cologne and Dortmund ended with honours remaining even at full-time following an entertaining 2-2 draw. On that occasion at the Westfalenstadion in May, Gonzalo Castro, Marco Reus, Modeste, and Milos Jojic all got on the scoresheet for their respective outfits to see out the stalemate. Under the tutelage of Peter Stoger, Cologne are unbeaten against Dortmund and have took eight points from the last four fixtures against Die Borussen."
,action,"The Billy Goats have actually made an impressive start to the campaign in their own right and are just two points behind Dortmund in seventh. A win today, and they will certainly be staking a big claim for Europa League or even Champions League qualification. Their star player this season has been 12-goal striker, Anthony Modeste, who only has Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ahead of him in the goalscoring charts."
,action,"Thomas Tuchel's charges, as of yet, have not took full advantage of Bayern's stuttering start, though. The visitors this afternoon are currently down in sixth in the Bundesliga, but could potentially move into the Champions League places should they claim all three points here again Cologne."
,action,"In recent years, the top-flight in Germany has more or less been a one-team race with Bayern Munich typically bulldozing their way towards the title without much opposition. However, with the rise of unlikely table-toppers, RB Leizpig, the likes of Dortmund can gain confidence that they might be able to overcome Die Bayern to be crowned champions again."
,action,Good afternoon football fans! Welcome to LIVE coverage of the German Bundesliga encounter between Cologne and Borussia Dortmund from the RheinEnergieStadion.
