,action,"In the end, it was a comfortable and impressive afternoon for Arsenal, who never looked like losing against a Palace side that struggled at either end of the pitch. The visitors always looked second best at the back, whilst, at the other end, both Benteke and Campbell found little luck in front of goal due to their inability to create chances. The win moves Arsenal back up to third place, above Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City, whilst Palace remain dangerously near to the relegation zone ahead of their must-win game against Swansea City on Tuesday."

,action,"A defeat for 18th-place Sunderland yesterday gave Palace a boost and has presented them with an opportunity to climb up to 16th in the table, but that should be tricky for them to make a reality. Since returning to the top flight in 2013, they have taken just one point off Arsenal from a possible 18, with each of the other five games all ending in wins for the North London club."
,action,"Sam Allardyce’s return to management almost ended in a desperately needed victory against Watford in his first game in charge of Palace, but a second-half Troy Deeney penalty condemned them to a fourth game without a win. The Eagles now have just one victory from their last 12 league games, leaving them just two points outside of the relegation zone."
,action,"Despite suffering recent defeats, Arsenal have impressed at home and will be confident about their chances of extending that record here today. Only Liverpool have managed to beat the Gunners at home this season, with all of their previous three clashes ending in victories. They also boast a dominant record over Palace, who haven’t won away againt Arsenal since October 1994."
,action,"Groans of discontent have been heard from Arsenal fans in recent weeks after back-to-back defeats against Everton and Manchester City, but their team bounced back with a much-needed, albeit narrow, 1-0 win against a stubborn West Bromwich Albion side on Boxing Day. They currently sit 12 points behind Chelsea, however, meaning that another victory here today is imperative if they are to avoid falling too far behind the league leaders."
