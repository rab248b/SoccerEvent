,action,"FULL-TIME: SASSUOLO 0-1 MILAN. A highly controversial Carlos Bacca penalty sees the Rossoneri claim their first-ever points at the Mapei Stadium, with Domenico Berardi missing a penalty at the other end. Sassuolo will feel hard done by given the nature of the goal, but really they have only their keeper to thank for keeping it closer than it probably should have been in the end."
90'+5',action,"INCHES WIDE! Suso misses what looked a sure goal from 10 yards, just failing to place the ball in at the top corner, but it won't matter as it proves to be the final kick of the match!"
90'+3',yellow-card,Yellow Card Joseph Alfred Duncan ; Duncan is booked as Sassuolo desperately try and win the ball back.
90'+3',action,"Milan are seeing this out in style. This is a professional and accomplished display from the visitors in stoppage-time, keeping the ball high up the pitch as opposed to simply trying to pack the defence and hang on for dear life."
90'+1',action,There will be five minutes added on at the end of this match.
89',action,"Frustrations mount for Sassuolo as time winds off the clock here with Abate down and in need of attention. This doesn't appear to be anything serious for the full-back, despite the stretcher coming out - and the suspicions are realised as he comes back on the pitch as soon as play resumes."
87',substitution,"; Milan's last change, more to wind down the clock here than anything, brings Andrea Poli on for Sosa."
86',action,STAT: Sassuolo haven’t recorded a draw in their last six league fixtures (W4 L2) – their previous four wins had arrived over 18 games.
84',substitution,"; Sassuolo make their final change of the afternoon, one last roll of the dice for Eusebio Di Francesco, as Federico Ricci replaces Defrel."
82',action,"CONSIGLI AGAIN! Milan pressure stays on and it's Zapata who rises highest to get on the end of a corner, but his thumping header is impressively turned aside by Consigli! The Sassuolo keeper is doing everything in his power to keep the hosts within range here!"
80',action,"OUTSTANDING SAVE! That's a stop out of the top drawer from Consigli to deny Suso on the end of a delightful Milan counter. The visitors broke three against two, with Suso eventually presented with the ball in the box. He opened up and cut onto his left, and perhaps with a bit more on that shot Consigli wouldn't have been able to react to keep it out."
78',substitution,"; Sassuolo's second change of the match sees Antonio Ragusa enter the fray, with Politano replaced."
76',substitution,"; Milan make their second change of the afternoon, with Lucas Ocampos coming on to replace Bacca."
74',action,"FINE SAVE! Donnarumma hasn't been particularly busy today, but that's a smart save at a vital time from the teenager who manages to deny Berardi's deflected effort at full-stretch with a strong right hand!"
72',action,"BRIGHT START FROM MATRI! The substitute, only just on the pitch, is already making himself a nuisance. A clever turn sees him past a defender, but a heavy touch prevents the chance from coming to fruition, before a towering jump from a corner causes a bit of panic at the back for Milan."
70',substitution,; A first change of the day for Sassuolo sees striker Alessandro Matri replace midfielder Pellegrini.
69',action,"A hard shift is being put in by this midfield players today, for both teams. With the game so stretched throughout, there's been plenty of running put in by the midfield trios and you have to believe tired legs will be setting in sooner than later."
67',action,"The tempo is picking up again as we approach the final 20 minutes. Sassuolo recognise the need to push the pace, while Milan are looking to exploit the space being made available to them on the counter and find that elusive second goal that would put this game to bed."
65',substitution,"; Milan make the first change of the afternoon as Chelsea loanee Mario Pasalic replaces Kucka, who had something of a dire showing in this contest, missing a sitter and conceding a penalty."
62',action,STAT: AC Milan are one of two teams (along with Empoli) against which Sassuolo have a 100% record at home in Serie A amongst those met more than twice so far.
60',action,"A crazy few minutes funnels out to a more relaxed spell now. Bacca had the ball in the back of the net for a third time today, but for a second time he has it called back, this one for a foul. Back the other way come Sassuolo, who have another appeal for a penalty following a Zapata challenge, but this one is rightfully not given."
58',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Lorenzo Pellegrini ; Pellegrini goes into the book for a two-footed challenge on Vangioni, and he's a lucky boy as he should have probably been booked in the first half for a similar challenge, which would have seen him sent off here for a second yellow. Instead it's just his first, but he will be walking a tight line the rest of the way."
56',action,"Abate finds himself in all sorts of space on the overlap, with options plentiful in the centre to pick out a cross, but he's unable to do so! That had to be better from the full-back. Nonetheless, that should serve as a bit of encouragement for the visitors, who found plenty of space there on the counter."
54',action,"Sassuolo are on the front foot consistently now, taking the game to Milan as they hunt down an equaliser. The visitors are lacking a bit of sharpness as their focus seems to have waned since the interval."
52',action,"STAT: Sassuolo have won 12 points against AC Milan in Serie A, only against Genoa (13) do they boast a better record in the top-flight."
50',action,"PENALTY APPEALS DENIED! The referee certainly isn't making any friends here this afternoon. A giveaway at the back is pounced upon by Aquilani inside the Milan box. His clever backheel is blocked by the hand of Sosa, which sends Sassuolo into an all-out protest for a penalty, but they don't get the decision!"
48',action,"A surprisingly timid start to this second half at the Mapei Stadium. Neither side showed much hesitation in the first half, needing no invitation to attack, but they've come out of the break rather shy, almost."
46',action,Here we go again!
,action,"Carlos Bacca has Milan ahead at the interval, but it comes with more than a hint of controversy as his penalty, which was debatably a penalty in the first place, should have been retaken as he struck it off his standing foot, 10 minutes after Domenico Berardi missed a spot-kick at the other end."
45'+2',action,HALF-TIME: SASSUOLO 0-1 MILAN.
45',action,There will be two minutes added on at the end of this first half.
43',action,"What a wild and wacky first half this has been at the Mapei Stadium. The tempo has slowed a bit after an otherwise frenetic first 40 minutes, but the scene is set for what should be a wonderfully entertaining second half. It's been such an open game and there's no reason to believe it won't continue."
41',action,"BACCA BAGS A BRACE! Or does he?! The striker is off in celebration after tucking a neat header in at the near post, but he was offside! It took a while for the linesman to make the call, so long in fact that it looked like the goal would stand, but Milan's joy is short-lived, and rightfully so, in the end."
39',action,"Seconds after Bertolacci is booked, Pellegrini slides into a reckless challenge in the attacking half, but somehow escapes a booking! There's no real consistency here from the referee."
38',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Andrea Bertolacci ; Bertolacci goes into a challenge with his studs showing and that's a clear yellow, arguably the clearest of the half."
36',action,"Defrel has been starved of service up top. The Sassuolo striker is more than capable of holding the ball up, but the hosts are too slow to work the ball forward when they win it back, unable or unwilling to play it into his feet quickly enough to generate a good attack."
34',action,"It's growing a bit cagey as the fouls continue to pile up, with the ball being contained largely in midfield. Approaching the last 10 minutes of the first half and given the physicality of this match, it's entirely possible we see someone sent off before the interval."
32',action,"Sassuolo are in the ascendency here, keeping Milan hemmed back in their end, but they need to do more to challenge Donnarumma. There's a good intensity to the hosts, but the quality has been sporadic at best on the front foot."
30',yellow-card,"Yellow Card José Ernesto Sosa ; Milan see Sosa go into the book now for a challenge near the halfway line, as the referee starts to lose control over the match. At this rate we will not finish with 11 against 11."
28',action,"STAT: Sassuolo have the highest percentage of goals conceded in the opening 15 minutes of play (26%, 10 of 39) in Serie A this season."
26',yellow-card,Yellow Card Federico Peluso ; Peluso becomes the third Sassuolo played booked in the last five minutes. They'll have to be a bit more dilligent moving forward.
24',action,"The replays are clear as day, Bacca's penalty clearly struck off his other foot. It should not have counted! The penalty shouldn't have been awarded in the first place, and to compound frustrations for Sassuolo, the goal shouldn't have stood either."
23',yellow-card,Yellow Card Gregoire Defrel ; Politano is booked for dissent.
22',penalty-goal,"Penalty Goal Carlos Arturo Bacca Ahumada ; MILAN LEAD, CONTROVERSIALLY! As if the penalty decision wasn't questionable enough, Bacca slipped at the vital moment on the run up to his penalty and seemed to strike it off his other foot, which changed its course and was enough to beat Consigli! Sassuolo players protest furiously, but to no avail!"
21',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Alberto Aquilani ; PENALTY TO MILAN! Bertolacci goes down very easily in a bit of traffic inside the box and the referee emphatically points to the spot! Aquilani is the culprit, but that's a weak decision. Bertolacci has pulled the wool over the referee's eyes there."
20',action,"STAT: Sassuolo have lost the last two home games in the league, they are yet to lose three in a row since March 2014."
18',action,"STRAIGHT AT CONSIGLI! Vangioni tries to bend an effort towards the far post following a corner, but his effort is tame and central, making for an easy stop. Moments later Milan are back on the front foot, and Bertolacci nearly plays Bacca through, but Sassuolo's scrambled defence just manages to see it away."
16',action,"Milan looking increasingly threatening in attack as they up the urgency and push the tempo. There's really an excellent pace to this match as both sides are keen to get the ball forward as soon as they win it, which has made for some excellent viewing from a neutral perspective."
14',action,"STUNNING STRIKE! And an equally impressive stop by Consigli, who reacts superbly to get his hands up and parry Deulofeu's expertly struck volley over the bar!"
12',missed-penalty,Missed Penalty Domenico Berardi ; HE'S MISSED IT! Shocking miss! Berardi shoots to his right and misses the target by a couple of feet! Unbelievable!
11',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Juraj Kucka ; PENALTY GIVEN! Kucka with a shocking miss at one end and now he concedes a penalty at the other, dragging Duncan to ground after the Sassuolo midfielder simply outworked him to keep his run alive inside the area! That's clumsy from the Milan midfielder."
10',action,"STAT: Domenico Berardi, making his 100th Serie A appearance, has scored eight goals in the top flight against AC Milan, at least three more than versus any other side."
8',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Domenico Berardi ; And shortly after he produces a yellow card to Berardi for simulation - that really could have gone either way, but it does seem harsh on the attacker."
7',action,"NO LUCK FOR BERARDI! The striker at heart of everything at the moment! He pounces on a loose ball in attack and goes down in the area under a challenge from Vangioni. The home fans shout for a penalty, and there looks a good claim, but the referee awards a free-kick in Milan's favour for simulation!"
5',action,"HOW HAS THAT STAYED OUT?! The delivery comes in from Sosa and it's the perfect cross through the heart of the six-yard box. It arrives perfectly at the feet of Kucka, but somehow he can't divert it into an empty net from two yards out! That has to go down as one of the misses of the season!"
3',action,"FREE-KICK! No penalty says the referee, only a free-kick as he trips up Deulofeu an inch outside the box, right up against the byline. It's an incredibly loose challenge from the Sassuolo attacker, conceding an early chance to Milan."
1',action,"AND THEY'RE OFF! Sassuolo in green and black as they get the match underway, attacking left to right. Milan are in all white."
,action,"Vincenzo Montella makes two changes from the victory over Fiorentina. Cristian Zapata is restored in defence at the expense of Gustavo Gomez, while Mario Pasalic is replaced in midfield by Andrea Bertolacci. The attacking trident of Gerard Deulofeu, Suso and Carlos Bacca remains in-tact."
,action,"Eusebio Di Francesco makes just one change to his side from the victory over Udinese last weekend, with Gregoire Defrel coming in to lead the line at the expense of Alessandro Matri. Defrel will be supported by Matteo Politano and Domenico Berardi."
