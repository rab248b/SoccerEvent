36',goal,"Goal Gylfi Þór Sigurðsson.HE'S DONE IT! What a strike by Sigurdsson! A super free-kick fired into the top left-hand corner which left Hennessey with no chance. It was a poor free-kick for Puncheon to give away and Sigurdsson is always a threat when it comes to set pieces, and he has got his side back into the game with a fantastic strike."
36',action,"Two consecutive corners for Swansea come to nothing but then Cork wins a free-kick right on the edge of the box after a foul by Puncheon, giving away a needless free-kick. This is a great opportunity for Swansea and it is Sigurdsson who is going to take it..."

18',action,First corner of the game for Swansea! The defenders have come forward but once again anything in the air is being cleared by the Palace defence. The visitors certainly have a big advantage when it comes to aerial battles.
16',action,"Barrow once again causing problems down the right-hand side against Kelly, the Swansea man just has too much pace for the Palace defender to deal with, and the hosts are trying to exploit that."
14',action,"CHANCE SWANSEA! First real opportunity of the game for the Swans and Sigurdsson should've done better with his effort at goal.

Palace won a corner which was taken by Yohan Cabaye and met by Scott Dann, the ball then bounced around the Swansea box before it fell to Benteke just yards from goal, but he fires well over the bar from close range."
4',action,"It looks like Gylfi Sigurdsson is once again playing as the main striker for Swansea today, whilst Palace are set up in a 4-4-2 formation with Christian Benteke and Connor Wickham both up front but Wilfried Zaha and Jason Puncheon are constantly charging down wings."
