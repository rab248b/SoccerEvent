,action,"That's all for our live coverage, thanks for following along. Goodbye!"
,action,"Manolo Gabbiadini's first-half double provides Saints with their first away points of 2017, while leaving the Black Cats pinned to the bottom of the Premier League table. A Jason Denayer own-goal made it three late, before Shane Long added a fourth for good measure in stoppage-time, as Sunderland are humbled on their own patch."
90'+4',action,FULL-TIME: SUNDERLAND 0-4 SOUTHAMPTON.
90'+4',yellow-card,Yellow Card Wahbi Khazri ; A late booking for Khazri for dissent as Sunderland have a goal disallowed for offside.
90'+2',assist,Assist James Ward-Prowse ; Ward-Prowse picks up a deserving assist. He's been excellent today.
90'+2',goal,"Goal Shane Long ; STUNNING FINISH! That's a work of art from Shane Long, who brilliantly disguises his effort, poking a first-time finish in at the far post following the feed from Ward-Prowse. And it was Bertrand's delivery over the top to play the duo in..."
90'+1',action,"""We've got more fans than you"" is the chant from the Southampton supporters, who taunt the few remaining Sunderland supporters left in the building. Clever."
90',action,There will be three minutes added on at the end of this match.
88',own-goal,"Own Goal Jason Denayer ; POINTS SEALED! Three goals, three points for Saints and it comes on the end of some great interplay from the visitors. Bertrand is slipped through by Redmond and he drills a ball across the face of goal, which knocks off a helpless Denayer and into the back of the net!"
86',action,"Three corners for Sunderland over the last two minutes but it's really a case of too little to late for them. Southampton are consummate in dealing with each individual threat, as it doesn't look as though Sunderland have it in them to grab a goal and setup a tense finish at the Stadium of Light."
84',action,"Simply put, if Sunderland are going to stave off relegation this season, they have to be a whole lot better than they were today, and they need the Stadium of Light to be a much more daunting place to play. This is classic Wearside weather - cold, wet and windy - but the Black Cats never did look at home today, and these fans weren't into it either, many of whom have already filtered out of the stadium."
82',substitution,; A second change for Saints sees Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg replace Tadic.
81',substitution,"; Sunderland make their third change of the afternoon, with Wahbi Khazri replacing Gibson."
79',action,"MANNONE SAVES AGAIN! Shocking complacency from Sunderland who have switched off here in the final 20 minutes. It's Redmond who gets through on this occasion, but Mannone does well to get his hands up to deny the forward at the near post."
77',action,"STAT: Southampton are one of three Premier League sides yet to collect a point away from home in 2017, along with Burnley and Bournemouth."
75',action,"SMART SAVE! Long posing an immediate threat! The striker gets between Kone and Jones to latch onto the end of a cross, forcing Mannone into a fine reactionary stop to parry the header over the bar!"
73',substitution,"; Shane Long comes off the bench as Southampton make their first change of the night, with the hero Gabbiadini replaced. No hat-trick today for the Italian."
72',action,"EVEN CLOSER! Sunderland are getting picked apart at will, in danger of falling further behind. Ward-Prowse provides the threat again, getting on the end of a short cross from Romeu, heading inches wide of the far post!"
70',action,NOT FAR AWAY! Ward-Prowse unloads a venomous strike from 25 yards and misses the top corner by no more than a yard or so! He had Mannone at full-stretch there.
68',action,"This has been a completely assured and confident performance from Southampton at a time when they so desperately needed a result like this to right the ship. 2017 has been a torrid year for them thus far, but three points today should ensure they won't be dragged back into the relegation scrap, an unimaginable prospect a couple of months ago."
66',action,"Forster has his first save to make of the afternoon, coming just past the 65th minute, and it's about as comfortable as it gets for the keeper who barely has to move to collect Ndong's tame effort from 25 yards."
64',action,"Sunderland don't look capable of turning this around at the moment, nor have they provided much reason for optimism through the first hour, but they did require just a 15 minute surge to get past Crystal Palace last weekend, so they can't be completely written off just yet."
62',action,"STAT: Defoe’s two goals against Crystal Palace took him into second place in Sunderland’s all-time leading Premier League goalscorers with 33 goals, one ahead of Darren Bent on 32 – although he is 28 goals behind Kevin Phillips (61 goals)."
60',action,"Borini and Januzaj are flanking Defoe now, who will have plenty more support over the final 30 minutes. Pienaar is playing just in behind them. There's a bit more drive behind Sunderland now, though Southampton aren't appearing at all anxious in defence."
58',substitution,"; It's Larsson who gives way for Borini here, with Sunderland's second change."
56',action,"Southampton are in complete control of this match and Moyes has seen about enough. Defoe is hardly getting a touch on the ball, with little to no service to speak of, so here comes Fabio Borini, stripped and ready to go on the touchline. An all or nothing approach forthcoming for Sunderland, perhaps, depending on who gives way."
54',action,"CLEVER! Romeu meets a delightful free-kick from Tadic, heading it over to an unmarked Gabbiadini at the far post, but the flag goes up on Romeu, who just got behind the last defender before Tadic's delivery. Needless from the midfielder, that, as he had to come back onside to meet the cross anyhow."
52',action,STAT: Three of Sunderland’s last four Premier League goals against the Saints have been penalties (two from Jordi Gomez and one from Defoe).
50',action,Sunderland don't have the luxury of taking their time to get back into the match. They have to act and they have to do so now. This is more than just an uphill climb. Not once this season have they managed to claim a point from a match in which they trailed by two goals.
48',action,"ALMOST A THIRD! Sunderland make life difficult on themselves, failing to take charge in defending a corner. Jones' marking on Gabbiadini is tight, but not enough to prevent him from meeting the cross. The striker redirects an effort at goal, but it's straight at Mannone who makes a comfortable stop."
46',action,Here we go again!
46',substitution,"; A positive switch from Sunderland at the interval as Steven Pienaar replaces John O'Shea, which will see Sunderland into more of a 4-3-3."
,action,"A Manolo Gabbiadini double has Southampton comfortably ahead at the interval at the Stadium of Light. If there was any controversy as to whether or not the first one should have counted, the striker erased all doubt with his second, sending Sunderland into the locker room at half-time to a chorus of boos from the home supporters."
45'+1',action,HALF-TIME: SUNDERLAND 0-2 SOUTHAMPTON.
45',assist,"Assist Dušan Tadić ; Tadic provides the assist, though that was all in the skill and clinical nature of Gabbiadini."
45',goal,Goal Manolo Gabbiadini ; SAINT MANOLO STRIKES AGAIN! Absolutely stunning individual effort from Gabbiadini who does brilliantly to disguse his run and turn beyond Kone inside the area before finishing expertly past Mannone to double Southampton's lead just before the interval!
42',action,"STAT: Manolo Gabbiadini is just the second Saints player to have ever scored in their first two Premier League appearances for the club, with Henri Camara doing so in February 2005."
40',action,"Southampton are growing more comfortable with each passing minute. They're defending much better, which had been an area of concern for them coming into today with the injury to Virgil van Dijk and sale of Jose Fonte. This is a makeshift defence for Saints, one which was ripped apart last week, but they look much better in this first half."
38',action,"Sunderland fans are upset after watching the replay of Gabbiadini's goal in slow motion, which reveals that the ball actually went in off the elbow of the striker, or at least it appears that way. It was awfully hard to tell as Kone and Gabbiadini both attacked it at high speed. Upon further review it looks like it shouldn't have been allowed, but it's an absolutely impossible one for the referee to spot, in fairness. It's hard enough to tell in a slow-motion replay."
36',action,"This has been the problem with Sunderland this year. When they do fall behind it's like they're drained of any and all confidence, and that's when the issues are compounded. They're in need of a jolt here, something the crowd can and should provide them with."
34',action,"This will be worrisome for David Moyes as the possession advantage enjoyed by his side in the first half has been much fuss about nothing. They have a poor record playing from behind this season, something they haven't had to do over the last couple weeks. They haven't trailed at home since January 14, a 3-1 defeat to Stoke."
32',action,"STAT: Sunderland haven’t kept a clean sheet in any of their last nine Premier League games against the Saints (including today), conceding 17 goals – although half of those came in an 8-0 defeat in October 2014."
30',assist,Assist Ryan Bertrand ; A devilish delivery from Bertrand to provide the assist.
30',goal,"Goal Manolo Gabbiadini ; SOUTHAMPTON STRIKE FIRST! It's been coming, in all fairness! Bertrand makes strides down the left and bends in a stunning cross for Gabbiadini, who appeared to knock it home with his shoulder, with Kone and O'Shea draped all over him! That's two in two for the new signing!"
28',action,"Southampton continue in the ascendency, but there's nothing menacing about the way they're getting forward. Sunderland almost seem to be bullying them in defence. The visitors need to find a better end product to make their spells in possession lead to something further."
26',action,"Good running off the ball from Gabbiadini, who makes himself available, taking a pass and bursting into the area cleverly. He fends off Mannone's charge before picking out Cedric with an excellent ball, but the full-back scuffs his first-time effort high and wide at the near post."
24',action,STAT: There hasn’t been a goalless draw between these sides in any competition since March 1978 – each of the last 37 games has seen at least one goal scored.
22',action,"There's a real scrap blossoming in midfield. The battle for possession continues to intensify, growing a bit cagey as the ball becomes contained in the midfield third. Neither side are lacking in desire, but it's the absence of quality at times which has plagued each of them in their attempts to take charge."
20',action,"Lovely defending! Better play here from Southampton in the final third, capped off by a clever first-time dink over the top from Tadic to invite Gabbiadini through on goal, but the striker can't get his first touch right, before Denayer comes in from the back to get a touch in, sending the ball behind off the striker for a goal-kick."
18',action,"Southampton have weathered the storm a bit here, but they have looked very much second best through the opening stages of this match. There's no threat to their attacking play and not much of a convincing nature to how they've defended thus far."
16',action,"REMARKABLE RUNNING! That's a stunning bit of direct attacking from Januzaj, who skips beyond a few defenders, making it look incredibly easy in the process. He dances his way into the area, somehow, before picking out Defoe exquisitely. The striker is almost taken by surprise at the fact that he was spotted there, and he can't sort out his footing as the chance goes begging."
14',action,STAT: Sunderland have kept as many clean sheets in their last two league outings (2) as they did in the 22 games under David Moyes prior to that.
12',action,"Plenty of anticipation as three Sunderland players stand over the free-kick, but it's much abuzz about nothing in the end as Larsson's effort smacks against the wall and runs away to safety."
11',action,"The crowd screams for Ndong to let fly as he's picked out encouragingly in the centre by Oviedo, but he doesn't get the chance to shoot as Redmond barges him over from behind, instead conceding a free-kick in a dangerous position, just under 30 yards from goal."
9',action,"Very good pressure being applied here by Sunderland, as they get after this Southampton defence, attacking with a smart width about them. They fail to make anything of a pair of corners and a set-piece in a threatening location, however."
7',action,"DREADFUL HEADER! Oviedo bends in a sound cross, but no one is there to really threaten. Bertrand meets it, but his clearing header is abysmal, sending the ball straight to Januzaj, but his attempt to curl one in at the far post is thwarted by Bertrand who does well to recover and block it behind."
5',action,"Southamton appear a bit more determined to play on the ball, but Sunderland have dropped so many players into defence when the visitors get in possession. The Black Cats are closing their gaps well as they maintain a spirited approach in defence that helped them keep clean sheets in their last two matches."
3',action,"The start to the match has resembled the weather on Wearside this afternoon, unkind and largely unenjoyable. Neither side has managed to maintain any extended possession, with some sloppy passing plaguing the opening minutes."
1',action,"AND THEY'RE OFF! Southampton get us underway on an archetypally cold, damp and windy day in the northeast."
,action,"Claude Puel makes a pair of changes from last weekend's defeat to West Ham at St. Mary's. Striker Manolo Gabbiadini continues to lead the line following his debut goal against the Hammers, but today he will be flanked by Nathan Redmond, recalled to the XI after an injury, and Dusan Tadic, as Sofiane Boufal misses out with an ankle injury and Jay Rodriguez is dropped to the bench."
,action,"David Moyes is forced into making one change from the 4-0 win at Crystal Palace last weekend, with Darron Gibson coming in to replace Jack Rodwell, who misses out with a hamstring problem."
,action,"SUBS: Gardos, Long, Rodriguez, Hojbjerg, McQueen, Sims, Hassen."
,action,"SOUTHAMPTON (4-3-3): Forster; Cedric, Stephens, Yoshida, Bertrand; Ward-Prowse, Romeu, Davis; Redmond, Tadic, Gabbiadini."
,action,"SUBS: Borini, Khazri, Mika, Lescott, Pienaar, Manquillo, Honeyman."
,action,"SUNDERLAND (3-5-2): Mannone; Denayer, O'Shea, Kone; Jones, Ndong, Gibson, Larsson, Oviedo; Januzaj; Defoe."
,action,CONFIRMED TEAM NEWS:
,action,"There are still seven points and four clubs separating them from the bottom three, so it would take some doing for Saints to be dragged into a relegation scrap, but these are anxious moments nonetheless for Claude Puel's troops. They have to do with beating the teams below them, and it has to start today."
,action,"On the opposite touchline, visitors Southampton are reeling. The Saints have lost six of their last seven in the league as the summer departure of manager Ronald Koeman really starts to rear it's ugly head. There's been ups and downs under Claude Puel, but 2017 has provided little reason for optimism."
,action,"Jermain Defoe and company unexpectedly found the scoring well last weekend as they went on to shock Crystal Palace and former manager Sam Allardyce 4-0 at Selhurst Park, dragging the Eagles into a share of last place. Sunderland will be full of confidence as they return home this afternoon, just two points from safety in what is a congested bottom six."
,action,"Sunderland are still rooted at the bottom of the Premier League table on goal difference, but for the first time all season there's light at the end of the tunnel. The Black Cats are unbeaten in two league games for the second time this campaign and have kept successive clean sheets for the first time all season."
,action,Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Stadium of Light as one of the Premier League's tightest relegation battles in recent memory serves up another race-shaping tie as Sunderland host Southampton!
