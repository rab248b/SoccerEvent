,action,"The referee puts Stoke out of their misery, as Liverpool cruise to a 4-1 win at Anfield. It rarely looked like being quite so clear-cut in the first hal, with the visitors giving a good account of themselves, but in the second period Klopp's men really upped the ante and drove forward rather ruthlessly to finish them off. A deserved win and now they look to Manchester City's visit on Saturday."
90'+3',action,FULL-TIME!
90'+2',action,"Liverpool are still searching for goal, as Milner wins a corner. They play it short and it is clipped into the box from Can, but Wijnaldum can't quite reach it with his head."
90',action,There will be three minutes added on here.
88',action,"The visitors continue to enjoy a prolonged period of possession, but they don't get very far, as Milner soon sweeps up a hopeful pass towards Bony."
86',action,"Stoke are still giving this a shot, but Liverpool are coping pretty easily, with Henderson on this occasion battling back to tackle Afellay on the edge of the area."
84',substitution,"; Off goes Crouch now, with Bony taking his place in attack."
83',action,"Stoke are carved open again. Mane bides his time in the area before teeing up Henderson on the edge of the box. His shot is blocked by Sturridge and it sits up nicely for Moreno, but his acrobatic effort is halted by Shawcross."
81',action,"Stoke have struggled to offer anything at all in the second half. All credit has to go to Liverpool here, who have been really good and responded brilliantly to initially falling behind."
79',substitution,"; Final Liverpool change now. Alberto Moreno comes on for his 100th appearance for the club, replacing Firmino."
77',action,"Good play by Afellay, as he tricks his way past Henderson and shoots from distance, seeing his effort fly just over from 25 yards."
75',substitution,"; Stoke change now, as Afellay makes his first appearance since April. Diouf makes way."
74',action,"STOKE SURVIVE! Liverpool work a corner well and Henderson picks out a lofted pass into the left side of the goal for Lovren. He squares the ball into the danger zone with a volley, but it strikes Firmino and he cannot direct it towards goal."
72',action,"Stoke haven't had an answer to Liverpool in the second half. They've been architects of their own downfall, but the hosts have been very good."
70',goal,"Goal Daniel Sturridge ; GOAL!!! IT'S SURELY ALL OVER! Shawcross is guilty of an awful back-pass which is seized upon by Sturridge, who coolly rounds Grant and strokes into an empty goal."
69',substitution,; And Sturridge replaces Origi for their second switch.
69',substitution,"; First of two changes now for Liverpool, as Can replaces Lallana."
68',action,Liverpool are surely home and dry now and they certainly look good value for this lead. You wouldn't put it past them adding a couple more.
66',substitution,"; First change for Stoke now, as the ineffective Whelan is replaced by Sobhi."
65',action,"Milner has been excellent today and he does well yet again, linking with Firmino before getting into the area. He twists and turns, before clipping a cross to the back post and Clyne heads it at Grant, who makes the save."
63',action,"We have a pause in play now, as Diouf catches Lallana in the face with a flailing hand. He will be fine to continue."
61',action,"Almost a fourth! Firmino passes to Mane to his left just outside the area and his effort deflects just wide of the post. The corner comes to nothing, though."
59',own-goal,"Own Goal Gilbert Gianelli Imbula Wanga ; GOAL!!! THE HOSTS HAVE A THIRD! It all stemmed from a poor Imbula header, which was pounced upon by Henderson. He slips Origi into the left side of the area to square across the face of goal and Imbula puts it into his own goal."
58',action,"Allen has had a good game for Stoke so far today, and this time he is there just in time to get a foot in and half Clyne's charge into the box, passing back to Grant and allowing the goalkeeper to clear."
56',action,"Frustration for Crouch, as he accidentally knocks the ball out for a throw-in while shielding it in the corner. He enjoys a bit of a light-hearted exchange with the crowd, pulling the corner flag from the ground and dropping it on the floor. But he laughs away with the fans and puts it back where it was, presumably what saves him from a booking."
55',action,"Better from Stoke, as Allen gets forward after good play by Imbula and the Welshman feeds Diouf into the right side of the area, winning a corner from Milner. The set-piece doesn't come to much, though."
53',action,What a waste. Imbula's free-kick goes straight out for a goal-kick. Hughes does not look impressed.
52',action,"Walters does well, as he backs into Milner as the left-back jumps and he wins Stoke a free-kick out on the right. This is a good chance for the visitors."
50',action,"Excellent football from the hosts. Milner cuts in from the left, plays a one-two with Mane and then shoots for the far side of the goal and miscues his effort rather badly. Still, a fine move."
48',action,"A rare moment of involvement for Imbula, who forces his way out wide after stealing the ball and he wins a throw-in. Stoke need more from him in this second half."
46',action,Off we go for the second half.
,action,"The referee brings an entertaining first half to a close, with Liverpool rallying after initially falling behind and they take a 2-1 lead into the break. Stoke have certainly had their moments and the home side do not look particularly tight at the back, but going forward they've really turned it on towards the end. More of the same in the second half, please!"
45'+3',action,HALF-TIME!
45'+1',action,"CLOSE! Almost a third for Liverpool, as Milner surges forward and squares across the edge of the box to Mane, whose first-time left-footed effort goes just wide of the bottom-right corner despite not being struck cleanly."
44',assist,Assist James Milner ; Great movement by Milner to lose his man and then he showed great awareness to find Firmino. That's his sixth assist of the season.
44',goal,"Goal Roberto Firmino Barbosa de Oliveira ; GOAL!!! LIVERPOOL HAVE THE LEAD! Lallana does well out on the left, biding his time before picking his pass, just inside to Milner. He in turn finds Firmino and the Brazilian plays a left-footed effort which ultimately hits both posts before finding the net."
43',action,Liverpool have had 81% of the possession in the last 10 minutes. That says all you need to know about things changing.
41',action,"That was a tricky situation there. Mane does well on the right, playing a give-and-go and getting into the penalty area. Imbula comes across and effectively forces him off the pitch, but he was very close to making contact and conceding a penalty."
39',action,"Lovely football again from the hosts and they should be ahead. Lallana is released into the right side of the area and he cuts the ball back to Firmino, whose first-time effort goes over the crossbar."
37',action,"Another Liverpool shot now, as the ball breaks kindly for Milner and he has a go from distance. Grant has no problems with the tame effort, though."
36',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Joe Allen ; That's a wild tackle from Allen, as he goes crashing in on Wijnaldum and gets nothing of the ball. Out comes the yellow card."
34',goal,"Goal Adam Lallana ; GOAL!!! LIVERPOOL ARE LEVEL! Mane races on to a pass up the right and he coolly feeds it into the danger zone. Lallana gets a touch to it and knocks it on to Johnson, and the ball ricochets back to the England international, who provides a tidy finish from a tight angle."
33',action,"Mane is furious with the officials, as he races up the right in behind Pieters, who rather aggressively takes possession away and no free-kick is given."
31',action,"Back come the visitors again. They work it in from the right flank and eventually Walters lines it up for a shot, which is blocked on the edge of the box by Klavan."
30',action,"Stoke are really causing some problems. This time it's Pieters, as he gets into the left side of the area and attempts to pass into the danger zone, but Lovren is there to clear."
29',action,"Allen is involved again for Stoke, this time crossing to the the right side of the area from the left flank. He finds Diouf, but his attempted headed pass to Crouch is easily gobbled up by Mignolet."
27',action,"Lallana is almost played into the left side of the penalty area, but Johnson comes across well and steals it before clearing the danger. He has started well."
25',action,"OFF THE LINE! Lallana's cross from the right is blocked but it quickly falls for Firmino. He squeezes a shot through a crowd of players, but Crouch is there to hack it away just before it can find the net."
23',action,"Good play by Lallana, as he turns in the penalty area and then gets a left-footed shot away, but Shawcross deflects it just past the post."
22',action,STAT: That was Walters' sixth Premier League goal against Liverpool - more than he has managed against any other team.
21',action,Stoke have certainly sensed a weakness in this Liverpool defence and they are doing their best to exploit it on every occasion. So far they've really struggled with the combined physical threat of Walters and Crouch.
19',action,"LIVERPOOL SURVIVE! Brilliant play by Allen, as he wriggles his way into the penalty area and drills low and hard towards goal. Mignolet makes the save with his right foot but sends it right back into the danger zone. Thankfully for him, however, Crouch can't quite reach it and then Pieters sees an effort blocked."
18',action,"Back come Stoke and Pieters makes himself a threat again, with his left-wing cross put behind. The corner is completely wasted, though, as Allen's delivery doesn't even beat the first man."
17',action,"Another Liverpool shot fails to hit the target, as Lallana tees Milner up just outside the area and his effort sails well over."
16',action,"We are back under way and Lovren, still holding his nose a bit, wonders on to the pitch."
14',action,"We have a pause in play now, as Lovren receives medical attention after a blow to the face. He headed the back of Crouch's head."
12',assist,"Assist Erik Pieters ; A lovely cross from the left by Pieters, teeing Walters up nicely."
12',goal,"Goal Jonathan Walters ; GOAL!!! STOKE ARE AHEAD! An initial Diouf cross causes trouble and Crouch manages to get a header away. It's cleared, but the ball is swiftly put back into the danger zone by Pieters and Walters meets it at the near post, squeezing it inside the upright as Mignolet knocks it into the goal."
11',action,"Good goalkeeping. Stoke enjoy a rare venture into the Liverpool half and Diouf manages to squeeze a cross in towards Crouch, but Mignolet plucks it out of the air in commanding fashion."
10',action,It's all Liverpool at the moment. Stoke have everyone but Crouch behind the ball and the hosts are certainly finding openings in spite of the crowded penalty area.
8',action,"Good play again by Liverpool, who are exerting plenty of control so far. They manage to work themselves out of a tricky situation out on the left and Firmino gets a shot away from a tight angle, which Grant clutches gratefully."
6',action,"Liverpool win themselves a corner, as Origi plays the ball against Martins Indi. They play it short and work it well to the edge of the box for Henderson, but his controlled effort goes over."
5',action,"Another lovely delivery from the right, as Mane races forward and clips a brilliantly weighted cross into the area which is once again just a little too far ahead of Firmino."
3',action,"Positive start from Origi, as the Belgian drops deep on the right, darts in towards the middle and then plays a through pass into the penalty area, but it is just a little overhit for Firmino."
1',action,Off we go! Liverpool get us started.
,action,"The teams are out, with kick-off just a few moments away."
,action,"Stoke will do well to get a result here today. They haven't won any of their last three games in the Premier League, while Liverpool haven't lost at home over 90 minutes in any competition since January."
,action,"Liverpool are fully aware of what is at stake here today. They did well to come away from their recent derby with a last-gasp winner, but all of their title rivals won yesterday and up next on Saturday is the small matter of Manchester City at Anfield. Victory over Stoke with take them back to second, six points behind Chelsea"
,action,"On the other side of things, Stoke make just a single change and it will likely mean something of a shift in approach. Bojan drops to the bench and Peter Crouch - returning to his former stomping ground - replaces him in attack. Although Stoke surrendered a two-goal lead last time out, Mark Hughes seemingly isn't too disappointed with their general team effort against Leicester City."
,action,"There aren't any surprises in the Liverpool team, as Jurgen Klopp names the same starting XI for the third successive Premier League match. Joel Matip still isn't ready to return from his ankle injury, meaning Ragnar Klavan continues to deputise alongside Dejan Lovren. Meanwhile on the bench, Daniel Sturridge and Emre Can continue to wait in the wings following their appearances as substitutes against Everton last time out."
,action,"Stoke subs: Given, Adam, Sobhi, Afellay, Shaqiri, Bojan, Bony."
,action,"Stoke City starting XI (3-5-2): Grant; Johnson, Shawcross, Martins Indi; Diouf, Whelan, Imbula, Allen, Pieters; Walters, Crouch."
,action,"Liverpool subs: Karius, Moreno, Lucas, Ejaria, Can, Woodburn, Sturridge."
,action,"Liverpool starting XI (4-2-3-1): Mignolet; Clyne, Lovren, Klavan, Milner; Henderson, Wijnaldum; Mane, Firmino, Lallana; Origi"
,action,"First of all, let's introduce the teams..."
,action,"Hello and welcome to the LIVE coverage of the Premier League meeting between Liverpol and Stoke City. I will be describing all of the action for you today, as these two sides go head-to-head at Anfield with the hosts looking to remain in touch at the top of the table."
