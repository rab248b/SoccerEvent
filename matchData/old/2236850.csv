,action,"Five different scorers for Unai Emery's men in front of a record crowd at the Stade Velodrome, as they extend their unbeaten run to a record 14 matches over their bitter rivals. That's all for our live coverage from Marseille, thanks for following along! Goodbye."
90'+1',action,FULL-TIME: MARSEILLE 1-5 PSG.
90',action,Just one minute to be added on.
88',action,"The match is being played at walking pace now as both teams eagerly await the final whistle. There doesn't figure to be much time, if any, added on at the end of this match given the scoreline."
86',action,STAT: PSG have scored at least two goals in 14 of their last 15 matches against Marseille in all competitions (including today).
84',yellow-card,Yellow Card Rémy Cabella ; Frustration gets the better of Remy Cabella who goes through the back of his opponent in an attempt to win the ball and sees yellow as a result.
83',yellow-card,Yellow Card Julian Draxler ; Yellow card Julian Draxler
82',substitution,; Hatem Ben Arfa replaces Cavani with the final change of the night for either side.
80',action,"The tempo has slowed drastically into the final 10 minutes now. Marseille realised quickly just how easily they were being carved apart when they commit bodies forward, and at the risk of this getting any more embarrassing, they have started to close up shop."
78',action,"Marseille have been improved this season, but this defeat should serve as a reality check for them as to just how far away there are from competing. Defensively they have been an absolute wreck against the top teams, losing 4-1 at this venue against Monaco in January and 3-1 at Lyon the week after."
76',action,STAT: Marseille had previously kept a clean sheet in 11 of their last 14 home matches in Ligue 1.
74',action,"OFF THE WOODWORK! Lovely bit of skill from Payet to work himself into space for a shot in the left channel and beat Trapp, but not the frame of the goal, as his effort smacks off the far post before being ushered to safety by PSG!"
73',substitution,; A second PSG change sees Angel di Maria replace Lucas.
72',assist,"Assist Marco Verratti ; Verratti picks up the assist, his first of the night, but the second goal he's had a hand in."
72',goal,"Goal Blaise Matuidi ; STUNNING HIT! A brilliantly struck effort from Matuidi who guides a finish into the top corner, leaving Pele rooted to his spot, after some clever interplay between Draxler and Verratti to tee him up."
70',assist,Assist Maxime Lopez ; Good composure from Lopez to pick out Fanni there instead of just rifle it back aimlessly into the danger area.
70',goal,"Goal Rod Fanni ; MARSEILLE PULL ONE BACK! Consolation for the hosts, but hardly anything they deserve. Trapp doesn't get enough as he punches clear a Payet corner, allowing Lopez to send it back into the danger area where Fanni is on hand to turn and tuck it in at the near post."
67',substitution,; Gregory Sertic replaces Thauvin with Marseille's final change of the night.
65',action,"STAT: The last seven meetings between these sides at the Stade Velodrome, across all competitions, have produced 27 goals, averaging just shy of four per match."
63',action,"What an absolute catastrophe this has become for Marseille. There's very few people out there who could have predicted such a tasteless, lackluster showing in front of a record attendance at the Stade Velodrome."
61',assist,Assist Thomas Meunier ; Meunier has been excellent tonight and he's rewarded with an assist.
61',goal,"Goal Julian Draxler ; PSG RUNNING RIOT! Meunier makes waves down the right and sends a low delivery across the face of goal for Draxler, who inexplicably gets behind both Fanni and Sakai to tap home a simple finish! Marseille's defence is in shambles."
59',action,Matuidi with a chance for PSG as they continue to pour the pressure on. Marseille are walking a fine line here and they have to be very careful of letting this one potentially get out of hand.
57',action,"STAT: PSG have won each of their last four away matches in the league for the first time this season. It’s their longest run since winning five in a row between December 2015 and February 2016, the fifth of which was a 2-1 success in Marseille."
55',substitution,"; A nice applause for Pastore from his team-mates, making his first start in five months, as he's replaced here by Julian Draxler."
54',action,"PARRIED BY PELE! One-way traffic at the Velodrome as PSG threaten to add to their lead. Kurzawa goes on a clever jaunt into the final third and tries his luck from distance, forcing Pele into a smart save."
52',substitution,"; N'Jie has been close to invisible tonight and his night is mercifully brought to an end here, with Remy Cabella on to replace him."
50',assist,"Assist Blaise Matuidi ; Matuidi turns provider for this one, picking up the assist."
50',goal,"Goal Lucas Rodrigues Moura da Silva ; RIGHT ON COURSE! Three goals and surely three points, you would have to think, for PSG. Fanni makes a mess of a clearance, giving the ball away high up the pitch, before a delivery across goal is touched on by Matuidi for Lucas, who creeps in ahead of Vainqueur to roll home PSG's third goal of the night!"
48',action,"There's a hint of disheartenment about Marseille, no renewed spirit or belief like one would have perhaps expected coming out of his interval. You have to wonder what Rudi Garcia said to his side at the break, and just how effective it was."
46',action,Here we go again...
46',substitution,; Well there was admittedly a concern about Evra's performance in that first half and those doubts ring true as he's replaced at the interval by Henri Bedimo.
,action,"Goals from Marquinhos and Edinson Cavani have provided PSG with a commanding lead at the interval, capitalising on some poor Marseille defending as they appear on course for a crucial three points in the scope of the title race. Still 45 minutes to play, though, so nothing has been decided just yet."
45',action,HALF-TIME: MARSEILLE 0-2 PSG.
44',action,"Chance for Payet from a free-kick as anticipation builds in the stadium. It looks a bit further out than he would like, though. Payet is more than capable of the spectacular, but he can't produce it here as he fails to clear the wall and the chance is gone."
42',action,"STAT: PSG are unbeaten in their last 13 competitive matches (W11, D2), outscoring their opponents 38-4 over that span."
40',action,"SAFE HANDS FROM PELE! The Marseille keeper does well to collect the ball following a header from Cavani, under real pressure inside his six-yard box. Marseille are barely holding onto their hats here, in danger of conceding a third before the interval that would surely put an end to this contest."
38',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Patrice Evra ; You hate to speculate, but Evra looks a red card waiting to happen tonight. He's just picked up his first yellow, and given the events of this first half, you wouldn't bet against him getting another."
37',action,"There's a real nice flow to this match now as we enter the final 10 minutes of the first half. Marseille are taking a few more chances as they look to push the tempo, desperate for any sort of spark in attack. Meanwhile, PSG continue to look threatening when they get forward, with the hosts shockingly unable to defend a set piece."
35',action,"DISALLOWED! An absolutely incredible sequence inside the Marseille area! Silva beats Rolando in the air to win a header off a corner, which Pele saves on the line. The rebound is knocked off the post before finding its way back to Silva, who bundles home, but the offside flag is raised! Talk about a game of pinball..."
33',action,"Much better approach play from the hosts here as they start to show signs of life. Their best sequence of the night thus far comes here, just after the half-hour mark, but they lack the necessary final ball in attack to really cut open the PSG defence, having to settle for a corner which the visitors deal with appropriately."
31',action,"STAT: Marseille have scored at least a goal in each of their last 12 league matches against PSG at home, dating back to a 1-0 defeat in November 2003."
29',yellow-card,Yellow Card Marco Verratti ; A silly and altogether needless yellow card for Verratti as he breaks up a Marseille counter with a handball.
28',action,"A professional, workmanlike display from PSG as they pass the ball around in midfield, playing keep-away from the hosts. They are showing no signs of letting their command on the game slip in the slightest here."
26',action,"The noise level continues to decrease inside the Velodrome. In fact, there's audible groans from these home supporters that are starting to drown out any cheers, not that they have much to cheer about at the moment."
24',action,"You can see why Marseille have struggled so much against PSG in recent years. If there was ever a chance to beat them, this was it, really. All the pressure in the world was on the visitors, coming into such a hostile atmosphere, yet Marseille have gone and completely bottled it inside of 25 minutes."
22',action,"MARSEILLE IN SHAMBLES! This is turning into a nightmare for Rudi Garcia! Rolando and Patrice Evra collide as they both take a passive approach to a loose ball, allowing Lucas to pounce and run through on goal, but Pele produces a terrific stop to deny the Brazilian before Cavani hooks his acrobatic overhead-kick rebound over the bar."
20',action,"STAT: Marseille have lost just one of their last 16 league matches at the Velodrome, keeping 12 clean sheets (W10, D5)."
18',action,"Well it's safe to say the pressure has not got to PSG tonight. They looked somewhat shaky in the opening few minutes, but Marseille were expected to push on early with the backing of these home supporters. Full marks to Unai Emery for how he's prepared his team tonight."
16',assist,Assist Javier Matías Pastore ; An assist out of the top drawer from Pastore.
16',goal,"Goal Edinson Roberto Cavani Gómez ; THE VELODROME HAS BEEN SILENCED! Stunned, shocked and sick to their stomachs are these Marseille supporters as PSG double their lead! An absolutely stunning delicately chipped first-time pass from Pastore springs Cavani, who produces a delicate finish to beat Pele. That's a work of art!"
14',action,"INCHES WIDE! You certainly wouldn't bet against him scoring! The man for the occasion, the man for every occasion, Dimitri Payet, drives forward in possession after some good work from Clinton N'Jie to win the ball back, but his curling effort from 25 yards drifts agonisingly wide of the far post!"
12',action,"Rudi Garcia shouts instructions from the touchline and while it's not entirely clear what he's saying, you have to imagine it has something to do with intensity, because his troops immediately reply with some fierce running and defensive work, getting after the PSG ball carrier with plenty of gusto."
10',action,"There's a real confidence about PSG now as they knock the ball around assuredly in midfield. These home supporters have had little to cheer about when Marseille meet PSG in recent memory, and this poor start from their side is doing nothing to restore the faith that tonight might be different."
8',action,"STAT: PSG have won 11 of the last 12 editions of Le Classique, the lone exception being a scoreless draw at home to Marseille in the reverse fixture this season. Their current 13 match unbeaten run against Marseille is their longest ever run against them."
6',assist,Assist Thiago Emiliano da Silva ; Thiago Silva picks up the assist with a good read and unselfish decision in close.
6',goal,"Goal Marcos Aoás Corrêa ; PSG SNATCH AN EARLY LEAD! That should go miles to help their confidence! It's a routine free-kick that's headed back across goal by Thiago Silva, where Marquinhos is waiting to guide a free header into the back of the net!"
5',action,"PSG are slowly starting to get their footing under them, but the nervy start could have been anticipated. Combine the incredibly hostile atmosphere with the dire need for three points, and this is a rather pressure-filled situation for the visitors. They win a throw-in on the fringe of the attacking third and Meunier is littered with debris from the fans behind him."
3',action,"A record attendance of over 65,000 fans are predicted to be watching on from inside the stadium tonight, and it sounds as though every one of them is cheering as Marseille push forward and win the game's first corner - though it results in nothing for the hosts."
1',action,"AND THEY'RE OFF! A cauldron of noise - it is LOUD - inside the Velodrome as Marseille get the match underway! The hosts are in white, attacking left to right, with PSG in dark blue."
,action,"Thomas Meunier, Thiago Silva and Layvin Kurzawa are all brought back into defence, replacing Serge Aurier, Presnel Kimpembe and the injured Maxwell, while Marco Verratti and Javier Pastore get the nod in midfield and attack at the expense of Christopher Nkunku and Julian Draxler."
,action,"Unai Emery rotated his squad last weekend and was made to regret it as they drew at home to PSG. Hindsight is 20/20, though, and the squad is back close to full strength tonight. Thiago Motta misses out through injury, pulling Adrien Rabiot into a defensive role and paving the way for Blaise Matuidi to return to the starting line-up, one of six changes made from the Toulouse match."
,action,"Rudi Garcia makes just two changes to his side from the victory over Rennes last weekend, as Rod Fanni and Hiroki Sakai return from suspension to feature in defence at the expense of Gregory Sertic and Morgan Sanson, with Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa pushing up into a midfield role."
,action,"SUBS: Areola, Kimpembe, Aurier, Nkunku, Di Maria, Ben Arfa, Draxler."
,action,"PSG (4-3-3): Trapp; Meunier, Marquinhos, Silva, Kurzawa; Rabiot, Verratti, Matuidi; Lucas, Pastore, Cavani."
,action,"SUBS: Bedimo, Cabella, Doria Macedo, Rabillard, Samba, Sanson, Sertic."
,action,"MARSEILLE (4-3-3): Pele; Sakai, Fanni, Rolando, Evra; Lopez, Vainqueur, Anguissa; Thauvin, Payet, N'Jie."
,action,CONFIRMED TEAM NEWS:
,action,"Rudi Garcia’s side would strengthen Monaco’s grip on first with as little as a draw, given the more than negotiable nature of the leader’s remaining schedule. Should Marseille end the night with a first victory over their rivals since 2011, it would prove rather ominous for PSG’s rapidly fading title hopes."
,action,"Marseille’s season has been hampered by their struggles away from home, but that won’t come into play tonight as they take to the friendly confines of the Stade Velodrome, with PSG supporters banned from attending, looking to improve on their impressive home resume and deal their bitter rivals’ title hopes a massive blow."
,action,"PSG have turned a corner in 2017 following an altogether unconvincing first half of the season. The bar is set high once again for the capital club, but the pressure-filled situation has reached a boiling having being held to a 0-0 draw at home to Toulouse last weekend."
,action,"Monaco’s 2-1 win away to Guingamp on Saturday provided them with a six point cushion over PSG heading into Le Classique, manufacturing what certainly has the feel of a must-win situation for Unai Emery’s men, who are in real danger of falling out of the title race."
