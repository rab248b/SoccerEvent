,action,"Second-half goals from Eric Dier and Heung-Min Son help Spurs to a crucial three points, as Burnley lose their first league match at Turf Moor since November. That's all for our live coverage, thanks for following along. Goodbye!"
90'+4',action,FULL-TIME: BURNLEY 0-2 TOTTENHAM.
90'+2',action,"Full marks to Spurs this afternoon. They didn't have it easy by any means, but they showed good patience to persevere and find a way to get the job done at a venue where very few teams leave with three points."
90',action,There will be four minutes added on at the end of this match.
89',action,"There should be a decent amount of time added on at the end of the 90, but it looks like too tall of an order for Burnley to salvage anything. They have a free-kick and Brady's delivery is dangerous, but Lloris deals with it really well under pressure from Vokes."
87',action,"STAT: Dele Alli has been involved in 11 goals in 11 Premier League appearances for Tottenham in 2017 so far - eight goals, three assists (including today)."
85',action,"Another mistake from Burnley in midfield allows Spurs to break through Son. The substitute returns the favour, picking out Alli in the area, but the midfielder drags his shot wide of the far post! He should have a couple of goals today, with even some half-decent finishing."
83',action,"The tempo is fizzling out as Burnley accept their fate. Spurs are taking a more relaxed approach in possession, keeping it far away from the danger area, while Burnley aren't pressing with nearly as much intensity."
81',action,"CLOSE TO A THIRD! Burnley's focus has gone now and Spurs are threatening to add to their lead. Alli carves out space for himself and bends an effort towards the far post, narrowly missing the top corner."
79',yellow-card,Yellow Card Ashley Barnes ; Barnes becomes just the second player booked on the night.
78',substitution,"; Steven Defour makes his return to action for Burnley after two months out, replacing Arfield."
77',assist,"Assist Bamidele Alli ; Alli provides the assist, showing some excellent vision there."
77',goal,"Goal Heung-Min Son ; IMMEDIATE IMPACT! Eriksen does brilliantly to win the ball in midfield and send Alli forward with an exquisite ball over the top. Alli keeps his head up and threads a pass across the box for Son, who taps home into an empty net from six yards."
76',action,"The chances are starting to come for Burnley, but they're snatching at them right now. Keane and Arfield both have shooting chances, each failing to hit the target, before Spurs break the other way to try and capitalise on the space being left in the Burnley defence."
74',substitution,; A second change here for Burnley as they bring on record signing Robbie Brady at the expense of Boyd.
73',substitution,; Heung-Min Son is on to replace Janssen.
72',action,"Arfield hits a really poor corner that doesn't get by the first defender at the near post. Burnley can't afford to waste these opportunities. Meanwhile, Janssen has gone down with what looks like a cramp, as both teams appear prepared to make changes."
70',action,"With Chelsea still trailing 2-1 against Palace, that Dier goal could prove to have massive ramifications in the title race- which wasn't much of a race at all coming into the weekend. Still 20 minutes remaining in both matches, so nothing is set it stone just yet by any means."
68',action,"STAT: Burnley have won just one of their five previous Premier League games against Tottenham (W1 D1 L3), back in May 2010 when Brian Laws’ already-relegated side won 4-2."
66',goal,"Goal Eric Dier ; SPURS HAVE THE BREAKTHROUGH! An absolutely abysmal attempt to clear a corner from Hendrick as he sends the ball straight to Dier, unmarked, eight yards out, and he makes no mistake, finding a hole in the crowd as he sends the ball into the back of the net!"
64',action,"BIG MISS! Janssen puts together a determined run into the area, fighting tooth and nail against a swarm of defenders. A good challenge takes the ball away from him, but sends it straight into the path of Sissoko who lashes a wild effort wide from 10 yards!"
62',action,"Burnley are in the ascendency as we pass the hour mark, doing well to take the space made available to them in midfield. They're working the ball around smartly, playing keep-away from Tottenham who grow frustrated as they struggle to win it back."
60',action,"Mee puts in a hard challenge into the back of Janssen, taking out his trailing leg. It's a clear foul, but for some reason Mee takes exception to the striker's reaction, which really wasn't all that much. Janssen fell forward and didn't do anything to suggest it was more than just a simple foul."
58',action,STAT: Burnley haven’t scored a goal in any of their last five Premier League games played in the month of April.
56',substitution,"; Sam Vokes comes on as Dyche makes his first change of the night, replacing Gray."
55',action,"There's a much better tempo through the first 10 minutes of this second half than there was at any point in the first. Spurs are looking a bit more aware in attack, keen to push the pace, while Burnley continue to pose a decent threat on the break."
53',action,"GREAT SAVE! Heaton with an outstanding piece of goalkeeping there to deny Davies' first-time effort from in close, on the end of a tidy one-two with Janssen! Sublime reactions from the keeper!"
51',action,"Spurs have changed their formation here. Dier has moved into midfield beside Dembele, as Pochettino reverts to a four-man backline. Trippier and Davies drop a bit deeper, while Sissoko (right) and Eriksen (left) flank Janssen, with Alli playing through the middle."
49',action,"IMPORTANT SAVE! Heaton isn't convincing in dealing with the initial effort from Janssen, but he stays with the rebound and sticks a crucial hand in to deny Sissoko on the follow-up!"
47',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Michael Keane ; Keane goes into the book for a foul on Janssen, following some good hold-up play from the striker."
46',action,Back underway at Turf Moor!
,action,"Dele Alli spurned far and away the best opportunity of the first half, with chances otherwise limited at Turf Moor. Burnley have played exactly as expected, combining resolute defending with tenacity and intensity, largely frustrating Tottenham, who lost their two central midfielders to injury in the last few minutes of the half."
45'+2',action,HALF-TIME: BURNLEY 0-0 TOTTENHAM.
45'+2',substitution,"; Winks is forced off here, and that really isn't a surprise given how nasty the fall was. He's replaced by Moussa Sissoko at the very end of this first half."
45',action,"To make matters worse for Spurs, now Winks has gone down in pain after a hard tumble on the touchline. It looked a nasty one, with the Burnley trainers close by rushing to his aid. We'll see how that plays out. Meanwhile, the board goes up to indicate two minutes of added time."
44',substitution,; Mousa Dembele replaces Wanyama at the stroke of half-time.
43',action,"It's worth noting that Wanyama did try and get back on the pitch and play through the knock, but he has no success in doing so. He goes down once again, eliciting a chorus of boos from the Burnley supporters, as it disrupts a good spell from the Clarets in the attacking half."
41',action,"STAT: Christian Eriksen has had a hand in 10 goals in his last six appearances for Spurs in all competitions (three goals, seven assists)."
39',action,"Wanyama, who picked up a knock in the sequence directly following Alli's chance, following a collision with Barnes, has gone down again here. He limps over to the touchline with the help of the training staff, grabbing his back. This could very well be the end of his day."
37',action,"Trippier is back at his former home stadium this afternoon, having spent many of his early years with Burnley. He scored six goals in over 180 appearances for the club, and tries for one against them here, but skies his rather ambitious effort from 30 yards."
35',action,"It's worth noting that the Alli chance, far and ahead the best of the afternoon for Spurs, came off the back of a Burnley attack. Still the visitors have been unable to negotiate an opening at the end of their long spells in possession, but that was enticing from them on the break."
33',action,"SHOCKING MISS! That's an absolute sitter! Eriksen brilliantly weaves his way through the defence and forces a fine save from Heaton. The keeper can only parry directly into the path of Alli, who has the goal at his mercy from eight yards, but somehow misses the target!"
31',action,"Burnley win a corner, which doesn't initially come to much, but the pressure stays on and Barnes is able to meet Hendrick's cross. The striker's effort isn't on target, but again the Clarets show what sort of threat they can provide in the air. Tottenham have to do better to deny the cross."
29',action,"STAT: Dele Alli has played 60 Premier League games now, having a hand in 36 goals in 4647 minutes on the pitch (24 goals, 12 assists). In comparison, both Steven Gerrard (3959 mins) and Frank Lampard (4094 mins) had six goals & four assists after 60 league appearances."
27',action,"Good passage of play there from Burnley! The hosts piece together their best passing move of the afternoon, which sees Gray picked out in the area. The striker forces Lloris into a smart save at the near post, but the offside flag was raised so it would not have counted regardless."
25',action,"Much of the same here as Burnley continue to defend these diagonal balls with real confidence. The out ball for Gray and Barnes is always on, but they haven't been able to pick the right one out over the last few opportunities."
23',action,"Spurs are going to have their patience tested this afternoon. Burnley have everyone behind the ball and have done an excellent job of seeing away any threat. Tottenham continue to dominate possession, but there's not an opening to be had."
21',action,"One can get the sense from the first 20 minutes that this is going to be a game of few chances. All that can change that is a goal somewhere in this first half - the sooner, the better, because this is all rather congested at the moment."
19',action,"STAT: No side in Premier League history has won a higher proportion of their games (83%) or total points (78%) at home. Of Burnley’s 24 Premier League wins, 20 have come at Turf Moor."
17',action,"Off the ball, Burnley are looking to suck the life and tempo out of the match, but the second they win it back they're looking to pick out that quick out ball to get after Spurs on the break and perhaps try to capitalise on any delay they have in getting their shape back."
15',action,"Burnley are being forced to attack from out wide as well, but they've at least mustered a couple of decent deliveries into the area. The latest picks out Boyd, but he isn't able to put enough on his header to test Lloris."
13',action,"Burnley are going to congest the middle of the park, force Spurs to the wide areas and suffocate their attempts to attack with pace. You can already see the defensive philosophy of the Clarets, and it's worked well for them thus far, as Spurs have posed very little threat."
11',action,"Tottenham are lacking quality thus far when they get into the final third. Winks is the latest to overhit a cross and waste a good attacking position. There's really not much of a tempo to this match, which has been very choppy and lacked flow through the opening 10 minutes."
9',action,"STAT: Ashley Barnes has scored in two of his previous three league games against Tottenham, but both have been in White Hart Lane defeats for Burnley."
7',action,"FIRST CHANCE BURNLEY! They get forward in a flash from a goal-kick, and Barnes gets on the end of a terrific cross from Gray, but is unable to generate the required power behind his header as Lloris is able to make a comfortable stop."
5',action,"Burnley have hardly had much in terms of possession in these early stages, but they have kept Spurs to the periphery. There's an excellent atmosphere here at Turf Moor, which always seems to be the case, and is a big reason behind the Clarets' excellent home record this season."
3',action,"Tottenham force the issue in the opening minutes, winning the first corner of the afternoon through Janssen. The initial delivery is poor, but results in a second corner in quick succession. This one is played short, before eventually being crossed in, but a smart defensive header from Keane sees the threat away."
1',action,"AND THEY'RE OFF! Spurs in white as they get us underway, attacking right to left, with Burnley in their vintage claret and blue."
,action,"Mauricio Pochettino makes three changes to his side from the victory over Southampton. Vincent Janssen leads the line with Heung-Min Son likely tired from his long travel back from international duty. Harry Winks gets the nod in midfield with Mousa Dembele dropped to the bench, while Kieran Trippier starts ahead of Kyle Walker."
,action,"Sean Dyche names an unchanged side from the draw at Sunderland before the international break, but Burnley are boosted by the return of Steven Defour to the team from a two-month absence with a hamstring injury. He's available off the bench this afternoon."
,action,"SUBS: Walker, Son, Vorm, N'Koudou, Sissoko, Dembele, Carter-Vickers."
,action,"TOTTENHAM (3-4-3): Lloris; Dier, Alderweireld, Vertonghen; Trippier, Wanyama, Winks, Davies; Eriksen, Alli, Janssen."
,action,"SUBS: Flanagan, Vokes, Brady, Defour, Robinson, Westwood, Tarkowski."
,action,"BURNLEY (4-4-2): Heaton; Lowton, Keane, Mee, Ward; Boyd, Hendrick, Barton, Arfield; Gray, Barnes."
,action,CONFIRMED TEAM NEWS:
,action,"The feeling of safety has to be slowly building at Turf Moor, which should help Sean Dyche’s side play a bit looser over the final nine games of the season – and they could really do with picking up three points soon, with their last league victory coming on the final day of January."
,action,"Burnley are not totally in the clear just yet, but with an eight-point cushion and five teams between them and the relegation zone, the Clarets have to be feeling good about their prospects of playing Premier League football in 2017/18."
,action,"While Tottenham will keep their sights set on a probably futile title push, they will also have one eye behind them as Manchester City and Liverpool, two and three points back, strive to knock them out of the top-three and an automatic berth in next season’s Champions League."
,action,"As if Chelsea’s impeccable form was not already enough for Tottenham to overcome, the 10-point gap between Spurs and the runaway leaders will seem even more insurmountable now without striker Harry Kane for an extended period of time."
,action,Hello and welcome to Turf Moor for live coverage as Burnley aim to move back into the top-10 when they host a Tottenham side hoping to keep their slim title hopes alive.
