,action,"That's all from us for today, thanks for joining us and we hope you can join us again soon."
,action,Roma take the three points at the San Siro thanks to two wonder-goals from Radja Nainggolan and a penalty from Diego Perotti. Mauro Icardi pulled one back to make it 2-1 but in truth Roma always looked comfortable and deserved the win.
,action,Full-time: Inter 1-3 Roma
90'+4',action,"Perisic gets away from Rudiger and picks out Eder at the back post, but Szczesny spreads himself brilliantly to block the shot at point blank range and keep the score at 3-1."
90'+1',action,We’re into four minutes of added time at the San Siro.
89',substitution,; A defensive switch now for Roma as they look to see out this game with Thomas Vermaelen replacing Peres.
87',action,"The home crowd are certainly letting their feelings towards the referee be known following that penalty, but they can have very little complaints in truth."
85',penalty-goal,Penalty Goal Diego Perotti ; GOOOAAAALLLLL!!!! Perotti keeps his cool and slots the ball past Handanovic after Medel had clumsily brought down Dzeko.
85',action,PENALTY TO ROMA!!
84',substitution,; Another change for Roma as De Rossi is replaced by Daniel Paredes.
83',yellow-card,Yellow Card Federico Julián Fazio ; Things just getting a little bit scrappy now as Fazio also goes into the book.
83',yellow-card,Yellow Card Jeison Fabián Murillo Cerón ; Murillo goes into the book for a foul on Dzeko.
81',assist,Assist Ivan Perišić ; Perišić didn't look up before crossing there but he put the ball into a dangerous area and Icardi was in the right place.
81',goal,"Goal Mauro Emanuel Icardi Rivero ; GOOOAAALLLLL!!!! Inter pull one back!! Perisic gets in behind the Roma defence down the right-hand side and pulls a low cross across the face of goal towards the back post, where Icardi is waiting unmarked to slide the ball in from five yards out."
80',action,"De Rossi swings in the resultant free-kick towards the back post where Manolas gets up well to meet it, but his header is off target from just six yards out. That was a real chance to seal it for Roma."
80',substitution,; Substitution João Mário Naval da Costa Eduardo Éver Maximiliano David Banega
79',action,The tempo of this game has just dropped in the last couple of minutes as Nainggolan is brought down by Joao Mario. That looked to be a challenge more out of frustration than anything.
77',action,"Dzeko goes down right on the edge of the Inter box after exchanging passes with Peres, but once again referee Tagliavento ignores the appeals and waives play on."
75',substitution,; Another change for Inter now as last week’s match winner Gabriel Barbosa comes on to replace Candreva.
73',action,"A chance at the other end now as Perotti draws Handanovic out wide before crossing back towards Dzeko in the middle, but with the keeper well off his line Dzeko can only head over the bar from 12 yards out. It must be added that there were several Inter players back on the line there."
72',action,"Huge chance for Kondogbia!! Icardi gets the flick on at the near post and Kondogbia somehow fails to put the ball in the back of the net from just a couple of yards out as it gets suck under his feet, and Roma scramble the ball clear."
71',substitution,; A first change for Roma now as Salah is replaced by Diego Perotti.
70',action,"More appeals for a foul from the Inter players and fans alike as Gagliardini goes down inside the Roma penalty box under a challenge from Strootman, but the referee has got that one spot one as Strootman was simply too strong for his opponent."
68',action,"The crowd aren’t too pleased with the referee once again as he waives play on despite Joao Mario appearing to be blocked off by Rudiger, although the Inter midfielder did go down pretty easily."
66',action,"Nainggolan looks to pick out Dzeko with a cross after a quick throw-in from Jesus on the left-hand side, but he can’t over the bouncing ball and it loops high is the air, leaving Handanovic to easily gather it in."
64',action,"Another half-chance for Inter, this time for Icardi as he attacks a low Perisic cross at the near post but gets right underneath the ball as he shoots left-footed and fires the ball high over the bar from 10 yards out."
62',action,"Half-chance for Candreva as he’s played in down the right-hand edge of the box after a lovely pass through from Kondogbia, but he chooses to ignore the support in the middle and go for goal from a tight angle, but can only blast the ball straight into the side-netting."
60',action,Roma are not going to sit back and protect this lead by the looks of things here with the midfielders all still willing to get well forward in support of Dzeko.
58',action,"Inter are furious with the referee following that goal as they felt Nainggolan had committed a foul in the build up, and replays show they may well have a case."
56',goal,"Goal Radja Nainggolan ; GOOOOOOAAAALLLLLL!!!! Absolutely brilliant from Nainggolan!!!!! The Belgian midfielder picks the ball up deep inside his own half and breaks up over the halfway line before unleashing a ferocious drive into the top corner from 25 yards out, leaving Handanovic with no chance!"
56',assist,"Assist Bruno da Silva Peres ; Peres with the assist for the goal, but as with the first, it was all about a wonderful strike from Nainggolan."
55',substitution,; A first change for Inter now as Brozović is replaced by Eder.
54',action,"Kondogbia looks to lift the ball forward towards Icardi after patient build up in midfield, but the pass is a poor one and Roma regain possession. That passage of play rather sums up Inter at the moment as they’re playing some good football but lacking a cutting edge in the final third."
52',action,Inter have made a bright start to this second half here and the San Siro crowd is starting to really find its voice as a result.
50',action,"Huge chance for Perisic!!! Joao Mario picks out Perisic who's unmarked at the back post with a deep cross from the right, but the Croatian winger just takes a fraction too long to shoot from six yards out and Peres is able to get across and get a block in to deflect the ball over the bar."
48',action,"Save! Brozovic lays the ball into Candreva with a lovely flick on the right-hand corner of the box and Candreva shoots powerfully towards goal, but Szczesny gets down well at his near post to beat the ball away."
46',action,An early chance for Inter to get the ball into the box following a foul on Joao Mario. The Portuguese international lifts the free-kick into the middle himself but Manolas heads the ball well clear.
46',action,Kick-off! Referee Tagliavento blows his whistle and Inter get the second half underway.
,action,"Stefano Pioli will be hoping his side can start the second half the same way they finished the first, but may not waste too much time in turning to his bench if they don’t find an equaliser early on in the second half. Roma meanwhile will be relatively happy with their first half display, and will be confident of increasing their lead having tested Handanovic on several occasions."
,action,Roma lead at the San Siro thanks to Nainggolan’s outstanding goal inside the first quarter of an hour. Inter looked pretty sluggish for much of the half but improved significantly in the last few minutes and could have had a penalty when Fazio appeared to bring down Icardi.
,action,Half-time: Inter 0-1 Roma
45',action,Save! Brozovic has space to shoot from the edge of the box but doesn’t catch it quite as cleanly as he might have liked and Szczesny is able to palm the ball away to his left with relative ease.
44',action,"Murillo inexplicably ducks under the ball instead of heading it clear with Dzeko stood just behind him, but the striker’s lay-off towards Salah in the middle doesn’t have enough pace on it and the Inter defence are able to clear."
43',action,Inter have certainly improved in the last five minutes and Roma will be the happier of the two sides that half-time is not far away.
42',action,Much better now from Inter as Candreva whips in a superb cross from the right-hand side which Rudiger has to head behind for a corner. Icardi then gets his head to the ball from the corner but he’s over 10 yards out from goal and can only head across the face of goal and out for a goal kick.
40',yellow-card,Yellow Card Daniele De Rossi ; De Rossi becomes the second player to be shown a yellow card for a pretty poor challenge on Gagliardini.
39',action,Huge appeals for a penalty from the Inter players as Icardi goes down under a challenge from Fazio just six yards out from goal. The referee waives play on though and the home crowd are certainly not too happy with that decision.
36',action,"Wonderful save from Handanovic!! Strootman lays the ball into the path of Dzeko on the edge of the box and the striker strikes a good low effort towards the bottom corner from 15 yards out, but Handanovic gets down really well to his left to push the ball away."
35',action,"Boos ring out around the San Siro now as Antonio Candreva is prevented from taking a free-kick by the offending Bruno Peres, although it may have been more a case of the Inter man kicking the ball deliberately into the Roma wing-back."
32',action,Szczesny is down injured now after clashing with Joao Mario as he rushed off his line to gather a backwards header from Fazio. The goalkeeper was pretty brave there as he put his body on the line after what was a pretty poor header from the centre-back. It looks as though he's going to be able to continue though.
30',action,"Manolas concedes a free-kick for a rash challenge on Joao Mario just inside the Roma half, but the centre-back makes up for his error moments later as he holds of Icardi well to sheperd the ball out for a goal kick."
28',action,Salah attempts an ambitious lob from a tight angle 25 yards out from goal on the right-hand side but the effort balloons over the crossbar. Stefano Pioli will be concerned at the ease with which Salah got in behind his defence there though.
26',action,Icardi and Marcelo Brozovic are looking to press the defence when the Roma back three have the ball but at the minute their teammates aren’t backing them up and Roma are looking increasingly comfortable.
24',action,The San Siro crowd are just starting to get a little bit frustrated here and understandably so as Inter look pretty disorganised at the back and are struggling to make any real impact going forwards.
22',action,"Manolas goes on a driving run from close to halfway all the way into the Inter penalty box, but he’s just off balance as he looks to cross and the result is a weak pass which goes straight into the arms of Handanovic."
20',action,"Gagliardini does superbly well to steal the ball away from Antonio Rudiger on the edge of the Roma box and looks to pick out a teammate with a low cross, but De Rossi is in a good position in front of the near post and comfortably clears."
18',action,Roma have a free-kick in a good position 30 yards out from goal after a foul on Dzeko. De Rossi floats in the free-kick towards the back post but Roberto Gagliardini does well to get his head to it with Fazio closing in behind him.
15',action,It certainly looks as though both sides are going to attack in this game and there’s plenty of space down either flank with both sides playing three at the back.
13',action,Close! Inter very nearly hit back straight away through Joao Mario but Kostas Manolas makes an outstanding last-ditch block as Mario looks to finish from 15 yards out.
12',assist,"Assist Edin Džeko ; The pass into Nainggolan was from Dzeko, but that goal was all about individual brilliance from the midfielder!"
12',goal,Goal Radja Nainggolan ; GOOAAAALLLLL!!! What a goal from Radja Nainggolan!!!! The Belgian midfielder cuts inside onto his right foot from the left-hand touchline before curling an outstanding strike into the top corner from the edge of the box!
10',action,"It looks as though Roma have set up with a back three here with Bruno Peres and Juan Jesus playing as the right and left wing backs respectively, and they're certainly seeing plenty of the ball early on."
8',action,"Save! Roma are really on top now as Mohamed Salah gets onto his favoured left foot and shoots powerfully from the edge of the box, but the shot is too close to Handanovic who gets down well to his right to palm it away."
7',action,Daniele De Rossi takes the free-kick but Icardi is well positioned at the near post to head it away. That was a bit of a waste from Roma in truth.
6',yellow-card,Yellow Card Ivan Perišić ; Ivan Perisic has received a yellow card in unusual circumstances for deliberately flicking the ball up for himself to head back to Samir Handanovic and Roma have an indirect free-kick close to the by-line inside the box.
4',action,"Mauro Icardi gets in behind the Roma defence down the left-hand side of the box, but Federico Fazio does extremely well to get back and make the tackle on the Inter captain before he can get a shot away."
2',action,"A good start for Roma as Edin Dzeko gets the better of Jeison Murillo in the air just outside the Inter box, but the centre forward loses control of the ball and gives a way a soft foul as he looks to win it back."
1',action,Kick-off! Roma get the game underway.
,action,"Referee Paolo Tagliavento leads the players out onto the pitch, kick-off is just moments away now."
,action,"Roma came out on top when the two sides met earlier in the season at the Stadio Olimpico, with Mauro Icardi’s own goal handing Luciano Spalletti’s side a 2-1 win after Ever Banega had cancelled out Edin Dzeko’s early opener."
,action,"Roma meanwhile make a total of seven changes from the side that started against Villarreal, with only Kostas Manolas, Juan Jesus, Bruno Peres and Daniele De Rossi keeping their places."
,action,"Inter make three changes from the side that won at Bologna, with Geoffrey Kondogbia, Marcelo Brozovic and Mauro Icardi coming into the side in place of Eder, Rodrigo Palacio and the suspended Miranda."
,action,"Subs: Alisson, Lobont, Paredes, Grenier, Perotti, Totti, Vermaelen, Mario Rui, Gerson, Emerson, El Shaarawy"
,action,"Roma (4-2-3-1): Szczesny; Rudiger, Manolas, Fazio, Jesus; De Rossi, Strootman; Salah, Nainggolan, Peres; Dzeko"
,action,"Subs: Carrizo, Andreolli, Palacio, Bibiany, Ansaldi, Banega, Sainsbury, Santon, Eder, Nagatomo, Barbosa"
,action,"Team news: Inter (3-4-2-1): Handanovic; Murillo, Medel, D’Ambrosio; Candreva, Gagliardini, Kondogbia, Perisic; Brozovic, Joao Mario; Icardi"
,action,"Their recent form is particularly impressive, having won seven out of their last eight Serie A matches, and while they do come into the game having lost 1-0 to Villarreal in the Europa League last 32 on Thursday, the result was enough to see them through to the next round following a 4-0 first leg win."
,action,"Roma in contrast have enjoyed a largely successful campaign thus far and currently sit second in the table, albeit still 10 points adrift of the league leaders."
,action,"Stefano Pioli’s side though have endured an indifferent season overall, with 15 wins from their 25 games so far leaving them sitting in sixth place, 18 points off leaders Juventus."
,action,"Inter come into the game on the back of a 1-0 win over Bologna last time out, with substitute Gabriel Barbosa’s first Serie A goal enough to secure all three points."
,action,Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Serie A match between Inter and Roma at the San Siro.
