,action,"FULL-TIME! Arsenal eventually canter to a 3-1 win over Bournemouth, after what was a very tough first hour at the Emirates. Goals from Sanchez and Walcott wrapped up the three points, with Wilson equalising in the first half from the penalty spot. The away side pushed Wenger's men all the way, but eventually the hosts' quality showed through. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+5',action,"Ramsey sees a shot blocked, before Elneny plays another miscued shot from the periphery of the box. Ibe drives down the left and tries to win a corner from Gabriel, but a deflection takes the ball off the ex-Liverpool winger and behind for an Arsenal goal-kick."
90'+4',action,"Cook launches a long throw into the penalty box from the right-hand side, which is flicked on well by Francis. Mousset is the man who is the benefactor, but Monreal and Koscielny collapse on the youngster. Arter then tries to play a neat back-heel pass to release the same substitute down the right, but the two aren't on the same wavelength and Cech collects."

90'+2',action,We're into the third of three minutes of stoppage time at the Emirates.
90'+1',assist,Assist Olivier Giroud ; Giroud is fed to the right byline and cuts back the pass required to make it 3-1 to the hosts.
90'+1',goal,"Goal Alexis Alejandro Sánchez Sánchez ; GOOOOOOOOAL! SANCHEZ MAKES IT 3-1! The Chile international is picked out in the six-yard box, after great work at the right byline by Giroud. That puts the game to bed, but Sanchez has a very easy finish to make after the French substitute was released into the penalty area by Ozil."
90',action,"Mousset gives the ball away on the edge of the Arsenal box, which sees Xhaka pounce and then attempt to clip a long throughball over the top for Giroud to chase. The Frenchman, however, is beaten to it by Ake. The visitors respond with a counter-attack, which ends in a back-post delivery being headed a long way wide by Mousset."
88',yellow-card,Yellow Card Dan Gosling ; Gosling gets a yellow card for clipping the heels of Xhaka as the Switzerland international looked to spin off his marker and drive down the left.
87',action,"Wide from Giroud! Ramsey bends a curling cross towards the back post, but the French substitute can only stretch enough to stick a leg out and direct the ball a long way beyond the right-hand upright. That was a very tough chance for the Arsenal striker. The hosts maintain their pressure, with Xhaka finding Giroud, but a knockdown from the Frenchman is rattled wide by Ramsey due to a slight deflection."
85',action,"Elneny wins possession back in the middle of the park, which sees Sanchez and Ozil try to combine in the final third. Ake slides in to put some pressure on, which sees the former drag his pass away from the danger zone. Bournemouth try to release Afobe in behind, but the ex-Gunners forward is caught narrowly offside."
83',action,"Giroud is picked out by a cross from the left-hand side, but the Frenchman is put under pressure and then outmuscled by Ake. As a result, the ex-Montpellier man heads a long way wide of the post. Bournemouth respond with a break down their own left, but Mousset's delivery is nodded away by Koscielny."
81',substitution,"; Mousset is given a late chance to try and turn things around for the away side, in what will be only his second appearance of the season for Bournemouth. B. Smith jogs off, which should see the Cherries reshuffle their personnel."
80',yellow-card,Yellow Card Brad Smith ; B. Smith is booked for a very cynical tackle on the left-hand side.
78',action,"Cech makes a good save from close-range, as it appeared that Afobe had the chance to net an equaliser! That would have been a huge goal, and it is a big reminder to Arsenal that their lead is very fragile indeed."
76',substitution,"; Giroud is also introduced for the home side, with Walcott taking his leave after netting what could be the winner."
75',substitution,"; Oxlade-Chamberlain jogs off, with Ramsey given the last 15 minutes to get up to match speed for the Gunners."
75',action,"Ozil sends a cheeky back-heel pass into the path of Oxlade-Chamberlain, after a lovely pass forward from Sanchez. Unfortunately for the ex-Saints midfielder, however, Federici is able to get off his line and claim with some assisting pressure from his recovering defenders."
73',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Harry Arter ; Bournemouth want handball for a pass that is clipped onto Monreal's arm, but the Spain international couldn't get his hand out of the way in that situation. Arter gets a yellow card for dissent in the aftermath."
73',action,"Francis is released down the right-hand side, but the full-back hesitates and allows for Oxlade-Chamberlain to track back, give away a corner, and then clear the resulting set-piece. The Gunners respond with a break, which sees the hosts move from left to right, but an eventual delivery from Walcott is absolutely horrendous. Wenger hasn't been the happiest man in the world today, he thinks that Arsenal have been wasteful at key moments, based on his reactions."
71',substitution,"; Ibe is introduced for the last 20 minutes, with Stanislas limping off with an injury, with the winger having the potential to cause a few problems against tiring full-backs."
69',action,"Xhaka takes aim from long-range, but hammers a terrible shot a long way wide of the left-hand post. There is a stoppage in play, as Stanislas goes down holding his calf, which sees Ibe quickly stripped off and readied for action on the visitors' substitute."
67',action,"Less than half an hour remains in this contest, with Bournemouth trying to start to dominate the ball and the midfield third as they did for a long spell in the first half. Howe will be pleased with how his side have performed on the whole, but they need to step it up a gear."
65',action,"Monreal releases Ozil to the byline, but the Germany international sees a low cross blocked well. Bournemouth respond by keeping the ball and slowing things down a little, as Arsenal have looked a bit brighter since that Walcott goal. Arter tries to find Afobe with a curling cross, but Koscielny rises above the substitute to clear."
63',substitution,"; Wilson takes his leave after a quiet second-half showing, with former Arsenal youngster Benik Afobe getting an opportunity to impress against his former club."
62',yellow-card,Yellow Card Alexis Alejandro Sánchez Sánchez ; Sanchez picks up the first yellow card of the second half.
61',action,"Sanchez is able to drill in a low cross from the left-hand side, but Federici collects ahead of Ozil, with Bournemouth able to break. King gets to the right byline, but the Norway international's drilled cross evades everyone someone. Wenger can't believe what he is seeing. Moments later, Oxlade-Chamberlain sees a low shot blocked by Cook."
59',action,"Sanchez finds Walcott out on the right-hand side, but a deflected cross from the England international is deflected by B. Smith and caught as a result by Federici. Bournemouth head up the other end, and King sees a shot blocked, before the move breaks down when Ake gifts possession away in the midfield third."
57',action,"Arsenal are stroking the ball around nicely at the moment, as Bournemouth need to collect themselves again and try to battle back onto level terms. Xhaka finds Oxlade-Chamberlain, but a terrible pass from the Englishman is cut out easily by B. Smith. The home crowd groans."
55',action,"The referee needs to get involved to calm a few tempers, as Wilson, Gabriel and Mustafi get involved in a physical battle in the right corner. The home side are flowing again now, as Ozil releases Oxlade-Chamberlain down the left at pace, but a curling back-post delivery sails over everybody in the penalty box."
53',assist,"Assist Ignacio Monreal Eraso ; Monreal is able to knock the ball calmly across to the opposite post, allowing for his teammate to have the easiest of finishes."
53',goal,"Goal Theo Walcott ; GOOOOOOOOAL! WALCOTT MAKES IT 2-1! Ozil shows some lovely footwork, before curling a cross towards the back post. Monreal meets it, and guides a square ball towards the back post, which the England international is able to nod home from close-range. What an important goal that could be!"
52',action,"Gabriel makes a good clearance under pressure for Arsenal, with the likes of Ramsey and Giroud already warming up on the touchline for the hosts. King is found in a pocket of space, before A. Smith opens play out to Francis on the right, but a cross from the full-back is hacked away by Koscielny."
50',action,"The home side are streaming forward in attack, as it appears that Wenger's half-time words has the Gunners firing at a much higher intensity. Bournemouth are forced back onto the back foot. Walcott breaks to the right byline, but his cross is blocked, before Mustafi is robbed of possession easily by Gosling."
48',action,"Bournemouth win themselves an early corner on the right-hand side, but Arsenal clear their lines, as Howe's men look to kick on immediately. Arsenal respond with a break down the left, but a back-post cross is lumped away from danger. Sanchez finds Oxlade-Chamberlain in the box, but the ex-Southampton man isn't permitted to turn and shoot."
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half at the Emirates! Arsenal and Bournemouth are level at 1-1, with the away side showing that they can go toe-to-toe with Arsene Wenger's side so far."
,action,"HALF-TIME! A few booes rain down from the Arsenal fans at the end of that first half, but they're directed towards the referee. After Sanchez opened the scoring due to a Cook mistake, Howe's men have equalised due to a controversial penalty that was tucked home by Wilson. All to play for after the interval, but Bournemouth have given a great account of themselves so far."
45'+3',action,"King makes a good block to deny an Oxlade-Chamberlain cross from the right-hand side, with Arsenal maintaining their pressure. Sanchez is picked out on the right-hand side, after a slip in midfield, and B. Smith doesn't close the Chilean down quickly enough. The Arsenal man rattles a shot onto the bar from a tight angle!"
45'+1',action,We're into the first of three minutes of stoppage time.
45',action,"Sanchez is nearly released by a quick ball over the top, but Ake tracks back in to nod a header back to Federici. Arter is given a final warning by the referee, after flying into a reckless tackle on Monreal. He will need to watch his step now."
43',action,"Walcott tries to drill in a cross from the right-hand side, but B. Smith makes a block that concedes a corner. It is swung in, but Ake half-clears, before a back-post second delivery from Xhaka is nodded away by Cook. Bournemouth break, but King and Wilson give the ball away while trying to link up. This game is extremely unforgiving, just one error can see the other team race up the other end on the break."
41',action,"Less than five minutes stand between us and the half-time break, and Arsenal are trying to close the first half with a second goal. Ozil and Sanchez have come into the game a little more in the last five minutes, but the hosts need to try and set up camp in the opposition half to ensure that their key men get on the ball in dangerous areas."
39',action,"Sanchez and Ozil link up well inside the penalty area, but a bobble sits the ball up a little for the former. He tries to take a touch to steady himself before shooting, but it doesn't work, with the ex-Barcelona forward lashing an awful attempt a long way over Federici's bar! Promising signs from Arsenal, at least. Walcott then drills a great cross into the six-yard area, but nobody is on the end of it."
37',action,"Over the top from Elneny! The former Basel midfielder is picked out on the edge of the penalty area, as Francis gives the ball away terribly, but can only lash a first-time effort high and wide of the target. That was a big opportunity for the Gunners to test Federici."
35',action,"King is picked out by a long pass down the right-hand side, but Koscielny covers across to put the ball into touch. Bournemouth are knocking the ball around imperiously, Arsenal can't seem to get a touch for long periods. Ozil has been very quiet, with the away side pressing high to negate the German's impact."
33',action,"The away side look in control at the Emirates, with Arsenal forced to watch the Cherries play them at their own game. Mustafi has to acrobatically turn a cross from the right-hand side away, before a break from the hosts is halted when Ake pulls out the pace to match Walcott out wide. What a start we've had in London!"
31',action,"Xhaka threatens from range, but can't test Federici, as the home side try to get themselves back on the front foot on home soil Bournemouth are stroking the ball around very well, and that early mistake from Cook has been completely forgotten. Howe is feverishly taking down notes on the touchline, but he can be pleased with how his side have responded to going 1-0 down."
29',action,"Good save from Cech! B. Smith is put in behind, after a lovely pass by Arter, but the ex-Liverpool man shoots straight at the near post. The Arsenal goalkeeper parries the ball behind, with Wilson telling his teammate in no uncertain terms that he should have squared that."
27',action,"Ake gives away a free-kick deep on the left-hand side for Bournemouth, but a delivery into the penalty area is nodded to safety and away from the lurking Koscielny. The away side have come right back into this game, and Arsenal's early confidence has been completely sapped."
25',action,"Over the bar from A. Smith! Koscielny gives away a free-kick for a foul on Arter, which is then lifted into the box. Ake knocks a header square across the penalty area, which is met by the out-of-position right-back, but he can only direct a close-range finish above the target! That should be 2-1."
23',penalty-goal,"Penalty Goal Callum Wilson ; GOOOOOOOOOAL! WILSON MAKES IT 1-1! That has been coming, and it's the first time that Bournemouth have actually found the back of the net against the Gunners in history. Cech goes the wrong way, allowing for Wilson to slot home a cool finish. The Arsenal fans aren't happy at all."
22',yellow-card,Yellow Card Shkodran Mustafi ; Mustafi gets a booking for arguing with the penalty decision for Arsenal.
22',action,"PENALTY TO BOURNEMOUTH! Monreal covers across and tries to get goalside of Wilson, with some minor contact sending the visiting striker to the floor. That looks incredibly harsh."
21',action,"Walcott tracks back to deny a cross from the left-hand side by Stanislas, winning the Cherries yet another early set-piece. Ake fails to meet a near-post delivery with an acrobatic volley attempt, before a second cross into the area is nodded away from the danger zone by Mustafi."
20',action,"Bournemouth take a free-kick short, which sees Wilson picks out at the left byline, but a cross from the Englishman is knocked behind for a corner. That set-piece finds B. Smith on the edge of the area, but a shot from the Australian heads wide of the far post with the aid of a deflection. Cech ends a spell of pressure for the visitors by gobbling up an attempted throughball into the penalty area."
18',action,"The home side are stroking the ball around with confidence, and their fans are responding to it well. Bournemouth are on the back foot and both Francis and Cook look like nervous wrecks at the back. This is promising to be any score, as Howe's men have dug themselves a huge hole already."
16',substitution,"; Gabriel is introduced into the Arsenal defence, and goes straight in at right-back as a like-for-like replacement for Debuchy."
15',action,"Half a chance for Wilson! The English striker is picked out by a cross from the right-hand side, but can only direct a header wide of the left-hand post. Debuchy goes down with a hamstring problem, and he will have to make his way off the pitch and down the tunnel."
14',action,"Oxlade-Chamberlain drives to the left byline, and sees a cross blocked at the near post, before Federici fails to deal with another deliery into the box. Arsenal maintain their pressure, which sees Sanchez drive into the penalty box under pressure from Ake, but the referee isn't interested in giving a penalty after the Chile international goes to ground."
12',goal,"Goal Alexis Alejandro Sánchez Sánchez ; GOOOOOOOOAL! SANCHEZ MAKES IT 1-0! What a terrible error from Cook. The Bournemouth defender is given the ball by his goalkeeper, before slotting a scuffed pass back across his area and into the path of the Arsenal striker. That is an absolute gift for the hosts."
10',action,"Walcott tries to drill in a cross from the right-hand side, but Ake is there once again to make an intercept, and then calmly plays his way out of trouble. The Dutchman is looking extremely assured in these early stages. Walcott and Alexis try to combine on the edge of the penalty area, but a flicked pass from the Chilean is gobbled up by Federici."
9',action,"Good block from Ake! A free-kick is worked to the edge of the penalty area, which finds Elneny, but as the Egypt international shoots, the Chelsea loanee is present to keep Arsenal at bay once again. He helped out his goalkeeper from an Ozil shot earlier, and now he has come to Howe's rescue for the second time."
7',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Simon Francis ; Bournemouth get a second yellow card within the opening 10 minutes, as Francis makes a cynical tackle once Oxlade-Chamberlain gets beyond him and almost into the penalty box."
6',action,"Brad Smith gets down the left flank, but Debuchy recovers to make a good sliding challenge. The away side win a corner as a result, but it comes to nothing. Neither side have looked afraid to get forward so far. Ake tries to slot a drilled throughball in behind for Wilson to chase, but Cech is off his line quickly to collect."
4',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Steve Cook ; Cook gets a yellow card for a terribly late tackle on Sanchez, as the Chile international looked to scamper down the left-hand side. He can't have any complaints, the foul ended a promising move for the hosts."
3',action,"Adam Smith goes close with a shot from just outside the box, but Cech is happy to watch the ball flash past his near post. The hosts then respond, as Ozil gets half a chance deep within the Bournemouth area, but Federici is able to make a smart stop. End-to-end stuff in the very early minutes in the capital!"

,action,"TEAM NEWS: Jack Wilshere is unavailable for the away side as a result of the terms of his loan contract, meaning that Dan Gosling and Harry Arter will be key in the middle of the park - especially due to Andrew Surman's injury absence.
