,action,"And that will do it as Dortmund clinch a vital win to end a sequence of draws. Aubameyan struck the only goal of the game in the first half, and the home side rode that all the way to third place in a packed house behind Bayern and Leipzig in the table. The visitors fail to take advantage of Bayern's slip up against Schalke and are four points off the pace. That's it from us, thanks for tuning in!"
90'+4',yellow-card,Yellow Card Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ; Aubameyang has been booked late on.
90'+4',action,"GOAL RULED OUT! Nearly a fairytale equaliser for Martinez, who ghosts past the defensive line to poke a low finish home, but the flag is up to cut his celebrations short! It was the narrowest of decisions."
90'+2',action,"The ball is cleared off the line and Dortmund have another corner, which they hold near the flag. Second remain for the home side to see out for what would be their ninth victory in the league this season."
90',action,"This will do for Dortmund. They continue to pass the ball in the opposition half and near the corner flag. Leipzig are being urged forward by their manager, but they look absolutely exhausted."
88',action,"ANOTHER ONE GOES BEGGING FOR REUS! He could have had a hat-trick in the second half had he been more clinical. He's put through on goal again, but slides his finish right at the keeper."
86',action,"If this result stays the same, Dortmund will move up to third place, eight points behind Leipzig. However, Hoffenheim, Koln, Frankfurt and Hertha will all have something to say as they, along with BVB, are separated by only three points from third to seventh."
85',substitution,; Substitution Marcel Schmelzer Felix Passlack
84',action,"THAT SHOULD HAVE WRAPPED IT UP! Reus is put through on goal and has Compper struggling to keep up. He winds up a low finish, but slides it across the face of goal and out."
81',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Marvin Compper ; Compper gets booked for having a word with the referee. That's his fifth yellow card of the season, meaning that he'll miss the next match against Hamburg next Saturday."
80',substitution,; Palacios Martinez heads on to replace Kaiser.
79',action,"Poulsen fouls Sokratis, who still goes down rather easily, then executes a nimble roll to get back to his feet. As you were."
77',substitution,; Guerreiro has been withdrawn and on comes Ginter.
77',action,"You really have to give the Dortmund defence credit for eliminating the Leipzig threat in the second half. The visitors have badly missed the likes of Werner, their attack has been blunt."
75',action,"Not a whole lot happening on the pitch at the moment. Leipzig are really struggling to create opportunities, and Dortmund will be quite happy to let the game get scrappy in the middle of the park."
73',substitution,"; Selke departs, and the promising Oliver Burke enters the fray."
72',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Dayotchanculle Upamecano ; Upamecano tries to illegally break a shield from Reus, making a dent on his calf, and earning himself a yellow card."
71',action,"All the best Dortmund opportunities have come down the right-hand side. Pusilic has picked up where Dembele left off, and another great run and cross finds Reus for a shot that's blocked by his own team-mate."
69',action,"Dortmund still aren't home and dry yet. Despite their one-goal lead and general dominance of the second half, all it takes is one attack from the visiting side. BVB will desperately want to avoid yet another draw."
67',action,"Ilsanker stabs the ball out right for Kaiser, who tries to angle a cross in towards the near post, but Burki is in position to make the catch. Finally something for him to get involved with in the second half."
66',substitution,"; Khedira has been withdrawn, and on comes Dayot Upamekano."
65',action,"Not much going right for Reus in this game as he's caught offside after falling behind the development of a play. Meanwhile, Leipzig look ready to make their first change of the game."
63',action,"Pulisic makes an impact almost immediately, running onto Reus' pass and dinking a cross for Aubameyang that Compper needed to get to. Moments later, the young American sends another delivery just over the head of his striker."
61',substitution,"; Dembele was beeing looked at by the physios, and it appears that Tuchel will go ahead with a substitution, replacing the wide man with Pulisic."
60',action,"SHOULD HAVE DONE BETTER! Aubameyang has a clear sight on goal after winning the battle for pace with Compper, before cutting inside the defender and firing on goal, but his finish lacks power and is saved."
58',action,"Nearly an hour gone and we've not seen much from Leipzig, apart from that one Ilsanker run. Dortmund are winning the ball in good areas and it appears only a matter of time before they break through again."
56',action,"A long ball out of the back is helped on by Aubameyang, and Reus follows it to the byline. He gambles that someone would make a run into the area, stabbing it across, but there's no takers."
54',action,"Reus feeds Dembele and continues his run into the box. Aubameyang is also making a move inside the area, and the presence of both passing options confuses Dembele, who slides it right between them and into the keeper's arms."
52',action,"HORRENDOUS MISS! Leipzig hopelessly appeal for a penalty as Aubameyang breaks, storming down the right flank and squaring to Reus at the top of the box. He evades his marker, but stabs his finish a couple of feet wide."
50',action,"Much better from Selke, who skips past his initial opponent, then takes too long to pick out a pass for a team-mate, leading to an interception in the six-yard area. Energetic start to the second half."
48',action,"Leipzig are not quite sure how to deal with Dortmund at the moment, as the wide man is tumbled on the edge of the area, but the referee deems it a fair challenge by Compper."
46',action,Off we go again.
,action,"And that will wrap it up from Signal Iduna Park for now as Aubameyang has sent the home side into a half-time advantage. It's not been the attacking exhibition that one might have expected, but there's been enough to suggest that the scoring may not yet be done. Stay tuned for the restart soon."
45',action,"Great defending from Piszczek to win the ball off Keita out wide, and moments later, Dortmund nearly break through Dembele down the right again, but Ilsanker, this time, comes in with a proper challenge."
43',action,"Leipzig are stuttering to end this half, as Selke runs out of steam when chasing the ball towards the byline, leading to a goal-kick. We've only got a few minutes before half-time now."
41',action,"Gulacsi is a lucky boy, as a back-pass from Compper puts him under pressure, and his clearance is deflected by Dembele straight up into the air. Dortmund can't profit from that mistake though."
39',action,"Dortmund almost always go on to clinch all three points if they get the first goal in a game. In fact, last week against Mainz was the first time that they failed to see a game out after opening the scoring."
37',action,"He only scored one goal in four games prior to that point, but Aubameyang has ended his drought and sent Dortmund into the lead. They've just about been the better side - what will Leipzig's response be?"
35',assist,Assist Ousmane Dembélé ; World-class assist from him.
35',goal,"Goal Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ; TREMENDOUS OPENER! Dembele sizzles down the right, skipping past Stefan Ilsanker, then skinning Orban before curling a wonderful ball in that Aubameyang can't help but head home!"
34',action,"MUCH BETTER FROM DORTMUND! Dembele shows real danger to beat Marcel Halstenberg to the byline. He swings in a great cross that Aubameyang attacks, but he heads it over!"
33',action,"Marvin Compper does well to defend Aobameyang down the left initially, but then can't stop the striker from getting in a cross at the second attempt. It's headed away from Reus by Orban."
32',action,"More often than not, against other sides, you'd pick out Dortmund and Leipzig as two of the most entertaining sides in the country. However, they seem to cancel each other out whenever they play."
31',action,"The tempo of the game has slowed down somewhat with regular intervention from the referee, after some rough play in midfield. There's been no real chances, other than perhaps that earlier Aubameyang break."
28',action,"Weigl has dished out one or two rough challenges, all on Keita, but now he gets a taste of his own medicine. He runs right into Keita, getting an inadvertent blow to the chops, and is down on the deck."
26',action,"Orban races towards the back post and tries to glance a first-time header back to Poulsen, but fails to make it happen. He had more time than he realised there, he could have probably touched that down!"
24',action,"Dortmund are among the first teams in action when the Champions League resumes, as they travel to Portugal on Valentine's Day to face Benfica in the first leg of their round of 16 tie."
22',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Bernardo Fernandes da Silva Junior ; It's all getting a bit feisty at the moment, with a few rough challenges coming one after the other. The worst of those came from Bernardo, who tripped Schmelzer, and is booked."
20',action,"Some good attacking options on the bench for Dortmund in the form of Gotze, Andre Schurrle and Shinji Kagawa."
17',action,"Willi Orban makes a vital block on Marcel Schmelzer, who latched onto a terrific pass out of the back from Sokratis and was about to ping in the cross. Dortmund are looking more dangerous now."
15',action,"Durm and Weigl try to exchange quick passes near the touchline, but Rani Khedira tugs back the Dortmund man from behind, giving away another free-kick. The referee has been a busy man so far."
13',action,"Poor from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the end. The striker had the ball and space to run into after skipping past his first opponent. He could have shot, but tried to pick out Ousmane Dembele instead, asking too much of the wide man."
12',action,"Amid a deafaning chorus of whistles and jeers, Leipzig captain Kaiser takes the free-kick, but it's flicked to the centre and cleared by the home side. Hang on, as it looks like they can break..."
10',action,"Keita appeared to be dispossessed by Julian Weigl, but a belated whistle from the referee signals a foul instead of a throw-in. The deep delivery comes to nothing initially, but then Yakob Poulsen wins a much more dangerous set-piece on the corner of the box."
7',action,Naby Keita fouls Bartra right after the defender clears his lines. He gets a talking to from the referee. He will be a crucial player for the visitors tonight if they're to get a result against BVB.
5',action,"Bartra wins an initial header, but Lukasz Piszczek makes an absolute meal of the resulting clearance, falling over himself and handling the ball, which he's lucky that the referee didn't spot."
3',action,"There was definitely an opening on Dortmund's first attack of the game, but Marco Reus carelessly strayed offside. Leipzig know that the home side are always a menace on the break."
1',action,Off we go!
,action,"A flu bug has swept through the Leipzig camp, knocking Timo Werner, Marcel Sabitzer and Diego Demme out of this game, while Emil Forsberg is serving a suspension. Rani Khedira, Dominik Kaiser and Davie Selke are all recalled."
,action,"Marc Bartra beats out Matthias Ginter to a starting berth, while Mario Gotze remains on the bench for the third straight game. Erik Durm is also in the XI, with Gonzalo Castro missing from the squad."
,action,"Leipzig subs: Coltorri, Schmitz, Upamecano, Burke, Strauss, Wojtkowski, Palacios Martinez."
,action,"Leipzig (4-4-2): Gulacsi; Bernardo, Orban, Compper, Halstenberg; Kaiser, Keita, Khedira, Ilsanker; Poulsen, Selke."

,action,"Dortmund (4-3-3): Burki; Piszczek, Sokratis, Bartra, Schmelzer; Durm, Weigl, Guerreiro; Dembele, Aubameyang, Reus."
,action,"Dortmund have dropped a lot of points recently, drawing four of their last five league games. However, only Bayern have scored more than their 38 goals this season, and Thomas Tuchel is the only manager to claim a win against Carlo Ancelotti in the Bundesliga this term."
,action,"Leipzig are where Dortmund wish they were, challenging Bayern for the title. Tonight's guests lost to the Bavarians just before the winter break, but responded with back-to-back wins to keep things tight."
,action,"Hello and welcome to our live commentary of the Bundesliga match between Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig at Signal Iduna Park. Bayern's draw against Schalke gives the visitors a chance to close the gap at the top to a point, while the home side want to get back into the top four."
