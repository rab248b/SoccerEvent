,action,Sunderland delivered a spirited performance but offered little going forward. Their best opportunity of the game came when Defoe hit the crossbar but moments later Lukaku was able to double the host's lead. Moyes now just has one win in nine and Sunderland have not won consecutive away games since 2014. The visitors are quickly running out of time to claw away from the bottom and face a tough test next week as they host Manchester City.
,action,The final score ends 2-0 to Everton as the Toffees extend their unbeaten run to nine games. Koeman's men now have six clean sheets in their last nine games and have collected the most points out of every Premier League team in 2017. Their European challenge and vie for sixth place remains well and truly alive.
90'+3',action,"Everton have a go of keep-ball before Mirallas hits an audacious attempt from some distance, though the shot is always rising and sails well over the bar. Sunderland have a goal-kick but it is far too late for the visitors to salvage something from this afternoon. A disappointing return for David Moyes indeed."
90'+2',action,Gueye finds Mirallas who tries to pick Lukaku with a tremendous cross across field but it just escapes the striker. Sunderland regain possession and search for another forward. The visitors have delivered a spirited performance this afternoon but it's clear they are seriously struggling for goals.
90',substitution,; An injured Jones makes way for former Liverpool boy Javier Manquillo.
89',action,Sunderland are in the wars this afternoon as Jones' low head meets Gueye's high foot and the right-back receives a cut head. The game is able to continue while the defender receives treatment on the sidelines. There are set to be four additional minutes here on Merseyside.
87',action,The Belgian is back on his feet and able to continue. It's now just a case of running down the lock for the hosts. Lukaku and Valencia combine as the latter races into the box and looks to chip it over Pickford but it's a tremendous save from the young 'keeper who timed it just right. The 22-year-old looked to get the ball rolling straight away as he throws it out immediately but the visitors' counter attacking is poor.
85',action,Baines is forced to put the ball out of play as Januzaj is down clutching his face. Another injury is the last thing David Moyes needs. Defoe encourages his teammate to come to ground as Sunderland really need the United loanee on his feet.
83',substitution,; Barkley leaves the pitch to a brilliant reception from the Everton faithful as he is replaced by James McCarthy.
82',action,Sunderland will be kicking themselves after missing that golden chance to equalise just moments before Everton double their lead. There is surely no way back for David Moyes' men now?
80',goal,Goal Romelu Lukaku Menama ; GOAL! Everton double their lead through Lukaku! The visitors now have a mountain to climb after Lukaku races clear and dinks it over Pickford.
80',assist,Assist Kevin Mirallas ; Mirallas knows Lukaku is deadly in such situations and did well to pick out his fellow countryman.
79',substitution,; Gibson sees the final action of the afternoon as he makes way for academy product George Honeyman.
79',substitution,"; Borini, who has been dire this afternoon, is hauled off in place of Wahbi Khazri."
78',action,"CLOSE! HOW DID THAT NOT GO IN!? Januzaj leads the counter before Defoe dances inside the box and gets shot away but it's hit too high and it ricochets off the bar. The striker is normally so reliable, just a few inches lower and would be the equaliser the visitors so desperately seek."
77',yellow-card,Yellow Card Bryan Oviedo ; Oviedo is reprimanded for a reckless challenge on Gueye.
75',action,SAVE! It's an excellent save from Pickford and that is why he is dubbed as England's future number one! Gueye fools Oviedo and is able to play on Lukaku who unleashes a fierce shot at goal from close distance. Pickford was just able to palm it away and the visitors can momentarily breathe a sigh of relief.
74',action,"Valencia is waiting in the box but Oviedo makes a decent interception before the Blues win it back. Schneiderlin spots Lukaku who turns well and hits a low drive at Pickford who is able to smother it. 15-minutes remaining here at Goodison, can Sunderland find a way back?"
72',action,Borini fails to track Coleman and the Irishman is able to put in a decent delivery from the edge of the box. The cross escapes Valencia and Barkley's effort is sky-high. The midfielder is claiming it went out off an opposition player but the referee isn't interested.
70',substitution,; Tom Davies makes way for Enner Valencia as Koeman makes his second change of the afternoon.
69',action,Gibson searches for Defoe in the box but the striker us under enormous pressure from Williams and Coleman is able to hit it away. Everton are certainly playing dangerously and Koeman's troops must remember they are only leading by one goal. Barkley finds Mirallas who is in an excellent position but his effort is just wide of goal.
67',action,Gueye drives it on but after good tracking from Ndong the goal scorer fluffs his lines. Pickford takes the goal kick and after a tussle in the middle of the park Lukaku is pulled up for a challenge on Kone who rakes into the centre-back's calf. The away end are still in fine voice and are keen to show their support for David Moyes.
65',action,Schneiderlin picks out Coleman who spots Barkley but Sunderland manage to clear it. Williams spots Larsson making a run down the wing and is able to cut it out for a throw. Sunderland try the other side of the field but Gueye is also well alert.
63',action,"Moyes will be happy with how his troops have performed in the second-half thus far. No heads have dropped and they have not yet slipped further behind, though they are lacking creativity going forward and Defoe has little to work with. Schneiderlin is working tireless for the hosts and is at the centre of everything, he executes an attack but the ball is met by O'Shea before Lukaku and the hosts have a corner. Fortunately for Sunderland, the corner fails to cause any trouble."
60',substitution,; Lookman is replaced by Kevin Mirallas who was coincidentally signed by David Moyes.
60',action,"Schneirderlin picks out Davies who chests it on for Barkley. Davies then bursts forward and receives it back, he looks for Coleman but miss hits the cross and it's out for a Sunderland goal-kick. The game has slowed down an awful lot as we pass the hour mark here at Goodison."
58',action,"Larsson whips a corner into the box, with Kone the target again, but Joel is able to catch. The visitors are struggling to create much in open play and their set-pieces leave a lot to be desired. At the other end of the pitch Barkley drives in a free-kick before Gueye's strike is blocked by Januzaj."
56',action,"O'Shea wins a free-kick on the halfway. Gibson takes it looking to pick out Kone, the tallest Sunderland player in the box, but the set-piece is way off and out for a goal-kick. The visitor's set-pieces have been way below par this afternoon."
53',action,Baines complains to the referee that he was fouled by Jones but Atwell is having none of it and waves away the left-backs protests. Everton seem to have a little direction in the second-half and a number of substitutes are warming up on the touchline. Will Koeman soon make a change?
51',action,Everton pass it around their own half as they look to find their tempo. They finally manage to make a break but Lukaku is under heavy pressure from O'Shea and Pickford is able to gather the Belgian's strike.  The forward is just one goal away from reaching Duncan Ferguson's record of 60 Premier League goals for the Toffees.
49',action,Januzaj and Ndong combine before Borini finds himself in space. The Italian goes for goal but it's blocked by Williams and out for a corner. Januzaj drives it into well but no-one can get on the end of Jones' flick on. Better from Sunderland.
47',action,Ndong spots Borini and Defoe waiting in the box but Defoe struggles to control it and it's out by a blue shirt. The corner is easily dealt with by Everton but Defoe attempts a fierce strike which ricochets off Williams. The visitors have certainly started this half determined to pull one back.
46',action,Defoe gets underway for the second-half...
,action,Sunderland will be disappointed as they conceded just five minutes before the break and up until the opener they did well to contain a strong Everton side. Though the host's attacking prowess proved just too much for the visitors and they find themselves trailing. It's a huge 45-minutes coming up for David Moyes' men who need every point they can get as they fight for their top-flight status.
,action,"Everton head into the break leading 1-0. It's a deserved lead for the hosts who have had the better share of the chances. They dominated the majority of the game and despite Sunderland finding their swagger, the Toffees managed to prise their defence open. It was a beautiful team goal from the hosts and a hell of a hit from Gueye who looks delighted with himself as he heads down the tunnel."
45',action,"Defoe, of all players, gives away a freekick. The ball ends up at the feet of Davies who has recently burst onto the scene at Goodison and it's clear to see why. The youngster unleashes a feature shot which is on the wrong side of the post by just inches. Everton could easily be 2-0 up."
44',action,"Kone is forced into a mistake and Everton win a throw. The Toffees take a minute to pass the ball around the halfway line before Barkley wrong foots Gibson and shoots from just outside the area. It's goal bound but Pickford is able to get a hand to it and fortunately for the visitors, the corner is soon cleared."
42',action,Everton have certainly found their rhythm again following that opener and are playing at a very high tempo. Sunderland are struggling with the pace of the game and they must make sure that do not collapse as they have previously this season after going behind. The away fans are still in fine voice as they to support their players.
40',assist,Assist Séamus Coleman ; Coleman did tremendously well to pick of Gueye and it was played in beautifully from the Irish international.
40',goal,Goal Idrissa Gana Gueye ; GOAL! Everton lead! It was a beautiful move from the hosts. Davies executed the move with an excellent crossfield move. Gueye was well spotted by Coleman and passed the ball into the back of the net with a hell of a hit.
38',action,"It's a huge let off the visitors as Lukaku races forward alone having escaped O'Shea's clutches, though the forward is flagged offside. It was a close call from the linesman but one Sunderland will be thankful for. The visitors need to be more vigilant in such situations."
35',yellow-card,Yellow Card Darron Gibson ; Gibson is first player to be booked this afternoon for a needless foul on Lookman.
34',action,"Everton win a free-kick as Larsson clumsily catches the heel of Barkley. Baines, notorious for his set piece magic, drives it into the box but Williams' header isn't met with any real direction and Pickford is able to catch it. It's a poor clearance from the keeper and Everton regain possession immediately."
33',action,It's cleverly worked into the box by Ndong but Borini is penalised for bringing Funes Mori to ground in the Everton box. Sunderland are playing with more confidence now but Everton seem happy to soak up the pressure. Moyes will be happy with how hard his troops have worked thus far.
31',action,"Januzaj wins a freekick from Baines but it's wasteful from the visitors as Larsson puts far too much height and pace on the set piece and Jones, who seems to be the target, has no chance of getting his head to it. Sunderland can't afford to be so wasteful with such opportunities. Gibson picks out Borini who plays to Jaunzaj but it's quickly dealt with by a blue shirt."
28',action,Lukaku speeds away from Kone before Ndong wins it back from Barkley. Sunderland have made a better account of themselves in the past few minutes but are still struggling to contain Everton in the attacking third. Ndong wins a freekick following a nasty challenge from Lookman as the youngster catches the Gabon man's heel.
25',action,Borini struggles to keep possession 25-yards from Everton's goal but manages to have a half hearted attempt which bobbles well wide. Januzaj manages to get away from Lookman and races forward but the midfielder shows Funes Mori too much of the ball and the Everton man is able to clear.
24',action,Everton are showing great patience in possession as we pass the halfway point of the first-half. Barkley plays it through to Gueye in the box but Oviedo is the Black Cats' saviour yet again. Gueye is becoming some what of a nuisance to the visitors' defence and they must be aware of his presence.
22',action,Everton take a moment to pass it around their own half as they plan another route forward. Gueye races forward as Schneiderlin spots Baines making the run but a joint effort from Oviedo and Borini is enough to clear the danger. Moments later Januzaj is pulled up for a clear barge on Baines.
20',action,Jones loses it near his own box as Gueye punishes the right-back's mistake. Pickford knows little about it bit he just manages to keep it out before smothering the resulting corner. A huge let off for Jones who can't afford a repeat of that mistake.
18',action,Ndong has it into the box and tries to hit into the centre for Defoe but it's well defended by the hosts. Borini has it back and plays it to Oviedo who goes for a decent strike just outside of the area. His effort is narrowly deflected before the corner is swiftly dealt with despite Borini's acrobatic attempt of an overhead kick.
15',action,Barkley takes it short but it's terribly worked as Lookman skies it over the bar. Moyes needs to address his troops to the worrying fact they keep leaving Lukaku unmarked as such a mistake will lead to a goal sooner or later. The hosts are certainly dominating this afternoon.
14',action,"Coleman drives it into the box but Larsson is well alert and clears his lines competently. Moments later Borini is a very lucky boy as he brings Coleman down on the very of the box. The Everton man waited to go to ground before falling inside the area, it was well spotted by Stuart Atwell but now Sunderland have a tricky set-piece to deal with..."
12',action,Sunderland love causing their own downfall as they continue to put themselves under extra pressure with rash decision making and sloppy passes. Januzaj is struggling in his defensive role as Everton take a corner and takes a swipe at the ball which fails to clear. Thankfully for the loanee Lukaku skims it just wide.
10',action,Borini does tremendously well to track from the left of the field to the right and wins a corner off Funes Mori. Larsson whips it into the box but it's away as far as Gibson who plays it to Ndong before Everton are able to clear and race forward on the counter. Barkley tries to pick out Davies before conceding a throw as the visitors struggle to get back out of their own half.
8',action,Baines has another go but it's any easy save for Pickford who aims for Defoe with his goalkick but the striker has to go it alone and has no chance against the imposing Everton backline. Sunderland look as though they've gone with one up top and a five man midfield.
7',action,Sunderland are very much on the back foot already this afternoon and are struggling to clear their lines for more than a few seconds. And Pickford gets incredibly lucky! Januzaj is caught out by Baines and it's a great ball in to Lookman who is unlucky not to score. Pickford went to ground far too early and was just able to hold it.
5',action,Coleman is making a dangerous run forward but Oviedo spots the danger and brings his former teammate to ground. Barkely takes the freekick which is in between the corner flag and the box but it comes to nothing. Lukaku looks so put across the face of goal but Larsson puts the ball out for a corner which is put out for another. This time it's well cleared by the visitors. It's ben all Everton in the opening five minutes in Goodison.
2',action,Coleman plays it into the box for Lookman but Billy Jones is able to get there first and put it out for a corner. Lukaku is lurking but he's carefully watched by Gibson and Schneiderlin puts it out for a goal kick. Some early pressure from the Blues.
1',action,Everton get us underway this afternoon...
,action,"David Moyes has failed to name an unchanged side in over 60 matches and today is no exception. There’s two changes to the starting 11 that lost to Southampton as Jason Denayer misses out through illness whilst Vito Mannone’s absence is unknown as Jordan Pickford and Fabio Borini both return to the starting line-up. It’s Pickford’s first game back after suffering a tricky knee injury, Moyes will be delighted that the highly rated youngster is fit again as his distribution is streets ahead of that of Mannone. Meanwhile, Darron Gibson and Bryan Oviedo both start to face their former club having left just last month."
,action,Ronaldo Koeman has named an unchanged side from the team who drew a stalemate away to Middlesborough. It’s a huge milestone for Leighton Baines as he notches his 300th Premier League appearance for Everton. Sunderland will be particularly watchful of Lukaku who has been declared fit in time to face the club he grabbed a hat-trick against earlier this season.
,action,"Subs: Mika, Manquillo, Lescott, Honeyman, Khazri, Love, Gooch"
,action,"Sunderland: Pickford, O'Shea, Kone, Jones, Ndong, Gibson, Larsson, Oviedo, Borini, Januzaj, Defoe."
,action,"Subs: Stekelenburg, Jagielka, Barry, Valencia, Holgate, Mirallas, McCarthy."
,action,"Everton: Joel, Coleman, Williams, Funes, Mori, Baines, Schneiderlin, Gueye, Barkley, Davies, Lookman, Lukaku."
,action,TEAM NEWS
,action,"In the last three meetings between these two sides there has been a total of 14 goals so if history is anything to go by. we’re in for a real treat. Sunderland have won just two away games all season and Moyes will be keen to get one over on his old stomping ground but the blues will be determined not to let that happen. That said, Everton have last two of their last three meetings against Sunderland at Goodison."
,action,"Sunderland visit Merseyside today desperate for three points. It’s a poor week for Sunderland in terms of PR with the Wearsiders receiving a host of criticism for announcing staff redundancies just days after the players arrive back from an all expenses paid team bonding trip to New York. But will the trip have worked? The next ninety minutes will tell us all we need to know. Despite thrashing Crystal Palace 4-0 and scoring three goals in five minutes at Selhurst Park, Moyes’ boys reverted back to their normal selves as they hosted Southampton in their last run out and received a 4-0 hammering. A point today would be a huge result for the visitors as they have a tough run of games coming up and need as many on board as possible if they are escape relegation yet again."
,action,The hosts welcome former manager David Moyes and his stragglers Sunderland today. Despite an 11-year tenure at Goodison Park the Scot is unlikely to get a good reception from the Everton faithful having left the Toffees to manage Manchester United in 2013. A win for Everton would take them just five points behind sixth placed United as Ronald Koeman and his troops battle for a Europa League spot. The Toffees have lost just one game all season and will look to extend their unbeaten league run of eight games to nine today.
