,action,"Thanks for joining our commentary this evening. Until next time, goodbye."
,action,"Osasuna will look back at Roberto Torres' first-half penalty miss with huge regret. That spurned opportunity took the wind out of their sails, and they barely laid a glove on the visitors after that. Joaquin Caparros has a huge job on his hands to save his side from relegation."
,action,"Atletico Madrid end a run of back-to-back defeats in LaLiga by beating Osasuna 3-0 here this afternoon. Diego Simeone's men took control towards the end of the first half and never relinquished their grip thanks to goals from Diego Godin, Kevin Gameiro and Yannick Carrasco's late strike."
,action,FULL-TIME: OSASUNA 0-3 ATLETICO MADRID
90'+3',action,The referee ends the contest.
90',goal,Goal Yannick Ferreira Carrasco ; GOAL!!!! Carrasco wraps up the game for Atletico as he seizes on a mistake from Unai Garcia before surging into the box and firing his low strike past Nauzet. A clinical finish from the Belgian.
90',action,There will be three minutes of added time.
89',action,"SHOTS! Causic sees his effort blocked, while De las Cuevas scuffs his strike. Imanol Garcia hits his effort straight into Lucas and the ball is deflected into the feet of Causic back on the edge. He has space and time, but can only fire his effort over the bar."
87',action,"Osasuna come again down the left and De las Cuevas sends another cross into the box, but this time Gimenez rises and heads clear the danger. The winger has made an impact of sorts since coming on for the home side."
86',action,"De las Cuevas does well to raid down the left and send a threatening cross to the back post, but Imanol Garcia's header is poor and fails to threaten the net."
84',substitution,; Partey replaces Griezmann in the dying minutes.
82',action,"The defensive performance from Atletico bar the concession of a penalty early in the contest has been excellent. Other than his stop to deny Torres, Oblak has had to do almost nothing this afternoon."
81',action,"Atletico have been extremely organised at the back this afternoon. There's just no way through for the home side, despite their improved amount of possession over the last 10 minutes."
79',action,"PENALTY SHOUT! Carrasco claims for a penalty against Unai Garcia as he tries to lift a ball over the top to Griezmann, but the referee dismisses his claims."
78',action,"It's all a bit too comfortable for Atletico at the moment. The home side are trying to probe, but have lacked the quality needed even to look like creating a clear-cut chance in the second half."
75',action,"Oier surges through the middle of the Atletico midfield and he pokes a pass through looking for Riviere's run, but it takes a deflection off Gimenez and Oblak is able to gather ahead of the Osasuna striker."
73',substitution,; Berenguer makes way for De las Cuevas.
72',action,Tiago attempts to stop Riviere from bursting forward down the left and although he wins the ball the striker inadvertently catches him with his boot as they fall to the ground. Painful one for the veteran midfielder.
71',substitution,; Saul replaces Gameiro for the final 20 minutes.
70',action,"Atletico attempt to keep the pressure on with a series of corners from the right, but Osasuna keep them at bay. Simeone will still be raging with the decision not to award a penalty for that blatant handball by Oier."
68',action,"OFF THE LINE! Juanfran raids down the right and fires the ball across the face of goal, although there is no Atletico shirt to tuck it home. Tiago fires it back across from the left flank, but Oier is there on the line to clear it away. There's more than a suspicion of handball there, but the referee missed the call."
66',substitution,; Carrasco comes off the bench to replace Correa.
64',action,"Torres and Berenguer attempt to link up in the final third for the home side, but the latter takes a heavy touch and Godin simply shields the ball back to Oblak."
63',action,"Atletico are in their comfort zone here. There is little to no pressure on them at the back, while their midfielders are able to pass and move freely in the middle of the park."
61',action,"Godin almost allows Riera to seize on his backpass to Oblak, but fortunately for the defender the keeper races off his line to boot it clear."
58',action,"Berenguer collects the ball in a threatening position, but opts to send his pass out wide to Clerc rather than drive forward. The ball goes out for a goal-kick as Juanfran boxes the Osasuna left-back out, wasting the opening."
57',substitution,; Kenan is withdrawn for Riviere.
56',action,"Koke almost releases the run of Gameiro over the top of the Osasuna defence, but the ball just skips off the surface and allows Nauzet to gather."
55',action,Unai Garcia has to be on the spot to head Griezmann's attempted lob over the back four. The defender reads the danger well to head clear with Gameiro lurking.
53',action,Atletico are taking the pace out of the game to stifle Osasuna's attempts to rally. Koke and Gabi are doing their utmost to retain possession in the middle of the park.
51',action,"Tiago uses all his experience under pressure deep in his own territory to draw a foul from Imanol Garcia, although Clerc was also vying to put a foot in."
50',action,"Kenan runs across to the left flank and he sends a dangerous ball across the face of goal, but it just evades Riera at the near post."
48',action,Osasuna have responded well since the break and are making attempts to put the Atletico backline under pressure in the early stages of the half.
46',substitution,; Imanol Garcia replaces Tano at the break for the home side.
,action,We're back underway in this LaLiga clash.
,action,"Joaquin Caparros' men would rue that missed opportunity as Godin made them pay in the 36th minute, while 60 seconds later Gameiro doubled the visitors' advantage. Osasuna have a lot of work ahead of them if they are turn this match around in the second half."
,action,"Atletico lead Osasuna 2-0 at the break thanks to goals from Diego Godin and Kevin Gameiro. The home side could have gone ahead in the early stages of the match, but Roberto Torres saw his penalty saved by Jan Oblak."

45',action,The referee brings the first half to an end.

42',action,"Clerc has to cover ground quickly on the flank to stop Gameiro breaking in behind. He stops the run, but can only concede a corner."
40',action,"Simeone will be delighted with his side's display in the final third. They have not had many opportunities, but have been clinical to take a two-goal lead."
39',action,Osasuna have punished for their penalty miss and due to their lapses of concentration at the back they now have a huge task to turn this match around.
37',assist,"Assist Ángel Martín Correa ; Correa releases Gameiro's run with a delightful lofted pass over the top of the Osasuna defence, resulting in the second goal."
37',goal,Goal Kevin Gameiro ; GOALL!!!!! Atletico take just another minute to double their advantage as Gameiro finds the net. Correa releases his run with a ball over the top and the forward makes no mistake firing his strike past Nauzet.
36',assist,"Assist Jorge Resurrección Merodio ; Koke sends his corner into a dangerous area of the box and is rewarded by Godin, collecting an assist."
36',goal,Goal Diego Roberto Godín Leal ; GOAL!!! Godin rises highest in the box and above three Osasuna defenders he generates enough power on his headed effort to send the ball past Nauzet into the bottom corner.
35',action,Atletico turn the screw on the left flank and their pressure yields a corner that will be taken by Koke.
32',action,"CHANCE! Griezmann wins the ball in the middle of the park and slides an incisive pass to Correa to put him through on goal. The Argentine attempts to slot his strike past Nauzet, but the keeper makes a fine save to keep it out."
31',yellow-card,"Yellow Card José María Giménez de Vargas ; Gimenez wipes out Berenguer after the ball goes out of play, resulting in a booking for the defender."
30',action,"The home side attempt a training-ground routine from the set-piece as Torres picks out Causic who volleys at goal from the edge of the box. However, his effort is blocked, but it wouldn't have mattered anyway as Kenan was penalised for a foul on Gimenez."
29',action,Osasuna sustain a period of possession in the final third and Clerc sends a decent cross towards the near post that Godin can only slice behind for a corner.
27',action,"Kenan gets in behind the Atletico defence and fends off the challenge of Gimenez. His attempted pass to Riera is blocked, while Torres comes to help out, but sees his cross turned behind for a corner."
25',action,Juanfran knocks a poor cross in from the right that is cleared with ease by Garcia. Then on the left flank Lucas' attempted cross into the area hits the gloves of Nauzet. Griezmann and Gameiro are being starved of service at the moment.
23',action,"There's not much tempo to the game at the moment, which will suit the home side out of the two outfits. Atletico are trying to build from the back, but space is proving to be tight inside the Osasuna box."
22',yellow-card,Yellow Card Goran Čaušić ; Causic goes from victim to perpertrator as he wipes out Gabi on a surge forward.
21',yellow-card,Yellow Card Tiago Cardoso Mendes ; Tiago goes into the book for lunging over the top of the ball and catching Causic.
19',action,"CHANCE! Osasuna clear the first ball into the box behind for a corner. The second delivery from Koke is more accurate and Gimenez rises to head at goal, but he can only direct his effort straight at Nauzet."
18',action,Gameiro does down under pressure from Garcia and the referee awards the visitors a free-kick. Koke is standing over the ball 35 yards from goal...
16',action,"How costly will that miss be from Torres? It was such a poor spot-kick, letting the visitors off the hook."
15',action,"Torres almost gets himself in trouble as he tries too hard to win the ball back, fouling Torres and then voices his displeasure at the decision to the referee."

14',missed-penalty,"Missed Penalty Roberto Torres Morales ; MISS! Torres takes the spot-kick, but hits a poor effort. His strike is not far enough into the corner and is at a comfortable height for Oblak to save."
14',action,PENALTY TO OSASUNA! Gimenez shoves down Riera and the home side have a spot-kick.
13',action,Juanfran makes a rare mistake on the right flank and it allows Osasuna to send bodies forward to pressure the Atletico defence.
11',action,"Madrid try to pressure the home side on the left, but a loose piece of control of control from Koke allows Flano to clear."
10',yellow-card,Yellow Card Cayetano Bartolomé Bonnín Vásquez ; Tano goes into the book for his poor challenge on Lucas.
10',action,"Tano flies into a challenge to stop Lucas breaking in behind him on the Atletico left flank. The defender would have been through into acres of space there, so not necessarily a poor free-kick to concede."
8',action,"Osasuna relieve the pressure on their backline with a ball over the top for Kenan, although Godin clears the danger Oier tries to follow-up by challenging Tiago in the air, only to give away a cheap free-kick."
7',action,"The visitors are attempting to send their full-backs in behind the Osasuna defence on the flanks, but the home side are repelling their attacks at the moment."

3',action,"CHANCE! Griezmann does well down the left flank to beat his man and then sends a ball across the face of goal for Gameiro to attack. However, the Frenchman misses the target from close range, putting his strike wide of the post. A huge let off for Osasuna."
