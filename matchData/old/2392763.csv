,action,"Claude Puel's decision to leave several of his best players out of the squad was obviously due to Tuesday's game against Swansea City, but it was a choice that backfired with terrible consequences. Arsenal ran riot all over the pitch from start to finish, with the hosts' defence constantly failing to deal with their opponents. Welbeck, Walcott and, later, Sanchez were in all excellent form, and time and time again the Saints were completely clueless as to how to deal with their pace and skill."
,action,FULL-TIME: SOUTHAMPTON 0-5 ARSENAL
90'+2',action,"Southampton patiently work the ball around deep down the right flank as they try to find a late consolation goal, but they're unable to do so quickly enough and the referee eventually brings the game to an end with the final whistle, resulting in a few boos ringing around the half-empty stadium."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be two minutes of added time.
89',action,"Great save by Lewis! A simple ball over the top of the Southampton defence finds Perez all alone in front of goal, but the Spaniard's strike is well smothered by Lewis and fails to result in a sixth goal for Arsenal."
88',action,"Tadic cuts inside from the right wing before whipping a cross into the Arsenal penalty area, but, for the third time since coming off the substitutes' bench, he sends it straight into the hands of Ospina in the middle of the box."
86',action,"Chance for Sims! The youngster, who has arguably been one of Southampton's best players this evening, does well to get a shot away from the edge of the penalty area, but it's well held on to by Ospina at the far post."
84',assist,"Assist Alexis Alejandro Sánchez Sánchez ; Sanchez has been excellent since coming on to the pitch, and once again he excelled in front of goal. The Southampton defence haven't been able to deal with him, as was evident in the build-up to yet another goal for the visitors."
84',goal,"Goal Theo Walcott ; GOAL! Walcott has his hat-trick! A half-hearted Southampton attack comes to an end, and Arsenal immediately hit them on a quick counter. Perez blasts the ball down the pitch and into the path of Sanchez, who holds the ball up well on the edge of the box before teeing up Walcott, who is then easily able to slot a shot past the leg of Lewis."

82',action,"There's a bit of a coming together between Perez and Martina as the Spaniard tries to break down the left flank on a marauding run forward, but he's blocked off by what seems to be the shoulder of the full-back, resulting in an angry exchange between the two."
80',action,"They may be 4-0 up, but Arsenal are still pushing for more goals. Sanchez looks hungry to add one of his own, and the Chilean has been brilliant since coming off the substitutes' bench to help his side."
78',action,"Southampton keep enjoying a good spell of possession as they continue to put Arsenal under some late pressure, but the visitors have enough bodies back to deal with the danger before Martina can get a shot away."
76',action,"Gibbs is caught in possession midway inside the Arsenal half of the pitch, allowing Southampton to push forward once again. Hojbjerg breaks into the penalty area before trying to fire his side back into the game, but, luckily for Gibbs, there are plenty of defenders there to stop the Dane from doing so."
74',action,"Sims breaks down the left flank on a great run before doing well to dart into the Arsenal penalty area, but, not for the first time this evening, Maitland-Niles is there to poke the ball out for a corner. It initially fails to result in a chance on goal before McQueen is able to get a shot away, but it's unable to find its way through the sea of yellow shirts camped in front of him."
72',substitution,; Reine-Adelaide receives a round of applause from the away fans as he's replaced by Alex Iwobi in Arsenal's second change of the night.
71',action,"After another Arsenal attacking move comes to an end, Southampton push forward on a counter-attack of their own. Tadic weaves his way through the middle of the pitch before unleashing a shot from 25 yards out, but it's comfortably closed down and is deflected out for a corner that fails to result in a chance on goal for the home side."
69',assist,"Assist Alexis Alejandro Sánchez Sánchez ; That was a great piece of play from Sanchez, who has looked electric since coming on. However, the Southampton defence were poor once again and really should have done better to track his run."
69',goal,"Goal Theo Walcott ; GOAL! It's 4-0! Bellerin breaks down the right wing on a marauding run before teeing up Sanchez. The Chilean makes a great dart into the Southampton penalty area and picks up the ball near to the byline, and he then spins to find Walcott. The forward is in a pocket of space in the middle of the box and quickly shoots, and his strike is easily able to find the bottom left-hand corner of the net."
68',action,"Almost another mix-up by Mustafi and Ospina! The defender pokes a pass back to the Colombian, who wasn't at all ready for the ball. Redmond darts forward as he tries to latch on to the loose ball, but the goalkeeper is just about able to blast it away before he's able to do so."
67',action,"Southampton enjoy a good spell of possession as they work the ball around nicely midway inside the Arsenal half of the pitch, but Clasie brings a promising attacking move to a disappointing end with a wild strike that flies several yards over the top of the crossbar."

65',substitution,"; And the second is Nathan Redmond, who replaces Long."

63',action,"Perez picks out Gibbs, who then cuts inside from the left flank and tries to pick out Walcott. The full-back's pass is a wayward one, however, with Walcott running one way whilst the ball rolls another."
61',action,"Southampton patiently pass the ball around inside the Arsenal half of the pitch before Hojbjerg darts towards the penalty area. He does well to beat two players before trying to tee up Long, but Gibbs is there to cut out the danger with a great interception."
59',action,"Almost a costly mistake by Mustafi! A lofted pass is flung up towards the Arsenal penalty area and almost finds Sims after a slight mix-up between Mustafi and Ospina, but the German is just about able to blast the ball away before the Southampton teenager can get a shot away."

53',action,"Chance for Bellerin! Welbeck weaves his way through the middle of the pitch on a great run before teeing up Perez.

48',action,"Reine-Adelaide skips past Hojbjerg before being caught by an outstretched leg from the Dane, resulting in a free-kick for Arsenal. It's sent short and worked forward quickly, but Southampton have plenty of bodies back to deal with the danger."

,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"So far, so good for Arsenal, who head into the half-time break with a comfortable three-goal lead that, based on that first-half performance, should easily see them into the next round of the competition. Southampton have been all over the place at the back, with their inexperienced defence failing to deal with Perez, Walcott and, in particular, Welbeck. The latter has been excellent thus far, with his two goals leaving young Lewis with no chance whatsoever."
,action,HALF-TIME: SOUTHAMPTON 0-3 ARSENAL

37',action,"Southampton push forward straight from the restart as they desperately try to find a way back into the game.

35',assist,"Assist Daniel Nii Tackie Mensah Welbeck ; Once again, Welbeck was able to skip into the penalty area far too easily. Southampton have really struggled to deal with his runs, and it was both McQueen and Stephens who were most at fault for the visitors' latest goal."

30',action,"Mustafi almost makes it 3-0! The throw-in is sent short to Perez, who is then clumsily fouled by McQueen. The resulting free-kick is whipped into the heart of the box and finds Mustafi all alone in front of goal, but he's unable to make decent contact with the ball and sends his close-range header wide of the goal. He really should have buried that!"

Oxlade-Chamberlain receives possession on the halfway line and immediately fires a brilliant lofted pass over the top of the Southampton defence and into the path of Welbeck. The striker skips past Stephens far too easily before bringing the ball down with a wonderful touch, and he then slots a lovely shot through the legs of Lewis."
21',action,"Florin Gardos, who has looked rusty on his return to the starting line-up, commits a third mistake of the game and gifts Walcott with a chance to break towards the penalty area, but he's just about able to dart back and make amends for his error with a well-timed sliding interception."

Ashley Maitland-Niles breaks forward before picking out Perez with a deft pass up to the edge of the Southampton penalty area.

10',action,"Vital block by Shkhodran Mustafi! Cuco Martina flies down the right wing on an excellent run before swinging a cross into the heart of the Arsenal penalty area and towards Shane Long, but just as it looks as if the striker is going to make contact with the ball, Mustafi dives in the way to stop him from doing so."

,action,"Arsenal are unbeaten in their previous six games, with all of their previous three ending in victories, but they were made to work extremely hard by Burnley on Sunday and only just managed to leave with all three points thanks to a 98th-minute Alexis Sanchez penalty. They also struggled for large sections of the game against Preston North End in the third round, with their second-tier opposition finally being beaten by a last-minute Olivier Giroud winner."
,action,"Southampton will be certainly hoping that this afternoon’s clash isn’t as close and hard-fought as both of the games they had to endure against Norwich City in the last round. After being held to a 2-2 draw in the first meeting between the two sides, the Saints narrowly beat their Championship opponents thanks to a last-minute goal scored by Shane Long, who went on to fire in another late winner against Liverpool on Wednesday."
,action,"After suffering a disappointing new year period, Southampton head into today’s big cup tie full of confidence thanks to their third consecutive victory. Another impressive performance against Liverpool saw the Hampshire side win 1-0 to book their place in the final of the EFL Cup, and they’ll be looking to repeat that feat with a similar performance today."
