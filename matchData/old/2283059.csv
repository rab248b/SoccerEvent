,action,"That's all for today, thanks for joining us. Goodbye!"
,action,And that's it! Atleti cling on to Saul's stunning goal and claim a much-needed win against a determined and unfortunate Las Palmas.
90'+5',action,FULL-TIME: Atletico Madrid 1-0 Las Palmas.
90'+4',action,The visiting players are slightly bemused as Gaitan gets away with a fairly blatant foul and then wins a free-kick himself. Time is running out for Las Palmas...
90'+3',action,"Atleti just about clear a Las Palmas free-kick, but Michel delivers again. This time, Moya takes control, handling supremely."
90'+2',action,"SAVE! Partey immediately pounces on a loose ball to shoot at goal, but it's easy for Javi Varas."
90'+1',action,There are four minutes to be added here... Can Atleti hold on?
90',substitution,; Thomas Partey is on in place of Antoine Griezmann.
88',action,"SAVE! Excellent play from Las Palmas! They take their time, pick their passes and finally shoot through Momo inside the area. Moya, though, responds well with a firm parry."
86',substitution,; El Zhar makes way. On comes Momo.
85',action,"Gaitan has an opportunity to slip Torres in on the left, but his pass is far too powerful and runs behind."
84',substitution,"; Another switch, this one for the hosts, sees Gameiro replaced by Nicolas Gaitan."
84',substitution,; Dani Castellano steps in for Helder Lopes.
83',substitution,; Vicente Gomez makes way for Tana.
82',action,SAVE! Javi Varas just about escapes with the ball as he and Torres compete for a right-wing cross. That almost dropped for the Atleti favourite.
80',action,"Atleti haven't really been good enough on the break today. Too many wrong decisions in great positions, and the latest sees Montoro steal possession."
79',action,"Yet another dangerous Atleti corner, but Javi Varas does brilliantly to dash from his line and claim the ball."
77',substitution,"; It's not really been Carrasco's day, and he's replaced by Fernando Torres."
75',action,"The pattern of play is slightly more frantic now, which probably favours the hosts. Gabi charges into Jonathan Viera and appears to be in the clear, but the referee calls play back for a foul."
73',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Yannick Ferreira Carrasco ; Carrasco leads with his arm as he challenges for a high ball, and is duly booked."
72',action,"Every time Las Palmas lose the ball now, they're so quick to win it back. They weren't doing this earlier, hence the number of dangerous Atleti counters. Still, though, the visitors cannot force their way through."
70',action,"Helder Lopes wants a free-kick as he attacks again on the left, but the decision goes against him and he's fortunate not to be penalised for handling amid his appeal."
68',action,"CHANCE! Another Atleti corner, and Diego Godin is up to head at goal. The ball loops just wide, though, with his team-mates unable to help it on target. Javi Varas receives treatment after seemingly colliding with his post."
66',action,"Carrasco gets this all wrong! Roque Mesa, on a booking, tries to halt the Belgian but cannot. Carrasco continues and has Gameiro in acres of space on the right, with the visitors caught upfield. However, the Atleti winger chooses to go alone and is swiftly crowded out."
64',action,"CHANCE! And what a chance! Helder Lopes has been terrific on the left, and centres again. The ball reaches Michel at the back post, but he blazes over with time to do so much better."
63',action,Livaja chases a little too hard as the visitors seek an opportunity to restore parity. He fouls Stefan Savic.
61',action,"BLOCK! Roque Mesa is involved in everything at the moment, as is Saul. The latter blocks from the former. Las Palmas aren't finished yet..."
59',goal,"Goal Saúl Ñíguez Esclapez ; GOAL! Spectacular from Saul! Atleti have not been at it, but the midfielder's thumping drive - his first league goal of the season - rips past Javi Varas from 25 yards. 1-0."
58',action,"SAVE! A real chance now for Las Palmas! Roque Mesa dashes through on the left, shooting low at the near post, but Moya saves well. Promising for the visitors."
57',action,"Almost a chance for Atleti! Lemos slips, allowing Gameiro to run onto the ball. However, quick as a flash, Bigas is there to close down."
56',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Roque Mesa Quevedo ; Roque Mesa goes into the book, clipping the heels of an accelerating Atleti player after another turnover."
54',action,"Wild from Koke! Gameiro's pace again causes problems, winning a corner, but Gabi's set-piece is pulled back for Koke to lash up and up and up. That ball's still rising."
53',action,"Finally, after a lengthy stoppage, Jonathan Viera delivers. But it's low and tame, and Atleti clear."
51',action,"With Vrsaljko lunging into a challenge on Helder Lopes, Las Palmas have a free-kick in a dangerous position not far from the penalty area on the left..."
49',action,"SAVE! This is easy for Moya, but Las Palmas are getting opportunities. El Zhar's cross is blocked, earning a corner, and the same man ultimately shoots from the right of the area, straight into the goalkeeper's hands."
47',action,"Las Palmas are again passing the ball nicely, but they have to as every error leads to an Atleti attack. Gameiro twice beats his man on the right before crossing, but Michel confidently clears."
46',action,KICK-OFF: Away we go again!
,action,Here come the players as we near the beginning of the second 45!
,action,"After a slow start in which Atleti could have scored more than once, Las Palmas have enjoyed the better of the game. Both sides hit the woodwork in the first half, and the home supporters do not sound happy as we head into the break..."
45',action,HALF-TIME: Atletico Madrid 0-0 Las Palmas.
43',yellow-card,Yellow Card Saúl Ñíguez Esclapez ; Saul goes into the book as he hauls down the accelerating Roque Mesa.
42',action,"BLOCK! More like it from Griezmann. He races away on the right, squaring up the defender and drilling a shot at goal. His effort is blocked, though, and Lemos dives in front of the follow-up."
42',action,"Las Palmas appear to have a shooting opportunity on the edge of the box, but, despite a yellow shirt laying on the floor, the referee calls it Atleti's way."
41',action,"It's Las Palmas' turn to press. They finally force an error from Moya, with a rushed clearance, and take the ball back. El Zhar is fouled."
39',action,"CHANCE! It should be 1-0! Simeone applauds again, but Gameiro has to do better as he pokes past the near post from in front of goal. That move began as Jonathan Viera slipped in the Atleti half, again showing how frail the visitors' standing in this game could be."
37',action,"Crucial clearance from Bigas. Another high ball into the Las Palmas area, and the defender charges in to nod clear in front of Gameiro."
35',action,"Atleti respond. A long throw causes mayhem in the area, but Helder Lopes' awkward header is plucked from the air by Javi Varas."
34',action,"In fact, Las Palmas are on top now. El Zhar tries to twist his body onto a left-wing cross, but can only help the ball wide."
33',action,"CROSSBAR! Incredible! While Atleti remain a threat on the break, Las Palmas are growing into this one. After more neat passing, Mauricio Lemos launches a thundering strike from 35 yards that rattles the top of the crossbar."
31',action,"BLOCK! Helder Lopes is having some joy on the left. He crosses, Atleti struggle, and Livaja tees up Jonathan Viera. The low shot is charged down quickly, however."
29',action,"CHANCE! Magnificent defending! Griezmann cannot understand how he hasn't earned a corner, but on second viewing it seemed as though the referee was spot on. As the Atleti man lined up his shot in on the right, Pedro Bigas recovers to put pressure on the French star. In the end, he prods wide, with Bigas diving in."
28',action,"A corner for the visitors, at last. It comes after a flowing move, with each pass cheered by their supporters, but Atleti smash the ball clear as Las Palmas try to be a little too clever. Gameiro is off and running again."
26',action,"Las Palmas certainly like to get the ball down and pass it. Their play looks wonderful when it comes off, but a little too often they are conceding possession and set-pieces."
25',action,"Yet another corner! Gameiro is bullied out of possession by the corner flag, but earns a set-piece. Koke, again, delivers, but the flicked near-post header is a long way over."
22',action,"Lovely stuff from the visitors! They belatedly enjoy a first attack, and Helder Lopes crosses from the left. It's knocked away, but Las Palmas build again. Some intricate passing and clever movement almost allows Marko Livaja in, but the ball escapes his attentions."
21',action,"More sloppy Las Palmas defending, another Atleti corner. Again, though, it's easily cleared. Atleti need to turn their domination into a goal."
19',action,"After showing no interest in appealing for that blatant foul, Gameiro optimistically shouts for a penalty as he smashes a cross into a defender's stomach. Handball? No chance."
18',action,"CHANCE! Las Palmas are caught on the counter as they look to respond, and Gameiro races clear from his own half. A recovering defender tries to bring the Frenchman down, but he stays on his feet. Gameiro then has the option to shoot or pick out Griezmann, opts for the latter and fails to find his team-mate. He should really have done better."
16',action,"POST! Simeone is applauding his players as Saul Niguez dives into an acrobatic volley and strikes the woodwork from a bouncing ball in the area. Griezmann pounces on the rebound, but, from a tight angle, drills across the face of goal."
14',action,"Griezmann makes room to shoot, but loses the ball. He's quick to dive back into a challenge in the area, but the referee deems it a foul."
13',action,"Atleti are putting together a string of corners. Vrsaljko wins another, but it's cleared again."
12',action,"Another effort from Atleti, but this one is similarly wayward. Koke whips in an excellent corner, and, when it is nodded clear, it finally falls for Carrasco to shoot on the edge of the area. It was a rather optimistic attempt, though, and flies into the stands."
10',action,"CHANCE! A first sight of goal for Atleti. Koke's lovely pass picks out Gameiro in behind the defence, but he cannot get the ball out from under his feet and prods tamely and harmlessly wide."
9',action,"Vrsaljko receives the ball near the byline, hammering a cross into the nearest defender to win a corner. The delivery is rashly sliced by a Las Palmas man on the near post, but they escape at the second attempt."
8',action,"Las Palmas finally enjoy some time in possession, but, after building a move into the opposition half, a launched clearance sets Gameiro after the ball again. He's beaten to it, but the visitors have to start again."
7',action,"There's a stoppage as Roque Mesa goes down, but it quickly becomes clear he is just changing his footwear. After plenty of whistles from the crowd, we're away again."
6',action,"Carrasco is given space to work with on the left, and he tears forward to deliver a teasing cross. Fine defending at the back post keeps the hosts out, though. Gameiro's looked lively so far."
4',action,"It's all Atleti at this early stage. They're pressing high, with goalkeeper Javi Varas quickly under pressure, but Antoine Griezmann cannot get onto a deflected through ball as the hosts seize possession."
2',action,"A long throw is propelled into the Las Palmas box, but the visitors just about deal with it and a foul allows them time to recover."
1',action,"Atleti make a bright start, and Kevin Gameiro almost wrestles his way through for an early chance. He's closed out, but there are soon cheers from the fans here as the referee takes a tumble. Lovely stuff."
1',action,KICK-OFF: And we're off! Las Palmas get us started...
,action,The players are on the pitch. The game will soon get under way!
,action,"Las Palmas, meanwhile, have drawn their last three matches. The most recent stalemate came against Leganes, and they make three changes, bringing in Mauricio Lemos, Nabil El Zhar and Montoro."
,action,"Atleti head into this game having lost back-to-back games in all competitions. Their 1-0 reverse at Bayern Munich may have been a Champions League dead rubber, but a 3-0 humbling at Villarreal was rather more worrying. There are four new faces for this one: Moya, Sime Vrsaljko, Saul Niguez and Yannick Carrasco."
,action,"Subs: Lizoain, Simon, Castellano, Tana, Asdrubal, Hernan, Momo."
,action,"Las Palmas: Javi Varas, Michel Macedo, Lemos, Bigas, Helder Lopes, El Zhar, Roque Mesa, Montoro, Vicente Gomez, Jonathan Viera, Livaja."
,action,"Subs: Moreira, Juanfran, Gimenez, Partey, Moreno, Gaitan, Torres."
,action,"Atletico Madrid: Moya, Vrsaljko, Savic, Godin, Hernandez, Niguez, Gabi, Koke, Carrasco, Griezmann, Gameiro."
,action,"After an indifferent start to the season, Atleti will be hoping for a win today to climb closer to the top four. The visitors, however, can move within a point of Diego Simeone's men with victory."
