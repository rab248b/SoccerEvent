,action,"FULL-TIME! Barcelona close out a comfortable 3-0 win over Osasuna, with the hosts poor form at El Sadar continuing.

That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+2',goal,"Goal Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini ; GOOOOOOOOOOAL! MESSI MAKES IT 3-0! The Argentina international is found on the edge of the penalty area, and some incredibly lax defending allows the Barcelona man to fire a finish across goal and into the bottom-right corner."

88',action,"Barcelona just keep patiently probing for a gap, with Busquets happy to sit back and act as the fulcrum. Denis combines with Alba down the left, before Iniesta drives forward, but the away side aren't interested in losing possession. Now it's about winding down the dying seconds."
86',action,"Barcelona continue to see the lion's share of the ball, but Caparros can be pleased with Osasuna's late resurgence. Ter Stegen has been asked a couple of questions, with Enrique's men happy to slow things down as a result. Alba cuts a cross into the box in search of Messi, but Nauzet collects ahead of the Argentine."
84',yellow-card,Yellow Card Roberto Torres Morales ; Torres picks up a late booking for Osasuna.
84',action,"There is another stoppage in play, as this time Clerc goes down with an injury problem for the home side. He looked to go over awkwardly on his ankle, after a collision with Rafinha, and that doesn't look good on first viewing. Fortunately, however, he appears able to carry on, despite moving gingerly."
82',action,"Good save from Ter Stegen! Berenguer races down the left-hand side and clips a cross-cum-shot into the box, forcing the German shot-stopper to palm a save over the crossbar. He gets a pat on the back from Alba for his efforts."
80',action,"The home side try to threaten down the right-hand side, but a poor cross is easily cut out inside the Barcelona penalty area. Suarez is nearly picked out on the counter as the visitors immediately respond, but Nauzet is quick off his line to hammer clear."
79',action,"Sergio Leon cuts back onto his left foot from the right-hand side, but can only drill a low shot straight down Ter Stegen's throat. Barcelona respond by retaining possession and trying to take the sting out of the potential for a late resurgence from Osasuna."
77',substitution,"; Andre Gomes takes his leave, with Rafinha given the chance to impress in the last 10 minutes or so."
76',action,"Play is stoppage briefly, as Sergi Roberto treads on the foot of Sergio Leon, and that looks like a sore one for the Osasuna striker. Only 15 minutes remain for the hosts to see out, and the Spaniard looks to be fine to continue."
74',action,"Osasuna are really facing an uphill battle now, as the hosts need to find two goals from somewhere to have any chance to taking a share of the spoils. Given that Sergio Leon's long-range chip is the only opportunity that they've had in this second half, the come-back isn't looking likely."
72',assist,"Assist Jordi Alba Ramos ; Alba is found at the left byline once again, and picks out a lovely cut-back once again. Two assists for the Spaniard today."
72',goal,"Goal Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini ; GOOOOOOOOOAL! MESSI MAKES IT 2-0! The Argentina international is able to clip a lovely finish home from the near post, after some good work down the left-hand side once again. Nauzet has no chance this time."
70',substitution,"; Riera is taken off, after a very anonymous game, with Kodro introduced late on."
70',action,"With 20 minutes left on the clock, Barcelona are still not entirely in the clear. Sergio Leon is looking dangerous on the counter, and one mistake from the visitors might prove costly. Pique finds Sergi Roberto out on the right, but the Spaniard is forced backwards by Clerc. Good defending."
68',action,"Messi manages to dig out a shot from the edge of the penalty area, after turning onto his left foot well, but Nauzet pushes the ball around the post for a corner. The set-piece is taken short and worked into Denis, but De Las Cuevas comes out quickly to tackle the ex-Sevilla midfielder."
66',action,"Messi tries to lift a pass out to the left-hand side, which threatens to find Alba getting in behind the Osasuna back four once again, but Nauzet is quickly out to gather up the loose ball. The hosts' goalkeeper has been key this afternoon."
65',substitution,"; Arda takes his leave after a fairly quiet showing, with Denis getting a chance out wide on the left-hand side."
63',substitution,"; Bonnin is introduced for Oier, probably due to the latter picking up an early yellow card."
63',action,"Andre Gomes leads a break for the away side, playing a couple of neat one-twos to get Barcelona upfield. The quality of the pitch isn't helping the visitors, with Messi eventually unable to get the ball out from under his feet. Arda tries an over-head kick from inside the penalty area, but is penalised for a high boot."
61',action,"Sergio Leon is picked out inside the penalty area by Berenguer, and goes down after a push from Umtiti, but play had already been halted for offside. The Osasuna striker didn't hear the whistle! The ex-Elche man is still looking to cause problems."

59',goal,"Goal Luis Alberto Suárez Díaz ; GOOOOOOOOAL! SUAREZ MAKES IT 1-0! Messi manages to find Alba in space at the left byline, with Alba able to square a pass straight to the Uruguay international. He slots home the easiest finish of his career."

54',action,"Barcelona continue to pile on the pressure, with the hosts' back four only getting any respite when Sergio Leon goes on bursting runs forward. Iniesta tries to bend a cross in from the left, but Ivan Marquez nods clear, before Clerc puts a good foot in to deny Messi inside the box."
52',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Iván Márquez Álvarez ; Ivan Marquez gets a yellow card for tugging on Messi's shirt, as the Argentina international spun his marker and tried to get in behind."
50',action,"The away side are dominating possession, but Osasuna are showing that they can do some damage on the counter! Iniesta is the man trying to make things happen in the middle of the park, but the hosts are congesting the midfield third and defending well. The home fans whistle an extended period of pressure for the Blaugrana."
48',action,"OFF THE BAR! What a hit from Sergio Leon! The ex-Elche striker races down the right channel and spots Ter Stegen off his line. He clips a shot goalwards from long-range, from a wide position, and the ball cannons off the frame of the goal and behind for a goal-kick. So close!"
46',substitution,"; Miguel Flano is replaced after picking up a knock in the first half, with David Garcia injected into the game. He will need to get into the swing of things quickly."

,action,"HALF-TIME! Osasuna make their way into the interval with the scoreline at 0-0, and both sides have missed some good chances.

44',action,"Arda cuts back a cross from the left-hand side, but Messi can only stroke a shot wide of the far post.

42',action,"Suarez finds Messi, who looks to stab a low finish into the bottom-left corner, but the ball evades before Suarez and the back post. Osasuna respond with an attack down the right, but a cross from Riera is denied by a block from Busquets."

39',action,"Messi clips a pass out to Alba on the left-hand side, but De Las Cuevas tracks back to make a good tackle. Narrowly over five minutes remain in the first half, with Osasuna very close to keeping Barcelona at bay. To get to the interval unscathed would be a big achievement."
37',action,"Good effort from Iniesta! The Spain international takes aim from long range with a shot that threatens to sail into the top-left corner. Nauzet is worried, but the ball dips just shy of the target. That wasn't far away at all!"
35',action,"The away side can't quite find the final ball required to pierce this Osasuna defence, with the hosts playing quite deep to guard against passes in behind. Flano goes down with an injury problem, after challenging Messi, and it doesn't look good for the centre-back at the moment. He may have a dead leg."
33',action,"Barcelona have had all of the possession and the lion's share of the chances, but that opportunity for Riera shows how precarious their position is. The away side threaten down the right, but are forced back infield, before a flicked pass from Arda finds Nauzet rather than Suarez."
31',action,"WHAT A CHANCE! Oriol Riera is picked out at the back post, and slides in to try and open the scoring. The Spaniard pulls off Umtiti and tries to meet a low cross from De Las Cuevas, but Riera can't stretch every sinew of his body enough to apply a finish from a few yards out."
29',action,"Arda clips a wonderful pass in behind for Suarez to chase, before the latter releases Alba down the left. The Spaniard finds Messi in the box, before a pass is set aside for Arda once again, but the Turkey international pulls out of taking on a close-range effort."
27',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Oier Sanjurjo Mate ; Oier gets a yellow card, which will see him miss the next Osasuna game in the league, after the right-back dives in late on Alba. He actually manages to tear a hole in his opponent's sock!"
26',action,"Messi finds Suarez out on the right-hand side, who quickly returns a pass into the Argentina international. He gets into the area and tries to lift a deft chip over the goalkeeper, but Nauzet gets a good hand to the ball to turn it over the crossbar. Another chance goes begging for the visitors!"
24',action,"Messi threads a brilliant throughball out to Alba on the left-hand side, but the ex-Valencia left-back slips while crossing. It forces a rushed clearance, which earns a corner for the away side. Suarez is picked out at the back post, but sees a shot deflected wide, before Iniesta curls a 20-yard effort high and wide of the top-right corner."
22',action,"Iniesta tries to slide Suarez in behind, but this time the former Liverpool striker is caught straying offside. Despite all of their early dominance, Barcelona just can't quite seem to find their way through in this first half. Miguel Flano is penalised for catching the Uruguayan's knee."
21',action,"Arda bounds into space in midfield, before slotting a pass into Suarez. The Uruguay international tries to lift a throughball into the box for Messi, but Marquez is there to head clear.

15',action,"Umtiti is picked out by a clipped free-kick delivery from Iniesta, but the French centre-back can only guide a close-range header well over the crossbar! Moments later, Messi is found in space inside the box by Suarez, but the Argentine forward shoots straight at Nauzet, who made himself very big. Huge chances missed by the visitors so far."
13',action,"OFF THE POST! Alba races down the left and cuts back a neat cross towards Suarez. The Uruguayan striker holds it up and spins Marquez, but can only plant a shot onto the foot of the right-hand upright. Gomes and Messi try to combine with the rebounding ball, but the Portuguese midfielder can only find Nauzet with a return pass."
12',action,"De Las Cuevas tries to bend a cross in from the right, but play is pulled back for a Pique tackle on Berenguer. The Spain international pushes his man to the ground. Torres bends the set-piece in from deep, but it sails straight into the awaiting arms of Ter Stegen."
10',action,"Alba is found making a run on the overlap, but Oier shepherds the ball out of play after getting the right side of his man. Osasuna are very much on the back foot, with the hosts forced to give possession away quite quickly with long, direct passes upfield. Barcelona have started well, with Luis Enrique looking very animated on the touchline."

The Barca star flicks a beautiful ball over the top for Suarez to chase, but the ex-Ajax striker can only race into the box and drag a finish wide of the back post under pressure from the goalkeeper."
6',action,"Oriol Riera is dropping very deep for the home side, who are basically playing in a 4-5-1 when Barcelona enjoy long spells of possession. Sergio Leon is left up top, with their pacy top goalscorer looking to prey on scraps. Suarez is found by a low pass into feet, but the Uruguay international takes a poor first touch that allows Nauzet to gather."
4',action,"Berenguer nods a tame header straight at Ter Stegen, after Osasuna won the first corner of the game. The same man races down the left after pickpocketing Messi on the half-way line, but Sergi Roberto recovers to make a good tackle. The hosts are remaining in two organised banks of four."
2',action,"Alba and Arda Turan are found overlapping down the left-hand side, but a pass out to them to far too heavy. Osasuna respond with a break, as Sergio Leon uses his pace to get in behind, but Pique covers across to make a fantastic sliding challenge. A bright start!"
