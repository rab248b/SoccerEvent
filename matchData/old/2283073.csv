,action,That's all from the Bernabeu after one of the easiest fixtures Madrid will play all season. Thanks for joining us. Goodbye!
,action,"Madrid took their foot off the gas after the break, but it mattered little with the hard work done in the opening 45. Isco nabbed two, while the other goals were shared between Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo and Casemiro. They are now 39 unbeaten!"
90',action,FULL-TIME: Real Madrid 5-0 Granada.
90',action,"SAVE! Kravets is still chasing and he finally works Navas! It's a fairly routine save in the end, though, with the angle closing on the Granada front man."
89',action,"Granada are tiring now. Benzema finds Cristiano Ronaldo to break again. Rodriguez picks up the ball on the right, but his centre cannot find the offside Benzema."
88',action,"More work for Ochoa, but this is easy as he claims Rodriguez's corner after the previous set-piece had been nudged behind from Benzema's header."
87',action,"SAVE! Casemiro steals possession and prompts Modric to lead a counter. Rodriguez took up the ball on the right, played in Cristiano Ronaldo to shimmy into space and shoot. Ochoa gets in the way of the powerful blast."
85',action,"A slightly nervy moment for Navas. He comes out to control a long ball, but Kravets quickly closes him down. Running out of space, the goalkeeper hacks into touch under pressure."
83',action,"Benzema's link-up play has been sublime today. He creates crossing opportunities for both Cristiano Ronaldo and Rodriguez, but neither can find a teammate."
82',action,"SAVE! Rodriguez is found by Benzema on the left of the area, but he can only squeeze a shot straight at Ochoa."
80',action,"Navas dirties his shorts for the first time, diving out to punch away Pereira's cross. Fairly simple stuff again for the Madrid man."
79',action,"The game has become somewhat scrappier in recent minutes, with Madrid perhaps happy with their margin of victory and niggly fouls sneaking in."
77',substitution,"; Tabanou is jeered from the field after his earlier challenge on Carvajal, and Ezequiel Ponce is the man to come on."
76',action,"Offsides at both ends as Kravets and Ronaldo both fail to find the target from advanced positions. Despite the scoreline, both men have endured frustrating games."
73',action,"Rodriguez delivers the free-kick again, and picks out Cristiano Ronaldo. Leaping in the centre of goal, he somehow fails to direct the ball towards the target."
72',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Franck Tabanou ; Tabanou is a lucky, lucky boy! He flies into Carvajal, late and high, but takes only a yellow card."
71',yellow-card,Yellow Card Carlos Henrique Casimiro ; Casemiro crashes into Javi Marquez and earns a yellow card.
71',action,Rodriguez pips Cristiano Ronaldo to the resultant free-kick and curls a fine effort just inches away from the top corner.
70',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Gabriel Moisés Antunes da Silva ; Gabriel Silva protests his innocence, but he's booked for a clear handball."
69',action,Cristiano Ronaldo is now wearing the captain's armband in Marcelo's absence.
68',substitution,"; Marcelo has been superb today, but he's now rested as Fabio Coentrao comes on to a rather unconvincing reception."
68',action,"Unsurprisingly, the set-piece comes to nothing and Navas can take the goal-kick."
67',action,A chance for Granada? Kravets battles away and wins a free-kick from Nacho in a promising position...
65',substitution,"; Jeremie Boga has been particularly quiet in this second half, and Alberto Bueno replaces him."
65',action,"OFFSIDE! Benzema crosses from the right for Marcelo to hammer a strike back into the box. Benzema arrives at the far post, with Ochoa scrambling, but the Madrid forward is offside."
63',action,"Cristiano Ronaldo's not happy up the other end. He sprints onto a long ball and looks to pull the trigger, before going down as the ball ran wide. No foul."
62',action,"CHANCE! Granada finally have a sniff of goal. Tabanou arrives from the left to meet a cross, but does not get enough on the header, flicking wide."
60',substitution,"; Uche, booked for a foul on Casemiro and then losing the same man at a set-piece, makes way for Javi Marquez."
58',assist,"Assist James David Rodríguez Rubio ; With Tabanou fouling Asensio, Rodriguez delivered a wonderful free-kick for Casemiro to net."
58',goal,"Goal Carlos Henrique Casimiro ; GOAL! Casemiro gets in on the act! Somehow arriving completely unmarked at the back post, he smuggles the ball over the line. 5-0."
57',yellow-card,Yellow Card Uche Henry Agbo ; Uche goes into the book as he shrugs off the challenge of Casemiro illegally.
56',action,"Nacho is caught upfield, having wandered forwards in open play, and Kravets accelerates. Casemiro, though, is there to make a perfectly timed challenge."
55',action,"Despite his goal, it's not quite come off for Cristiano Ronaldo today. Another run is halted as he looks to get a shot away on the edge of the area."
54',action,"Cristiano Ronaldo just gets this wrong! Benzema's backheel is dummied by Modric for the Portugal international, but he cannot return a pass into the path of his onrushing teammate."
53',action,"CHANCE! Rodriguez delivers from the left, and Nacho appeals for a penalty as he challenges. The ball drops for Benzema, but he blazes over on his left."
52',action,"Rodriguez works the ball inside to Cristiano Ronaldo, who turns to find Benzema and then Carvajal. With Marcelo in the box, the cross is turned behind and the corner is then cleared."
51',substitution,"; Asensio, brilliant against Sevilla, is on for the struggling Isco. A shame for the two-goal man."
50',action,"CHANCE! And there was the opportunity for his hat-trick! Running onto Carvajal's cross, he nods wide of the post with his final touch."
48',action,"Isco looks as though he's hobbling slightly, and Marco Asensio is readying himself on the sidelines. A blow for the man who's on a hat-trick."
46',action,SAVE! This is Ochoa's best save yet! Carvajal pulls back a square ball for Benzema to control and drive an effort towards the corner. Ochoa parries well.
46',action,KICK-OFF: Real Madrid 4-0 Granada. We're off again!
46',substitution,"; Kroos has been quiet, and, a booking away from suspension, is replaced by James Rodriguez."
,action,The Madrid players are emerging onto the pitch again. Victory is surely secured; can they add to that already mammoth scoreline?
,action,"This has been embarrassingly easy for Madrid. Isco has two, Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo grabbed the others. Marcelo has been the star, but, in truth, Granada haven't been able to get within touching distance of a single white shirt."
45',action,HALF-TIME: Real Madrid 4-0 Granada.
45',action,"SAVE! You guessed it, Ochoa holds on. Cristiano Ronaldo's shot from distance was somewhat tamer than Madrid's previous efforts."
44',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Sergi Samper Montaña ; Perhaps frustrated by his own poor performance, or the general pattern of play, Samper kicks out wildly at the advancing Isco and takes a booking."
43',action,"SAVE! Another stop from Ochoa. Modric with a gorgeous one-two on the edge of the box, receiving the ball back from Benzema, he pokes at the keeper."
42',action,"Navas gathers the ball with his hands for the first time. A low cross threatens to reach the advancing Kravets, but it's easy for the goalkeeper."
41',action,"Ronaldo wins a free-kick on the left as he's wrestled from the ball, but Kroos' delivery is horribly short. Granada escape this time."
39',action,"Granada initially press Madrid as they pass it around the back, harrying Navas in possession, before perhaps recalling their earlier punishment on the counter. The visitors restreat into shape."
37',action,"SAVE AGAIN! He's let in four, but Ochoa has made his fair share of stops already. Toni Kroos cannot slide a shot beyond the Granada keeper."
37',action,"SAVE! Isco fancies his hat-trick! He takes the ball from Benzema, dips inside onto his right, and Ochoa does well to turn his strike around the post."
36',action,"Kravets is still chasing away up front for the visitors, but a long ball is dealt with by Nacho as he looked to get in behind."
34',action,It's surely safe to assume that Madrid have tied Barca's record unbeaten run now. The home fans are enjoying themselves in the sunshine.
32',action,"Isco and Cristiano Ronaldo immediately come close to combining for the chance of a fifth. This will be a long, long remaining hour for Granada."
31',assist,"Assist Luka Modrić ; It was Modric's turn to tee one up, dashing up the right and drilling across to find Isco."
31',goal,Goal Francisco Román Alarcón Suárez ; GOAL! This is oh so easy for Isco! He steals in at the back post to scramble a finish into the net. 4-0.
31',action,SAVE AGAIN! Ochoa does well to cling to another strike. Benzema held the ball up for Carvajal to batter into the Mexico international's arms from the edge of the area.
30',action,SAVE! Marcelo is enjoying himself today. He easily skips into space and then hammers at goal from a tight angle. Ochoa holds on.
27',assist,"Assist Marcelo Vieira da Silva Júnior ; It was Marcelo who laid on that goal for Cristiano Ronaldo, with some lovely footwork on the left and a measured cross."
27',goal,"Goal Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro ; GOAL! Now Madrid have got on the end of a cross, and it's Cristiano Ronaldo! He darts in front of Tabanou to crash a header into the roof of the net. 3-0."
26',action,"Madrid enjoy some territorial dominance once more. Benzema forces a corner and numerous crosses follow. Neither Nacho nor Varane can get on the end of one, though."
24',action,"It's easy to see how Granada were so easily caught out for the second. Having thrown bodies forward, Madrid coolly clear up again and counter. This time, there's no goal."
21',action,"That positive spell for Granada didn't last long, did it? This could end up any score-line..."
20',goal,"Goal Karim Benzema ; GOAL! Benzema makes it two! Modric's low drive is saved by Ochoa, but he can only parry and, with no defenders following in, the Madrid forward is left alone to prod into the net. 2-0."
20',action,"And a first shot from the visitors. Andreas Pereira cuts in from the left, but blazes high, so high, and that causes Keylor Navas no problems."
19',action,"Now a Granada attack. With men forward, the ball arrives at Franck Tabanou's feet on the left. His cross is hard and low, but easily dealt with by Varane."
18',action,"Artem Kravets has his work cut out today for Granada. He's made a couple of good runs in behind, but, with Raphael Varane, Casemiro and Nacho shielding, the ball has not come his way. It could be a long 90 minutes for the visiting forward..."
16',action,"Cristiano Ronaldo hammers in a strike from distance, which is deflected away for a corner. With the big men forward from the back, though, Isco takes the set-piece short and then runs the ball out of play. Poor."
15',action,"Was that a shot? Benzema picks the ball up on the left, and, with nothing on, lashes a strike clear of the crossbar. Speculative at best."
12',assist,"Assist Karim Benzema ; It was Karim Benzema who slipped Isco in, after Sergi Samper had cheaply given up possession in the midfield."
12',goal,"Goal Francisco Román Alarcón Suárez ; GOAL! Madrid are ahead, and Isco has the goal! The Spain international struck hard and low, the ball squirming under Guillermo Ochoa and into the corner. 1-0."
12',action,"The crosses are raining in on the Granada box! Isco delivers this time, a glorious whipped effort, and Lomban is required to nod clear."
10',action,"Carvajal and Marcelo are involved again. The latter crosses for Cristiano Ronaldo, who can only nod back for Carvajal to screw across the box. The ball finally arrives for Marcelo to shoot, but he blazes over."
8',action,"After a surprisingly slack Luka Modric pass, Granada are finally on the ball, keeping possession and moving into the Madrid half. They certainly won't be able to hold out for 90 minutes without coming forward themselves."
6',action,"Carvajal is again involved as Madrid come forward. He and Marcelo were crucial to their midweek win, and the two combine as the right-back steams onto his captain's cross. Carvajal's control is poor, but he turns to deliver again, just beyond Cristiano Ronaldo."
5',action,"Cristiano Ronaldo, as always, is drifting into the middle, but he's been scarcely involved in the early stages. An appeal for a free-kick on the edge of the Granada area was turned away."
3',action,"Predictably, Madrid are dominating the ball so far. Other than that Carvajal dash, they've not yet threatened to get in on goal, though."
1',action,"An early positive dart from Dani Carvajal onto a diagonal ball down the right, but the ball just slipped away under his foot."
1',action,KICK-OFF: Granada get us under way!
,action,"Now, finally, we're ready to get started..."
,action,"As the players wait for the off, there's currently a presentation on the pitch for Cristiano Ronaldo after his latest Ballon d'Or win. Former winners and Madrid stars Michael Owen, Luis Figo, Ronaldo and, of course, Zinedine Zidane are in attendance. There are also video messages from Kaka and Fabio Cannavaro."
,action,The players are on the pitch. We are just moments from kick-off!
,action,"In theory, Madrid - the league-leaders - should have little difficulty in this one. Granada are winless away from home this term, lie second from bottom, and have tasted victory just once in the league all season. Will the game pan out as expected?"
,action,"This could be a historic day for Madrid, who extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 38 games with victory over Sevilla in midweek. Barcelona hold the record streak for Spanish clubs at 39 matches, and their great rivals can equal that tally here!"
,action,"The big team news is, of course, in the home camp, with Zinedine Zidane making four changes to the side that breezed past Sevilla in the Copa del Rey. That includes an all new front three, and the return of Cristiano Ronaldo. Marcelo continues to deputise for injured captain Sergio Ramos. Granada, playing their first game of 2017, have six changes."
,action,"Subs: Oier, Silva, Atzili, Bueno, Javi Marquez, Jon Toral, Ponce."
,action,"Granada: Ochoa, Tito, Tabanou, Lomban, Ruben Vezo, Gabriel Silva, Boga, Samper, Uche, Pereira, Kravets."
,action,"Subs: Kiko Casilla, Danilo, Fabio Coentrao, Rodriguez, Asensio, Morata, Mariano."
,action,"Real Madrid: Navas, Carvajal, Varane, Nacho, Marcelo, Modric, Casemiro, Kroos, Isco, Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo."
,action,Welcome to our live text commentary of Real Madrid's Liga clash with lowly Granada from the Santiago Bernabeu!
