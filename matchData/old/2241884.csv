,action,"And that wraps it up here at Anfield. Liverpool get the win they deserve thanks to goals from substitute Origi and Milner from the spot. They move top of the table for two hours at least, with Chelsea soon to kick off against Tottenham. That's all we've got time for, thanks for joining us."
90'+2',substitution,"Substitution Georginio Wijnaldum Ben Woodburn .First appearance in the Premier Leaue for Ben Woodburn, as Wijnaldum departs."
90'+1',penalty-goal,"Penalty Goal James Milner.MILNER SEALS IT! The makeshift left-back steps up to the spot and buries it, sending the keeper the wrong way. Fifth EPL penalty for him, and game over."
89',action,"LIVERPOOL HAVE A PENALTY! Mane's searing pace takes him past Denayer down the wing, and Ndong comes across with a late challenge in the area to foul him. Easy decision."
87',substitution,"Substitution Roberto Firmino Barbosa de Oliveira Lucas Pezzini-Leiva .Firmino will be substituted late on, and Lucas enters the game."
85',action,"Liverpool are now closing the game out in a far more disciplined manner, only attacking when they have the numerical advantage after winning the ball in midfield. Five minutes to go."
83',action,"Determined work by Mane sees him win the ball in midfield and turn defence into attack. He plays it to Origi who then lays it off for Can, who just about executes a roulette before losing the ball."
81',action,"Liverpool have taken their foot off the pedal for a moment as they put more focus on keeping the door locked at the back. It's now or never for Sunderland you feel, with less than 10 minutes remaining."
79',substitution,"Substitution Duncan Watmore Adnan Januzaj .The Scot follows that up by summoning Adnan Januzaj off the bench, with Watmore making way."
79',substitution,Substitution Steven Pienaar Lynden Gooch .Double change here for Sunderland. Moyes' first move is to take off Pienaar and introduce Lynden Gooch.
77',action,"Klopp is still urging his team forward late on here, as the last thing they want is to sit back and allow Sunderland encouragement to commit numbers in attack. Offense is the best form of defence."
75',goal,Goal Divock Okoth Origi.WHAT A GOAL FROM THE SUBSTITUTE! Liverpool finally have their breakthrough as Origi cuts inside of Watmore and curls a lovely effort inside the far post from a considerable angle!
75',assist,Assist Jordan Henderson.Henderson will be credited with the assist.
72',action,"WASTED! Henderson takes charge of the free-kick, but he fails to find the target. It was such a good position too, and the way the Sunderland defence set up it was almost like they expected that to hit the target!"
70',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Steven Pienaar.The yellow cards are coming thick and fast in the second half, and Pienaar is cautioned for bringing down Firmino right on the edge of the Sunderland penalty area."
69',action,"HUGE SCRAMBLE! From the free-kick, Sunderland play their way into the penalty area, with Anichebe getting the ball to Watmore at the back post, but Karius is again quick to snuff out the danger! The visitors keep the ball alive with the keeper out of position, but fail to get a shot on target."
67',yellow-card,Yellow Card Dejan Lovren.Lovren is the latest player to get booked after fouling Defoe.
66',action,"INCHES AWAY! Firmino cuts onto his right boot and curls an in-swinging cross towards the head of Origi. The forward nods it back into the path of Can, who pummels the ball the wrong side of the post."
64',yellow-card,"Yellow Card John O'Shea.Origi has done well to draw fouls in the second half, and O'Shea takes one for the team, bringing down the substitute."
62',action,"Klopp is clearly not content with matters out on the pitch, and takes it upon himself to wave his hands like a madman to pump up the crowd. It's had the desired effect as the noise levels raise."
60',yellow-card,Yellow Card Lamine Koné.Kone takes a piece out of Origi from behind and duly gets booked.
59',action,"PICKFORD CALLED INTO ACTION AGAIN! Firmino takes matters into his own hands, beating Pienaar with some trickery before taking aim, but the goalkeeper, who has not put a finger out of place, is all over it."
57',action,It's all Liverpool in the second period as they set up camp outside the Sunderland penalty area. THe ball keeps getting thrown back at them whenever they penetrate into the 18-yard box though.
54',action,"OOOH SO CLOSE! Can sets that play in motion with some keep-ups before lobbing a terrific ball over the back four for Wijnaldum, who lashes it across the face of goal, where James Milner is inches away from tapping it in."
52',action,"Karius has to be on his toes to get to a long ball before Duncan Watmore. The keeper has hardly had anything to do in this game, but he showed good concentration there to spot that danger."
50',action,That's twice now that some dangerous balls have been flashed across the face of goal by the home side. We've seen that fairly often this game - a Liverpool player getting to the byline but his teammates slow to arrive in support.
48',action,"Liverpool pick up where they left off, controlling the ball and the tempo of the game, but they continue to find the door locked at the back. Second game in a row that they're struggling for clear-cut chances."
46',action,Off we go again!
,action,"And that will do it from Anfield for now as Liverpool fail to break down a resolute Sunderland in a stalemate. Despite all of their possession, Pickford hasn't been troubled as much as he would have expected. To compound matters, Coutinho has gone off with a nasty-looking ankle injury, which has deprived them of some creativity. I'll be back soon."
45'+2',action,"There's just no room for Liverpool at the edge of the area as both Wijnaldum and Firmino find the door shut. The Brazilian eventually clips one in to Emre Can, who tries to do too much with his header as it drops wide of the post with Mane failing to catch up."
45',action,Anichebe is back defending to show good anticipation to intercept Origi's throughball intended for Clyne. You have to admire the way that Sunderland have worked for each other as a team.
43',action,"Clyne and Wijnaldum try to link with a one-two down the right, but O'Shea is out to greet the former. He gives away a corner which he swore was a goal-kick but his arguments are moot as Liverpool fail to make anything of it."
41',action,"Sunderland started the game in a 4-4-2 formation, but Anichebe has quickly shifted out to the left-hand side to form a 4-5-1. It's providing an extra man to keep Clyne occupied out wide and prevent him from overlapping."
39',action,"SHOULD HAVE HIT THE TARGET! Jordan Henderson stands over a free-kick, and Lovren sneaks around to the back post to get his head to it, but he flashes it the wrong side of the post."
37',action,"Coutinho's departure has coincided with a dip in the tempo of the match, which will suit Sunderland just fine. It's been a committed defensive effort from Sunderland so far in this one."
34',substitution,"Substitution Philippe Coutinho Correia Divock Okoth Origi .That will indeed be the end of the game for Coutinho, who is strapped to the stretcher with his right ankle in a brace. He's applauded off the pitch as Divock Orgi replaces him."
32',action,"Doesn't look very good for Coutinho, who has stayed down following a challenge with Didier Ndong. He's in some pain, and the stretcher is out on the field. Klopp is active on the bench to ready a substitute."
30',action,"Not sure what that was about from Dejan Lovren. It was neither a shot or a long diagonal into the area. What it ended up being was catching practice for Pickford, who has looked confident this afternoon."
28',action,"WIDE OF THE MARK! Nathaniel Clyne pops up deep on the right but his teammates are a little slow to get forward in support. He squares to Georginio Wijnaldum eventually, whose shot doesn't trouble the keeper."
26',action,"Terrible decision from Sadio Mane. The winger initially beat Pienaar down the right and then benefited from a missed interception to scamper into space. He had time to pick his spot or set up Roberto Firmino, but rushed it and sent the ball harmlessly into Pickford's territory."
24',action,"Patrick van Aanholt takes the ball on his chest and lashes it towards goal from range, but he cuts across it and it goes wide. He's scored a few this season, and has looked good on the left flank."
22',action,"Composed defending in the air from the visiting team once again. Mane's in-swinging cross is headed away by Ndong. Henderson picks up the pieces, but his lofted return ball is plucked out of the sky by Pickford."
20',action,"Milner has the opportunity to cross twice in quick succession, but both times, they're gobbled up by the Sunderland defence. It's not an attacking approach that Klopp would be too happy with."
18',action,"FINE SAVE! Billy Jones whacks the ball forward from his own half and Joel Matip hesitates, which allows Steven Pienaar a pocket of space to charge into. However, Karius is off his line to block the finish and spare his defender's blushes."
16',action,"Jermain Defoe collects the ball up front, but lacking support, he decides to go for goal, with Loris Karius not troubled by that effort. Rare respite for the visiting side after spending most of the game so far defending."
14',action,INTO THE ARMS OF PICKFORD! A nifty move from the home side sees Coutinho link with Henderson before playing the ball to Wijnaldum. He takes it on the turn but the Sunderland keeper is well positioned.
11',action,"Moyes wasn't kidding when he promised to park the bus. All the visiting players are back in their own half, and are looking very disciplined to prevent Liverpool with a clear route forward."
9',action,"Liverpool continue to press high up the field in typical Klopp fashion. Clyne picks the pocket of Watmore and gets the ball to Firmino who tries his luck from 20 yards, but it's swallowed by Pickford."
7',action,"Anichebe uses his upper body strength to momentarily hold off Henderson, but he then loses out and doesn't get a foul call. Coutinho springs onto the loose ball and tries to let fly from the top of the box, but Kone makes a good challenge."
5',action,"Van Aanholt does well to drive into space down the left flank, before dropping it off to Anichebe and continuing his run down the wing. However, the striker runs into trouble as he has three defenders for company."
3',action,"Recently retired Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard is in attendance tonight. The next step for the ex-Reds skipper is unclear, but Klopp has promised that the door is always open for him to have a role at the club."
1',action,We're off!
,action,"Despite the goalless draw with Southampton last time out, Klopp sticks with the same XI. Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana are both injured. For the visitors, Papy Djilobodji's suspension sees John O'Shea return, while Steven Pienaar steps in for long-term casualty Paddy McNair."
,action,"Sunderland subs: Mannone, Larsson, Khazri, Manquillo, Gooch, Januzaj, Love."
,action,"Sunderland (4-4-2): Pickford; Jones, Kone, O'Shea, Van Aanholt; Pienaar, Denayer, Ndong, Watmore; Anichebe, Defoe."
,action,"Liverpool subs: Lucas, Mignolet, Moreno, Origi, Ejaria, Woodburn, Klavan."
,action,"Liverpool (4-3-3): Karius; Clyne, Matip, Lovren, Milner; Wijnaldum, Henderson, Can; Mane, Firmino, Coutinho."
,action,David Moyes presided over back-to-back wins at Sunderland to crack a 10-game winless streak. He pledged to park the bus against Jurgen Klopp's purring Reds here at Anfield as they try to push out of the relegation zone.
,action,"Jurgen Klopp's men are unbeaten in their last 10 league games, although a draw with Southampton last time out surrendered the EPL lead to Chelsea. However, their last encounter at home ended in a 6-1 thrashing of Watford."
,action,"Hello and welcome to our live commentary of the Premier League match between Liverpool and Sunderland. The Reds want to return to winning ways, and face a side that recently broke a 10-match run without victory."
