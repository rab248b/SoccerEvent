,action,"FULL-TIME! Burnley win another home game in the Premier League, with a goal from Boyd just enough to edge the Clarets over the line. Goals from the ex-Hull man, as well as Hendrick and Ward, proved just about enough during a hard-fought game. Afobe and Daniels made things interesting late on, with the former having a goal disallowed wrongly, but the hosts scrape a much-needed victory. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+2',substitution,"; Boyd is replaced by Tarkowski for the dying minutes, with Dyche hoping to shut up shop for the last few minutes."
90'+1',assist,"Assist Marc Pugh ; Pugh is the man to feed an incisive pass into the penalty area, but Daniels does the rest with aplomb."
90'+1',goal,"Goal Charlie Daniels ; GOOOOOOOAL! DANIELS MAKES IT 3-2! Bournemouth take a corner short yet again, with the left-back found in space inside the box. He turns and thumps a wonderful finish into the top-right corner, and Dyche is stood disbelieving on the sideline."
90',action,"Arter sees a shot charged down on the edge of the box by Marney, as Burnley sit back and defend their lead. There are four minutes of stoppage time."
89',action,"RULED OUT! Francis and Ake rise well to meet a free-kick delivery from deep for Bournemouth, but Keane does well to deny the latter. The away side then pick out Afobe over the top moments later, but the Englishman is penalised for handball. It appeared to bounce off his chest! The former Arsenal man rattles home a close-range finish, but it won't count!"
87',action,"Boyd races down the right-hand side, in an attempt to waste a bit of time, with Lowton then able to release Barnes into the channel. The substitute holds it up, before the right-back darts infield and gets into the box to receive a return pass. He cuts a ball back to the edge of the box, which Arfield can only drag terribly wide of the left-hand post."
85',action,"OFFSIDE! Boyd releases Gray to the right byline, but hesitated for a second, which saw the substitute stray narrowly offside. He squares it and Marney prods home from close-range, but it won't count. Not sure what Boyd was thinking of there."
84',action,"Bournemouth are pressing on again, with a low cross from the left-hand side hammered clear by Keane. Moments later, Daniels finds Pugh out wide, and the substitute wins a corner. The visitors work it short, but Boyd and Hendrick combine to frustrate the substitute. Burnley race forward on the counter, with Gray released in behind, but the Englishman shoots straight at Boruc from a tight angle!"
82',action,"NO PENALTY! Pugh gets into the penalty area from the left-hand side, before asking for a spot-kick. Lowton appeared to have been wrongfooted, but the referee deems that there wasn't any real contact."
81',substitution,"; Fraser is replaced by Pugh for the late stages, as Howe tries to freshen things up going forward."
81',action,"Ward is happy to let a loose ball run out of play, as Burnley try to wind down the clock and take the momentum out of this game. Dyche and company are happy to just grind out what will be another welcome three points. Gray races into the clear and polishes off an easy chance, but the substitute is denied by the offside flag."
79',action,"Narrowly over 10 minutes remain for Bournemouth to make a comeback, but they did manage to do so in the 4-3 thriller last time out against Liverpool. The away side slowly build from the back, with Wilshere picking out Daniels on the left, before Fraser cuts into the box. The wide man shoots with a curling attempt, but bends the ball just shy of the far post."
77',action,"Burnley look a lot more relaxed now, with all of Bournemouth pressure and bright play in this second half coming out to nothing. Gray is released to the right byline and wins a corner from Ake, and that's the Clarets first one of the half. That shows how much pressure they've been under since the interval."
75',assist,"Assist Andre Gray ; Gray plays a neat backheel in behind Francis, with Boyd quickest to react after making a smart run across Ake."
75',goal,"Goal George Boyd ; GOOOOOOOOAL! GREAT FINISH FROM BOYD! Ward manages to place a low pass into Gray's feet, with the substitute able to play a beautiful flick in behind Bournemouth's lines. The wide man drives into the box and thumps a clinical effort across the face of goal and into the bottom-right corner! Bournemouth are stunned."
74',action,"Dyche is desperately keeping his players working hard, but thus far his strike force haven't been able to link up too well, which is leading to his defence being put under a lot of pressure. Fraser races down the left and tries to feed a low pass into King, but Mee reacts quicker than the ex-Blackburn forward and clears."
72',substitution,"; King replaces Gosling for the last 20 minutes, which will see Wilshere play a more withdrawn role. The Norway international will try and use his pace to help link up with Afobe up top."
70',action,"Hendricks plays a great pass into Gray's feet, but a stray ball from the striker can't find Barnes. Only 20 minutes remain in this contest, and it is delicately poised. One error and there could be a goal falling either way. Wilshere is looking bright with his fresh legs in midfield."
68',yellow-card,"Yellow Card George Boyd ; Boyd picks up a yellow card for a scrappy, cynical foul. Burnley are on the back foot and it's a case of needs must now."
68',action,"What a chance for Gray! The substitute is fed into the penalty area, but the Englishman can only shoot straight down Boruc's thoat. He was found by a flick-on, and really should have done better with that. Dyche will be wondering how his side aren't 3-1 up here."
66',action,"Wilshere and Afobe link up on the edge of the box, but an eventual cross from the former is flicked clear by Marney. Adam Smith then tries to slide a pass in behind for Afobe to chase, but Boyd tracks back well to get the right side of the Bournemouth striker. The Cherries are piling the pressure on."
64',action,"Burnley are under heavy pressure, but Heaton hasn't had anything to do in this second period yet. Howe's men are really looking to pin the hosts back, with Wilshere coming into the game with the ability to exploit any gaps. Ward plays a terrible pass back to Keane, forcing his centre-back to race out and thump a clearance down the line."
62',action,"Bournemouth are moving the ball at pace and with intent, and Burnley are sat deep and defending well. Afobe is picked out by a long ball over the top from Wilshere, with Afobe going down claiming a push from Keane. There wasn't much in that at all, though. The ex-Arsenal man was looking for a foul, as he didn't think he had the legs to catch up with the pass."
60',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Dan Gosling ; Gosling picks up a booking for the away side, as the former Newcastle midfielder is outfoxed by Hendrick."
59',substitution,"; Wilson is replaced by Wilshere, who will drop into the hole behind Afobe for the last half an hour or so."
58',action,"Arter blazes over the target from long-range, as Bournemouth continue to dig out a few half-chances in quick succession. This game has burst into life, with both coaches trying to alter the shape of the contest. Cook meets a deep cross, but the centre-back can only direct a header towards Heaton's arms."
56',action,"Over the top from Barnes! The Austrian forward is found by a looping pass forward from Lowton, but can only slide in to drag a volleyed effort above the target. That's not a bad introduction for the substitute, and Turf Moor responds."
55',substitution,"; Defour is replaced by Barnes, as Dyche opts to switch to a 4-4-2."
55',substitution,"; Gray is introduced up top for the hosts, in a straight swap for the target man of Vokes."
54',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Scott Arfield ; Howe's half-time words have had a rousing effect on this Bournemouth team, who have been excellent since the restart. Arfield is given a yellow card, after sliding in very late on Francis, and the tide is turning in Lancashire."
52',action,"Dyche isn't very happy with the referee, as Lowton is penalised for a tough tackle on Fraser that the Burnley boss was applauding maniacally on the touchline. Adam Smith bends a cross towards the back post from the right, but the ex-Aston Villa right-back heads clear. Afobe then does well to win a corner from Boyd, but Bournemouth are reluctant to sweep the ball into the area based on the hosts' height advantage."
50',action,"Lowton finds Vokes' feet with a quick throw, but the Welshman is forced away from goal. Arfield manages to wriggle a pass through into the path of the onrushing Hendrick, but the Canada international was caught narrowly offside while doing it. Burnley are on the back foot a little here."
48',action,"Wide from Afobe! The Englishman has a chance that is almost identical to the one that he scored from in the first half, except from the opposite flank. He drags a left-footed effort beyond the back post, which doesn't have Heaton worried at all. Good start from Bournemouth!"
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half at Turf Moor! Burnley have let Bournemouth back into this game, and we should have quite the spectacle on our hands as we head into the next 45 minutes of action."
,action,"HALF-TIME! Dyche is absolutely livid, and goes straight to the referee when the whistle goes. He points at his watch, and he has a case, as that goal came 20 seconds after the stipulated one minute of first-half stoppage time. Hendrick and Ward gave Burnley a commanding 2-0 lead, but a strike from Afobe has made things interesting."
45'+2',assist,Assist Simon Francis ; Francis keeps his cool and finds his teammate in a pocket of space deep in the penalty area.
45'+2',goal,"Goal Benik Afobe ; GOOOOOOOOOAL! AFOBE MAKES IT 2-1! A glimmer of hope for the away side! Bournemouth work the ball down the right-hand side brilliantly. Francis cuts back a great cross, with Afobe guiding a low finish into the bottom-left corner from close range. That wasn't in the script!"
45',action,"Adam Smith bends a cross towards the right byline, but the ball sails over the danger zone and behind for a goal-kick. There is one minute of stoppage time."
44',action,"Afobe claims for handball, as Defour kicks a clearance into his own face, but the referee isn't interested. The Belgian midfielder is quickly back to his feet and joins a break, and is fed into the clear behind the Bournemouth back four. Fortunately for them, the flag is up for offside."
42',action,"Marney clips a long ball forward for Vokes to chase, but the Welshman isn't having the close support that he enjoyed in the first 20 minutes, and loses out to Francis. Fraser overlaps down the right, and drills in a low cross for Bournemouth, but Mee is present at the near post to thump clear."
40',action,"Ake bends a cross in from the left, but Mee rises highest to clear it, before Arter has the chance to shoot from long-range. The Irishman's effort is deflected, and loops wide of the right-hand post, but it did have Heaton worried. The resulting set-piece is dealt with be Keane, with Burnley then earning themselves a free-kick due to a scrappy coming together in their penalty box."
38',action,"Bournemouth win themselves a free-kick in a dangerous area, as niggling fouls continue to be a theme of this combative first half at Turf Moor. Adam Smith shoots, and threatens to find the top corner, but Heaton dives full-stretch to his left to push the ball over the bar! Great stop."
36',action,"Arfield bends a free-kick delivery into the box from the right flank, but Boyd is muscled off the ball by Gosling. Bournemouth race forward on the break, with Francis trying to make a delivery from out wide, but Marney covers across to block. Moments later, Gosling tries to drill in a cross, but Mee makes a timely interception."
34',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Harry Arter ; Arter picks up the first booking of the game, with the Republic of Ireland international losing his footing and making a cynical tackle in midfield. Moments later, Gosling is penalised for clipping Hendrick's heels."
32',action,"Cook drives forward for the away side, but Adam Smith can't manage to make the most of a flicked pass out wide from the Bournemouth centre-back. Howe's men are looking to up the tempo and cause some problems, with a throughball angled through towards Afobe. Fraser stabs the pass in behind, but Heaton is confident enough to let it run out for a goal-kick."
30',action,"Ward has the chance to lift a long ball into the penalty box from deep on the left-hand side, which he promptly does. Afobe and Fraser combine to clear the danger, but Marney is quick to react and deny the Bournemouth wide man from making any forward progress. Dyche's midfield five is having the desired effect so far at Turf Moor."
28',action,"Fraser tries to escape down the left-hand side, but Defour shuffles across to rob the young Scot of the ball. Bournemouth are struggling to break out of their own half, with Burnley first to any second ball in and around the midfield third. Howe's men look shellshocked, they've had a dismal first half an hour."
26',action,"Arfield is picked out by a fantastic ball down the right channel, and bursts into the penalty area, but Boruc is off his line very quickly to claim ahead of the Canadian midfielder. Dyche's style is reaping the rewards so far, with Bournemouth being bullied out of this game."
24',action,"Bournemouth are really struggling to piece together any attacks, with their frustrations starting to show. Francis first dives into a full-bodied challenge, before Adam Smith puts in a terrible, late tackle in the midfield third. No cards are shown, but the referee will have no option but to go for his book next time."
22',action,"Bournemouth are really struggling to deal with Burnley's direct football, with Vokes having the stature and size to tower above Ake. Dyche's men are being pragmatic in their play, with their five-man midfield ensuring that the away side can't get the ball down and play as they may like."
20',action,"Over the bar from Vokes! The Wales international is picked out by a curling cross from the right-hand side from Arfield, but can't keep it down. Despite opening up a two-goal gap in this first half, Burnley smell blood and are keen to try and widen their advantage before the half-hour mark."
19',action,"Heaton is happy to take his time over any free-kicks that his side are awarded, with Burnley now in a very comfortable position indeed. The goalkeeper launches a long ball forward, which is met by Keane, with the ex-Manchester United centre-back seeing a great header pushed around the post by Boruc!"
17',action,"Bournemouth are left with a lot to do now. Francis bends in a cross, which is nodded half-clear, with Ake then seeing a half-volley blocked from 20 yards out. Cook then takes a long throw on the left flank, but Mee and Marney combine to clear, before Afobe is beaten to a swirling delivery from the same wing by the man who launched the ball into the area originally."
16',goal,"Goal Stephen Ward ; GOOOOOOOAL! WARD MAKES IT TWO! The former Wolves left-back initially wins a corner on the right-hand side, which is swung into the box. Mee heads an attempt goalwards, which Boruc parries, with the Republic of Ireland international quickest to react and bundle home a finish from a few yards out. Awful defending from Bournemouth."
15',action,"After a slow and fairly negative start from the hosts, they've grabbed themselves a fantastic breakthrough goal. Howe looks pensieve on the sidelines, as all of Bournemouth's good early work has been undone in one swing of Hendrick's boot. Immediately, the Clarets happy to take their time over dead-ball situations."
13',assist,"Assist Matthew Lowton ; Lowton clips a lofted pass down the line, and it sits up beautifully for Hendrick to strike."
13',goal,"Goal Jeff Hendrick ; GOOOOOOOOOOOAL! WHAT A GOAL FROM HENDRICK! The ex-Derby midfielder takes aim from long-range, and dips a low finish into the top-right corner from outside of the box. It is a beautiful half-volley, and Boruc has got absolutely no chance of saving that."
12',action,"Over the top from Gosling! The Englishman lines up a shot from long-range, but shoots powerfully just above the crossbar. Bournemouth have been pushing on well, with Burnley's set-up and system leaving Vokes rather Defour."
10',action,"Afobe opens play out the right-hand side, with Arter trying to deliver a neat throughball, but Heaton is once again there to collect. Bournemouth threaten down the right moments later, with Gosling drilling in a low cross. Wilson tees up A. Smith, but he sees a shot blocked."
8',action,"Chance for Afobe! The Englishman shoots on the volley from close-range, but Heaton is able to gobble up the ball underneath his own crossbar. The effort wriggles out of the goalkeeper's grasp, but he quickly grabs it ahead of Wilson. Already the ex-Wolves man is trying to prove Howe right to give him his first Premier League start of the campaign."
6',action,"Vokes plays a good flick-on, but Daniels does well to recover and then hoof a clearance up the line. This game has been rather cagey so far, with both teams afraid of making the first mistake. Ake is almost robbed of the ball on the edge of his own box, as Arfield pressures him, but a deflection cannons off the Canada international and bounces behind for a goal-kick."
4',action,"Wide from Gosling! Wilson is beaten in the air on the edge of the penalty area, with Keane nodding half-clear. The ex-Blackpool midfielder bursts towards the box and shoots wide of the target, before Burnley have a chance. Ake and Boruc get mixed up deep in their own defensive third, due to an interesting pass-back, but this time the Poland international doesn't make an error."
2',action,"Hendrick goes down in the penalty area, under a push from Arter, but the referee doesn't believe that it is enough contact to result in a spot-kick! The home fans claim for it, but the visitors get nothing in response. Early drama at Turf Moor!"
1',action,"We are underway in the first half! Burnley will be looking to keep their good form going at Turf Moor, as they attempt to put some daylight between themselves and the bottom three, while Bournemouth will be quick out of the blocks after their staggering comeback last week."

,action,"TEAM NEWS: Nathan Ake features at centre-back for Bournemouth, with Charlie Daniels returning at left-back. Adam Smith is on the right wing once again, which pushes Simon Francis to right-back, with Dan Gosling continuing to deputise for Andrew Surman in midfield. Jack Wilshere is benched, with Callum Wilson joined by Benik Afobe up front. Ryan Fraser gets a rare start, and is preferred to Jordon Ibe in Junior Stanislas' injury absence."
,action,"TEAM NEWS: Tom Heaton shakes off an injury problem to feature in goal for the home side, but Johann Gudmundsson is sidelined. Matt Lowton starts at right-back, with George Boyd and Scott Arfield deployed in the wide areas. Sam Vokes is left on his own up top, with Andre Gray on the bench, as Steven Defour, Dean Marney and Jeff Hendrick make up a central midfield three."
,action,"Bournemouth have won just one of their last nine away outings in the Premier League, while Burnley have been in much better form at Turf Moor. Sean Dyche's side have won three of their last five on familiar turf, with the two defeats coming against Arsenal and Manchester City respectively."
,action,"Burnley currently find themselves three points clear of the relegation zone, but if their poor form continues, they could well be sucked into the mire. Howe is returning to a former club, and will hope that it will stand him in good stead for a match which could help the Cherries leapfrog Everton in the table and continue their march into the upper reaches of the Premier League."
,action,"Hello and welcome to live coverage of Bournemouth's long away trip to face Burnley in the Premier League, with both teams in rather contrasting form of late. While the hosts are on a run of three consecutive defeats, Eddie Howe's men managed a 4-3 victory over Liverpool last time out, which is bound to have their confidence sky-high."
