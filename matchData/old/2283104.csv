90'+3',action,"Luis appeals to the referee for handball as his cross is blocked by Femenia, but the calls are waived away. That could be the last chance for Diego Simeone’s side."
90'+1',action,We’re into three minutes of added time here.
88',action,"HUGE SAVE FROM MOYA!!!! Alaves break forwards quickly through Edgar who slips the ball into the path of Hernandez on the overlap, but Moya spreads himself well and gets enough on the left-back’s shot to send it wide, and prevent Hernandez scoring against his parent club."
86',action,Torres is brought down by Laguardia handing Atletico a free-kick 25 yards out from goal just to the right of centre. Griezmann goes for goal but fires it straight over the bar.
84',substitution,; A third and final change for Alaves now as Toquero is replaced by Carlos Vigaray.
82',yellow-card,Yellow Card Deyverson Brum Silva Acosta ; Deyverson commits a needless foul on Koke and receives a yellow card as a result. Koke then swings in the free-kick himself but Pacheco comes out well to claim it.
81',action,"Koke turns smartly on the edge of the box after good work from Torres out wide on the left, but his shot is a tame one and goes straight into the grateful arms of Pacheco."
78',action,"HUGE CHANCE FOR GAITAN!!!!! The winger is clean through on goal with just Pacheco in the Alaves goal to beat, but he tries to take the ball around the Alaves keeper, who reads it perfectly and gets his hands to the ball, knocking it away from Gaitan."
77',substitution,; That chance will be Camarasa’s last action of the game as he’s replaced by Christian Santos.
75',action,"Camarasa is involved in absolutely everything for Alaves here, with two good chances inside a minute falling his way. Having broken down the left and seen a low shot easily saved by Moya at the near post, Alaves win the ball back and flood forward in numbers, but the ball just breaks away from the midfielder as he’s about to shoot from 12 yards out."
74',action,"Deyverson does superbly well to prevent the ball going out for a goal kick as he directs his header back towards Camarasa, who hits an ambitious first-time volley from a tight angle on the left which dips just wide of the far post."
71',action,"Alaves win another corner as Vrsaljko heads the ball behind under good pressure from Laguardia. Camarasa swings in the resultant cross and Feddal gets up really well on the edge of the six yard box, but he can’t get on top of it and the ball skims off the top of his head and away from goal."
68',action,"Super save from Moya!! Having just come on, Edgar fires a fierce low shot towards the far corner from 25 yards out, and Moya has to be at full stretch to his left to tip it round the post."
66',action,Deyverson gets up really well to direct a header towards goal from the edge of the area. It was never likely to trouble Moya from that distance but the Atletico keeper was scrambling across goal to watch it go wide of the post nonetheless.
65',substitution,"; Alaves are now going to make their first change, possibly with the Copa del Rey semi-final in midweek in mind, as Gomez is replaced by Edgar Ortega."
64',action,Diego Simeone is crouching down at the edge of his technical area as Koke’s corner comes to nothing for his side. He certainly looks concerned here but his side have improved in this second half.
62',substitution,"; Diego Simeone appears to be rolling the dice in search of all three points now as he makes his third and final change, which sees Fernando Torres come on in place of Carrasco."
60',substitution,"; Atletico are making their second change now with Angel Correa replacing Gameiro, who in truth has done very little."
58',action,"Close from Deyverson! Toquero works half a yard of space for himself with a clever turn on the right and whips a good cross in towards Deyverson, but the striker is well in front of the near post and is only able to flick his header across the face of goal and out for a goal kick."
57',action,"Camarasa is everywhere for Alaves here, this time forcing Koke into a mistake and winning his side a corner. Atletico are able to clear it with ease but the midfielder’s influence is certainly growing."
56',substitution,; Atletico are being forced into a change now as Gimenez leaves the field in tears with what looks to be a groin injury. Stefan Savic comes on in his place at centre-back.
54',yellow-card,Yellow Card Marcos Llorente Moreno ; Llorente becomes the second player to go into the referee’s book now as he brings down Griezmann just inside the Alaves half. The French striker was just too quick for Llorente there as he turned away from him.
51',action,"CLOSE!! Camarasa gets in behind Gimenez inside the Atletico box following a good flicked on header from Toquero, but the midfielder is forced wide and his attempted chip over the onrushing Moya goes into the side netting."
48',action,"The home crowd express their displeasure as Alaves knock the ball out of play to allow Saul to receive treatment, only for Atletico to drill the ball into the corner handing Alaves a throw-in in a difficult position."
46',action,"A bright start to the second half here for Atletico as Koke lifts a floated free-kick towards the back post where Gimenez gets his head to it, but there are no Atletico players following up and Pacheco can easily gather the ball."
46',action,Kick-off! Alaves get the second half underway.
,action,"Diego Simeone will be pleased to have got his side into the dressing room at 0-0 and may well turn to his bench early on in the second half, particularly if Alaves continue to enjoy the same amount of space in wide areas. Mauricio Pellegrino meanwhile will be asking for more of the same from his Alaves players, particularly from his full-backs who’ve got forward well throughout the first-half."
,action,"Alaves have dominated the majority of the first half here at the Mendizorrotza Stadium, and came close to taking the lead when Laguardia hit the crossbar before Deyverson headed the rebound over the bar, while Atletico have struggled to get their two strikers involved in the game."
,action,Half-time: Deportivo Alaves 0-0 Atletico Madrid
45',yellow-card,Yellow Card José María Giménez de Vargas ; Gimenez is shown the first yellow card of the game for a crunching challenge on Deyverson. The defender protests with the referee but he can have few complaints in truth.
44',action,"Alaves are still seeing plenty of the ball here, but they appear to be settling for 0-0 at the break as the tempo has dropped significantly in the last few minutes."
42',action,The Alaves players are furious with the referee as he penalises Gomez for a high boot on Vrsaljko. It did appear that the Atletico right-back put his head pretty low to the ground there.
39',action,"Chance for Alaves!! The home side break quickly as Camarasa picks out Femenia in space on the right-hand edge of the box and the right back pulls a cross back towards Gomez who’s 15 yards out from goal, but the winger fails to keep the shot down and Moya watches it sail comfortably over his bar."
37',action,"Things just starting to get a little bit scrappy now as Atletico are awarded another free-kick just inside the Alaves half. Koke lifts the ball towards the back post, but Deyverson is able to hoist the ball high towards the Atletico half and away from danger."
35',action,Mauricio Pellegrino is deep in conversation with the fourth official following a foul on Gimenez from Camarasa close to halfway. The Alaves boss certainly doesn’t look too pleased with that decision.
33',action,"Carrasco robs the ball from Gomez and feeds Gaitan down the right. The winger then goes down under a challenge and picks up the ball feeling he’s been fouled, but the referees disagrees and penalises the Atletico player for handball."
30',action,"WHAT A MISS!!!! Hernandez swings in a free-kick from the left following a foul from Vrsaljko on Deyverson, and Laguardia hooks a volley onto the bar from six yards out before Deyverson heads the ball over the bar on the rebound with an open goal in front of him!!"
28',action,"Griezmann is starting to grow into the game now as the ball breaks to him on the edge of the penalty area after loose control from Gaitan, but his curling shot is straight at Pacheco who catches it with ease."
26',action,"The first real sign of Atletico’s counter-attacking capabilities on show now as Griezmann and Gameiro break forwards at pace, but Victor Laguardia recovers well to block the latter’s shot from just inside the box."
24',action,Alaves show plenty of patience knocking the ball around in midfield before releases Hernandez on the left. The full-back gets around the outside of Sime Vrsaljko but his cross is a poor one and goes straight into Moya’s arms.
22',action,"Diego Simone won’t be too pleased with the amount of space Gomez is getting at the far post here as he’s unmarked once again as he brings the ball down on his chest, but this time the flag goes up against him."
20',action,"Another half-chance for Gomez at the far post as he looks to strike a low left-footed effort towards goal from a tight angle, but he can’t connect cleanly with the shot and Gimenez clears the danger despite a momentary breakdown in communication with Moya."
19',action,"Koke swings in a free-kick from the left-hand side towards Griezmann at the near post, but the Frenchman can’t wrap his foot around the ball sufficiently on the slide and can only divert it out for a goal kick."
16',action,"Alaves are really starting to dominate the game now, this time Deyverson flicks a header on for Camarasa to latch on to, but Gimenez sticks a toe in to divert the ball out for a corner just as the midfielder was about to shoot from the edge of the box."
16',action,"Llorente has a go for goal from long range after Toquero’s cross was blocked, but the on-loan Real Madrid midfielder’s effort goes high over Moya’s goal."
13',action,"The first half chance for Atletico falls to Saul Niguez as he looks to direct a header towards goal, but the midfielder can’t generate enough power on the effort and it loops harmlessly wide of Fernando Pacheco’s goal from 12 yards out."
11',action,Alaves win a free-kick in a dangerous area as Jose Gimenez takes out Theo Hernandez close to the left-hand touchline. Gomez swings in the resultant cross but the Atletico defence are able to deal with the danger comfortably. It’s been a bright start from Alaves though.
8',action,"What a chance for Gomez!! Gaizka Toquero puts Kiko Femenia away into space on the right with a clever flick round the corner, and the right-back picks out Ibai Gomez who’s unmarked at the back post, but his shot is too close to Miguel Moya who palms it away before Deyverson fluffs the rebound wide."
6',action,"Victor Camarasa shows a good burst of pace to get down the outside of Diego Godin on the right-hand side, but he can’t pick out a teammate with the cross from the by-line and Atletico are easily able to clear."
3',action,"Kevin Gameiro looks to dance his way through the Alaves defence on the edge of the box, but the ball bounces up and hits him on the arm, prompting referee Ocon Arraiz to award Alaves the free-kick."
