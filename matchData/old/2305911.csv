,action,"The two sides were evenly matched in the first half, but Torino struggled after the break and, in the end, were second best to their cross-city rivals, who performed excellently. Higuain continually proved to be a thorn in the side of the home side's back line, whilst Dybala and Pjanic made a big difference for the Bianconeri after coming off the substitutes' bench. Torino fought hard but didn't quite have enough in the tank, with Ljajic and Falque both proving ineffective out wide."
,action,FULL-TIME: TORINO 1-3 JUVENTUS
90'+4',action,"It's all Torino at the moment as they desperately try to push forward and find a way back into the game deep inside the Juventus half of the pitch, but the visitors are easily able to snuff out the danger with very little effort. They've been great this afternoon and fully deserve all three points."
90'+2',goal,"Goal Miralem Pjanić ; GOAL! Pjanic wraps up the win for Juventus! Dybala cuts inside from the right wing and beats two defenders with ease before teeing up Higuain. The striker's close-range shot is well saved by Hart before the goalkeeper does the same with Pjanic's follow-up, but he's unable to keep out a third and the Bosnian makes it 3-1 with a side-footed strike into the right-hand corner of the net."
90'+1',action,"A poor touch from Boye gifts the ball to Lemina, who immediately flies forward. He beats two players and heads towards the corner flag, but he's quickly put under pressure and is unable to keep the ball from rolling out of play."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be four minutes of added time.
88',action,"Higuain almost wraps up his hat-trick! Dybala cuts inside from the right wing and sends a dangerous cross into the middle of the Torino penalty area and towards Higuain. The striker beats Zappacosta to the ball and immediately unleashes a thumping strike, but, off balance, he ends up sending it over the top of the crossbar."
86',action,"Lemina twists and turns in the middle of the pitch before slotting a clever through-ball into the path of Higuain on the edge of the box, but the pass is slightly overhit and fails to find the Argentine before being cut out by Hart."
84',action,"Torino immediately try to push forward from the restart as they attempt to find a way back into the game, but Juventus have plenty of bodies back to deal with the danger before breaking forward once again."
82',goal,"Goal Gonzalo Gerardo Higuaín ; GOAL! What a strike by Higuain! A wonderful lofted pass forward from Chiellini finds Higuain, who, on the edge of the penalty area, out-muscles and spins past Barreca with ease before rifling a rocket of a shot past Hart."
81',substitution,"; Meanwhile, Cuadrado has made way for Pjanic for Juventus."
81',substitution,"; And the third is Martinez, who replaces Falque."
81',substitution,"; The second is Boye, who takes the place of Benassi."
81',substitution,"; With just under 10 minutes left to play, Torino have decided to make a triple substitution as they try to get back into the game. The first player to come on is Acquah, who replaces Baselli."
80',action,"Torino come back once again, this time through Benassi, who wins the home side another corner. This time it's sent short before a cross is whipped into the middle of the box, but Lichtsteiner is there to clear the danger with a header."
79',action,"Torino push forward on a well-worked attack before winning themselves a corner. Ljajic steps up and tries to pick out Castan at the far post, but his attempted cross is horribly hit and sails over everyone inside the penalty area and out for a throw-in on the right flank."
77',action,"Chance for Higuain! A half-hearted Torino attacking move comes to an end and allows Higuain to break forward on a quick counter-attack down the left wing, but, like Lemina a couple of minutes ago, he decides to shoot from distance instead of setting up a teammate and fails to trouble Hart."
75',action,"Lemina turns well in the middle of the pitch and does well to skip past his marker before charging towards the Torino box, but he decides to shoot instead of teeing up Higuain and fires his 25-yard strike well over the top of the crossbar."
74',action,"Inches away by Ljajic! Falque cuts inside from the right flank before picking out Ljajic with a great pass over to the left-hand side of the Juventus penalty area. He gets the better of Lichtsteiner before trying to curl a shot into the right-hand corner of the net, but it flies just a whisker wide of the goal after leaving Buffon rooted to the spot."
72',action,"Lichtsteiner, who has started to push further up the pitch, gets himself into a good position as he darts down the right wing. He then tries to pick out Higuain with a low cross, but it's underhit and easily intercepted by Rossettini."
71',substitution,"; Juventus have made their second change of the afternoon, with Dybala coming on to replace Mandzukic."
70',action,"Another great challenge by Chiellini! This time it's Rugani who gets caught out by the hosts and allows Rossettini to fly towards goal, but he's dispossessed by yet another impressive piece of defending from Chiellini."
69',action,"Great recovery by Chiellini! A terrible pass from the Juventus centre-back gifts possession to the home side, who quickly break forward. The ball is worked over to Falque, who then tries to penetrate the penalty area from the right wing, but Chiellini recovers brilliantly to dispossess the Spaniard with a great sliding tackle."
67',substitution,"; Juventus have decided to make their first substitution of the afternoon, with Sturaro making way for Lemina."
65',action,"Torino try to string together a lengthy series of passes as they attempt to carve out a chance on goal, but they haven't looked particularly dangerous over the last 20 minutes and Juventus are easily able to deal with the danger."
63',action,"Almost a great chance for Higuain! Khedira, who has been far more involved in the game since the break, charges towards the Torino box before teeing up Higuain, who is all alone in front of goal, but the striker is flagged offside as soon as he spins and shoots."
62',action,"Lichtsteiner goes down inside the penalty area, but nothing is given! The right-back flies into the right-hand side of the box after beating two players before taking on Castan, and there's a coming together between the two defenders. It seems to be accidental, but the Switzerland international isn't at all happy and screams for a penalty that the referee refuses to give."
60',action,"What a chance for Benassi! This time, Torino decide to play the free-kick short before teeing up Benassi on the edge of the penalty area, but the captain's thumping, first-time strike is blocked by Mandzukic as it flies towards the goal."
59',action,"Belotti, who has been incredibly impressive this afternoon, keeps battling hard inside the Juventus half of the pitch before winning his side another free-kick, this time over on the right wing after being dragged to the ground by Sandro."
57',action,"After what feels like an age, Ljajic steps up and curls a dangerous cross towards the far post that almost finds a Torino player in front of goal but is headed out for a corner by Sturaro at the vital moment."
56',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Daniele Rugani ; Rugani loses out to Belotti and ends up hauling the striker to the ground deep down the left wing, resulting in him seeing yellow before conceding a free-kick in a very dangerous position. Can Torino make it count?"
54',action,"Wild strike by Falque! Zappacosta beats Sturaro deep down the right wing before curling in a cross that, under pressure, Buffon can only punch out to Falque. The winger is in a pocket of space 25 yards away from goal and quickly shoots, but his strike is way too powerful and almost flies out of the stadium."
52',action,"After spending the first seven minutes of the second half on the back foot, Torino are finally able to push forward on an attack of their own. Benassi breaks toward the edge of the Juventus penalty area before chipping a lofted pass towards Falque, but the Spaniard is unable to reach the ball and loses out to Buffon."
51',action,"Juventus keep pushing forward and putting Torino under plenty of pressure. Khedira breaks into the right-hand side of the box after a slight mix-up at the back and looks to shoot, but just as he's about to do so, he's dispossessed by a wonderful sliding tackle from Castan, who had to time that perfectly."
50',action,"Lichtsteiner pushes forward over on the right flank before chipping a looping cross into the heart of the Torino box and towards Higuain, but Rossettini darts in front of the striker at the vital moment to stop him from reaching the ball."
48',action,"Cuadrado gets himself into a good position deep down the right wing and cuts inside before trying to pick out Khedira, but his pass is poor and can only find Falque. The Spaniard then darts forward as he tries to kick-start a counter-attack, but Chiellini is there to dispossess the winger with an excellent tackle."
47',action,"Early chance for Sturaro! A lofted pass forward is only half dealt with by Rossettini, allowing Khedira to nod the ball down to Sturaro. The midfielder is in a good position on the edge of the penalty area and spins quickly before shooting, but his strike is slightly mishit and flies well wide of the goal."
46',action,And we're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"It's been an evenly-fought and very entertaining opening 45 minutes, with both sides enjoying several good chances on goal. Despite sitting back and allowing Juventus to have most of the ball, it was arguably Torino who were the better of the two teams early on, and they deservedly took the lead thanks to a wonderfully well-worked goal. However, Higuain and Mandzukic have been a handful for the hosts' back four and quickly found an equaliser, meaning that there's still everything to play for heading into what should be a great second half."
,action,HALF-TIME: TORINO 1-1 JUVENTUS
45'+1',action,"Torino move the ball around nicely deep down inside the Juventus half of the pitch as they try to carve out a late chance on goal, but Barreca, who had done well to get down the left wing, brings a promising attacking move to a disappointing end with a misplaced pass on the edge of the penalty area."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be just one minute of added time.

42',action,"Zappacosta breaks down the right wing on a marauding run before taking on and beating Sandro, who had just come back on to the pitch. Sturaro is there to poke the ball away from the Torino full-back, however, before Sandro flies back to fully bring an end to another dangerous Torino attack."
40',action,"Sandro eventually makes his way off the pitch to receive further medical treatment and the game gets underway once again. Torino move the ball around quickly before Benassi tries to beat Sturaro, who is filling in for Sandro at left-back, but he's unable to do so and loses out before he can unleash a cross."
39',action,"Sandro is down injured over on the left wing and looks to be in some trouble. He seemed to receive a whack to the nose from Chiellini after battling in the air for the ball, as the centre-back didn't seem to release how close the Brazilian was to him."
37',action,"Ljajic steps up and unleashes a cross-cum-shot from the free-kick, but it's poorly hit by the winger and ends up bouncing straight into the hands of Buffon before it can find a Torino player inside the penalty area."
36',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Mario Mandžukić ; Mandzukic flies into the Zappacosta and seems to dispossess the right-back with a strong, but fair, sliding tackle. The referee doesn't agree, however, and immediately awards a free-kick to Torino in a dangerous position before booking the striker."
35',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Leandro Castán da Silva ; Castan is heavy-handed with a challenge in the middle of the pitch and gives away a free-kick before receiving a yellow card. The set-piece is taken quickly and worked over to Sandro, who then curls in a cross from the left flank, but the home side have enough bodies back to deal with the danger."
34',action,"Sturaro takes on Zappacosta on the left-hand side of the Torino penalty area but has to settle for a corner. Marchisio steps up and plays it short to Cuadrado, who then cuts inside and tees up Chiellini, but the defender's chipped pass over to Marchisio is poor and sails harmlessly out of play for a goal-kick."
32',action,"Zappacosta picks up the ball in a pocket of space over on the left wing inside the Torino half of the pitch and quickly tries to tee up Falque with a lofted pass down the flank, but Sandro sticks close to the Spaniard and forces both him and the ball out of play for a Juventus throw-in."
30',action,"Juventus patiently pass the ball around in the middle of the pitch before Marchisio curls a lofted pass over to Cuadrado on the left wing, but Barreca rises high above the Colombian to beat him to the ball."
28',assist,"Assist Mario Mandžukić ; Despite Juventus not quite being at their best yet, Mandzukic has nonetheless looked dangerous. He's got himself into several good positions and showed good understanding with Higuain to tee up the Argentine with a little back-heeled flick."
28',goal,"Goal Gonzalo Gerardo Higuaín ; GOAL! Juventus have equalised! Mandzukic and Higuain link up well on the edge of the Torino penalty area before the latter breaks through the hosts' disjointed back four, allowing him to go one-on-one and beat Hart with a smart, low finish."
26',action,"After a long period of Torino comes to an end, Mandzukic does well to win the ball back for Juventus before holding it up over on the right wing. He then skips past Barreca before trying to tee up Higuain, but Valdifiori is there to easily deal with the pass."
24',action,"Chance for Marchisio! A curling cross from Cuadrado finds Sturaro, but he's unable to control the ball and quickly loses out to Rossettini.

22',action,"Barreca does well to skip past Cuadrado with ease over on the left flank and heads towards the byline before chipping a cross towards Belotti, but he's slightly off balance and ends up sending the ball looping on to the roof of the net."
20',action,"Belotti embarks on a great run down the left wing before battling with Rugani, who ends up dragging the striker to the ground and giving away a free-kick. It's sent short before a cross is whipped towards Castan, but Rugani is there to head the ball away from danger."
18',action,"Juventus push forward from the restart and quickly work the ball forward to Mandzukic, who then shoots from the edge of the penalty area, but, once again, Hart is there to stop the Croatian striker's effort from finding the back of the net."
16',assist,"Assist Daniele Baselli ; The goal came against the run of play but was wonderfully worked by the home side. Juventus left far too much space available down the right wing, and Baselli did well to take advantage of it before teeing up Belotti."
16',goal,"Goal Andrea Belotti ; GOAL! Torino have taken the lead! Baselli flies down the right wing and beats Chiellini far too easily before whipping a great cross into the middle of the Juventus box. It finds Belotti, who comfortably out-muscles Lichtsteiner before nodding a lovely header into the bottom left-hand corner of the net."
15',action,"What a save by Hart! A bouncing cross from Sturaro misses Mandzukic but flies over to Khedira, who quickly shoots from the edge of the Torino box. His strike looks to be going wide before being poked towards goal by Mandzukic, but Hart gets down low to tip the ball away with a wonderful diving stop."
13',action,"Khedira loses out to Belotti in the middle of the pitch and the Torino striker immediately flies forward on a quick counter-attack. He links up well with Ljajic before shooting from just outside of the penalty area, but his thumping effort is well blocked by Chiellini."
12',action,"Fantastic opportunity for Mandzukic! The striker skips through the middle of Castan and Rossettini before latching on to a lovely cross from Cuadrado in front of goal, but he can't seem to decide whether to go with his foot or head and ends up sending a messy effort well wide of its intended target."
11',action,"Huge decision by the referee! Belotti gets the better of Rugani deep inside the Juventus half of the pitch before seemingly being dragged to the ground just outside of the penalty area, but the referee waves away the striker's protests and allows play to go on. A Torino free-kick surely would have been followed by a red card for the defender, who was the last man back."
9',action,"Sturaro and Sandro link up well on the left-hand side of the Torino penalty area before the latter tries to whip a low cross into the heart of the box, but Zappacosta stays tight to the Brazilian and is able to fire the ball out for a throw-in."
7',action,"Sturaro goes close! Once again, Mandzukic is left all alone over on the left wing and is able to fizz a dangerous pass across the face of goal, but it ends up flying just a yard or so past the outstretched foot of Sturaro at the far post."
6',action,"Sandro holds on to the ball for slightly too long over on the left wing and invites Falque to try and steal it from under his nose, but the Spaniard is slightly overzealous as he battles with the Brazilian and ends up giving away a free-kick."
4',action,"There's a huge gap deep down the right flank, and it's easily taken advantage of by Mandzukic. The Croatian picks up the ball in space and cuts inside quickly before trying to tee up Higuain, but Barreca darts back well to deal with the danger on the byline."
2',action,"Torino move the ball around nicely deep inside the Juventus half of the pitch before Valdifiori tries to test Buffon from 25 yards out, but there's slightly too much power behind the midfielder's strike and it ends up sailing comfortably over the top of the crossbar."
1',action,"And we're off! Torino get us underway, attacking from left to right."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."

,action,"Juventus substitutes: Benatia, Pjanic, Hernanes, Lemina, Dybala, Asamoah, Neto, Audero, Evra."
,action,"Juventus XI (4-3-3): Buffon; Lichtsteiner, Rugani, Chiellini, Sandro; Khedira, Marchisio, Sturaro; Cuadrado, Higuain, Mandzukic."

,action,"Torino XI (4-3-3): Hart; Zappacosta, Rossettini, Castan, Barreca; Benassi, Valdifiori, Baselli; Falque, Belotti, Ljajic."
,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"Juventus have, unsurprisingly, dominated this fixture in recent years, with Torino managing to win just one of the previous 23 meetings between the two sides. However, the Granata have looked dangerous under Sinisa Mihajlovic this season, resulting in them boasting the ninth-best attack in Europe with 31 goals. Adam Ljajic, Andrea Belotti and Iago Falque all find themselves in brilliant form, with 22 league goals between them."
,action,"As for Juventus, their search for a sixth consecutive league title is going well, but not as smoothly as many fans would have hoped. The Bianconeri have looked slightly off the pace in recent weeks, resulting in them already losing three times this season - only two shy of their total for the entirety of the previous campaign. As a result, this afternoon’s clash could prove to be a tricky one."
,action,"They did suffer a disappointing 2-0 defeat away to Sampdoria last time out, but they nonetheless sit in a very respectable seventh place in the table, with just six points separating them and fourth-place Lazio at the start of the day. An impressive start to the season has seen them lose just twice in their last 12 Serie A games, with Inter being the only other side to get the better of them during that period."
,action,"Last weekend’s 3-1 win at home to in-form Atalanta means that Juventus remain four points clear the top of the table, but they’ve looked vulnerable so far this season and, as a result, their cross-city rivals will be licking their lips at the thought of today’s clash. Torino are in good form themselves and could cause an upset today if they pull off another impressive performance."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Serie A game between Torino and Juventus at the Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino.
