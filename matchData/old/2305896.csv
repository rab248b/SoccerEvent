,action,"It was a nervy and frustrating afternoon, but Milan have managed to pick up a much-needed victory thanks to a late, late goal scored by in-form Lapadula. The striker was given little chance of scoring as a result of disappointing service into the penalty area, but he popped up when it mattered the most to help his side steal a victory that moves them up to second place in the table ahead of today's Derby della Capitale."
,action,FULL-TIME: MILAN 2-1 CROTONE
90'+4',action,"Adriano battles his way down the right flank as he tries to hold on to the ball and run down the clock, and he eventually forces three Crotone players into all pushing him to the ground. That should be that for the home side, who have just about done enough to leave with a win."
90'+2',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Juraj Kucka ; Kucka commits a clumsy challenge as he battles for the ball in the middle of the pitch, and the yellow card received by the midfielder means that he'll be suspended for Milan's upcoming game against Roma."

The home side win themselves a free-kick over on the left wing, and it's curled into a dangerous position in the heart of the penalty area. It can only find Trotta, but the striker's attempted clearance is poor and pokes the ball straight to Lapadula, who takes a quick touch before beating Cordaz with a thumping low shot."
85',action,"Abate picks up the ball on the right-hand side of the Crotone box before lifting a chipped cross over to the far post. Lapadula does well to meet the ball before nodding it over to Honda, but the latter is unable to get it under control and heads it away from Cordaz."
84',action,"Honda cuts inside from the left flank and bursts towards the Crotone penalty area before trying to tee up Adriano, who had made a good run into the box, but the Japan international is quickly closed down by green shirts and fails to find the striker."
83',action,"Honda and Pasalic muscle their way down the left wing before the latter pokes a pass up to De Sciglio, but the full-back isn't quick enough in trying to reach the ball and loses out before gifting a throw-in to Crotone deep inside the visitors' half of the pitch."
81',action,"Rosi is left completely alone over on the right wing, allowing him to calmly push forward. He plays a quick one-two with Rohden before swinging a deep cross into the Milan box and on to the head of Falcinelli, but the striker fails to hit the target with his towering header."
80',substitution,; Boos ring around the stadium as Niang is replaced by Honda in Milan's second change of the afternoon.

69',action,"Crotone almost go back in front! The visitors hit Milan on yet another determined counter-attack before Trotta unleashes a thumping strike from 20 yards out, but Donnarumma gets down well to stop it from finding the back of the net. He can only parry the shot into the path of Rohden, however, but the Swedish midfielder is beaten to the ball by Romagnoli at the vital moment."
68',action,"Crotone are unable to fully clear the danger, allowing Milan to break forward once again. Paletta darts down the right wing and cuts inside before poking a pass back towards Lapadula, but it's sent slightly behind the striker and is just about dealt with by the visitors."

The referee takes his time making a decision, but eventually points to the spot."

48',action,"How did Lapdula not score? A dangerous cross from Sosa flies to the far post, where it finds Abate at the far post.

,action,"It's been a tough opening 45 minutes for Milan, who haven't been at their best and, as a result, head into the half-time break with the scoreline level. Crotone have defended resolutely and largely did well to frustrate Niang and Lapadula, but they fell asleep when it mattered the most and allowed Pasalic to nod the home side back into the game. They've looked bright on the break though and will feel that, so far, their strategy has worked well."
,action,HALF-TIME: MILAN 1-1 CROTONE
45',action,"Niang bursts into the right-hand side of the Crotone penalty area as he attempts to latch on to a lofted pass forward from Suso, but the Frenchman's run is slightly mistimed and the linesman's flag is raised as soon as he makes contact with the ball at the near post."

43',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Aleandro Rosi ; Lapadula picks up the ball just outside of the Crotone penalty area and is immediately brought crashing to the ground by a hefty sliding challenge from Rosi, who becomes the first player to receive a yellow card as a result. The free-kick is in a good position and could cause more problems for the visitors' defence if the cross into the box is a good one."
42',action,"Milan quickly win the ball back from the restart and immediately try to hit Crotone on another determined attack, but Sosa's strike from 25 yards out fails to trouble Cordaz and flies several yards wide of the far post."
41',goal,"Goal Mario Pašalić ; GOAL! Milan have equalised! Niang almost fires the home side back into the game after catching out Ceccherini, but the defender recovers well to send the ball out for a corner.

38',action,"Lapadula wrestles with Ferrari in the middle of the pitch as he tries to carve out a chance on goal for Milan, but he's slightly too heavy-handed in his dealing with the centre-back and gives away a free-kick as he charges towards the visitors' penalty area."

It's chipped into the penalty area and towards Trotta, but Donnarumma is there to comfortably deal with the danger."
34',action,"De Sciglio cuts inside from the right wing before swinging a cross over to Pasalic at the far post, but Martella does well to dive in front of the midfielder before sending the ball out for a corner that quickly results in another for the home side."
32',action,"Abate loses the ball cheaply midway inside the Crotone half of the pitch, but he does well to steal it back quickly before bursting forward. He sprints into the right-hand side of the penalty area before trying to cut a pass back to Lapadula, but it's sent too near to Cordaz and is easily dealt with by the goalkeeper at the near post."
30',action,"It's all Milan at the moment as they desperate try to find an equaliser, but, once again, a dangerous, curling cross from the right wing fails to find a red and black shirt in the heart of the Crotone box and is just about dealt with by a volleyed clearance from Rosi."
28',action,"What a chance for De Sciglio! Milan immediately push forward through Abate from the restart, and the right-back does well to pick out De Sciglio in the middle of the penalty area. The number two is in a great position in front of goal and really should test Cordaz with his close-range header, but, somehow, he ends up sending it looping well wide of its intended target."
26',goal,"Goal Diego Falcinelli ; GOAL! Crotone have taken a surprise lead! Milan are caught on the break, allowing Rohden to burst into penalty area almost completely unopposed. De Sciglio darts back to try and deal with the Swedish midfielder and ends up dragging him to the ground, but as he does, the Crotone man pokes the ball over to Falcinelli.

16',action,"A cross-field lofted pass from Paletta finds De Sciglio over on the left flank, but the full-back's first touch is poor and sends the ball out for a throw-in. Milan have started the better of the two sides but haven't looked quite as fluid in attack as they normally do."

,action,"Milan will be without Carlos Bacca and Giacomo Bonaventura, both of whom are injured, but will nonetheless be confident about their chances of keeping up with league leaders Juventus with another victory. Talented winger Suso is in great form at the moment, and the Spaniard heads into today’s game searching for his fifth goal in four clashes."
,action,"In stark contrast to their opponents, Crotone’s first season in the top flight is proving to be a tough affair. Last weekend’s draw at home to Sampdoria lifted them off the foot of the table and equal on points with fellow strugglers Palermo, but a record of only six points from 14 games means that they sit four points away from safety heading into what should be another difficult day for the Serie A newcomers."
,action,"It’s been a good first third of the season for Milan, who, bar a disappointing slip up against Genoa at the end of October, have built momentum over the past few weeks, scoring eight goals in the last three games to send them up to third place in the table, equal on points with Roma. Three of their last four clashes have ended in victories, with only rivals Inter managing to keep them at bay during that period."
