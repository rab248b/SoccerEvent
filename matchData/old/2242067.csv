,action,FULL-TIME: LIVERPOOL 2-2 BOURNEMOUTH
90'+4',action,"There goes the final whistle and it's honours even at Anfield, where Bournemouth have claimed a well-earned point and halted a run of four straight home victories for Liverpool, who drop points in their quest to close the gap on the top two in the Barclays Premier League."
90'+2',action,"GOOD SAVE! Liverpool apply the pressure and a deep ball is headed back across the area by Matip for Klavan, who powerfully nods it towards goal but Boruc is equal to it."
90'+1',yellow-card,Yellow Card Ryan Fraser ; Yellow card Ryan Fraser
90'+1',action,A huge roar of anticipation roars around Anfield as the fourth official raises his board to indicate that there will be four minutes of added time at the end of this game.
89',action,"CHANCE! Liverpool go straight back onto the attack and force a corner which is met by Matip. The Cameroonian's header goes towards the far post, where Origi is just unable to connect and direct it home."
87',assist,"Assist Harry Arter ; Arter's volley fell right to the feet of King, who did the rest."
87',goal,"Goal Joshua King ; BOURNEMOUTH ARE LEVEL!!! King may well have snatched a point for the Cherries! Liverpool clear Cook's long throw but only as far as Arter, whose volley falls right at the feet of King. And the Norwegian holds off Klavan before guiding the ball away from Mignolet and into the far corner of the net."
86',action,"DANGER! Smith and Fraser combine down the right before the latter sends a low cross into the box. It falls to King but he is surrounded by Liverpool defenders, who are able to snuff him out and clear the danger."
83',substitution,"; Pugh is the next player to make way for Bournemouth as he is replaced by Max Gradel, who has now seen all eight of his league appearances this season come from the bench."
82',action,"At the other end, Can shows good attacking instincts by taking on Daniels before whipping the ball into the box. However, Cook is in the right place to clear - the centre-half has made more clearances than any other player in the Premier League this season."
80',action,We are into the final 10 minutes and the visitors are slowly starting to sense an opportunity as Liverpool are becoming slightly sloppy on the ball. Can they extend their unbeaten run to five matches?
78',action,"There is a worry for Bournemouth as Fraser goes to ground. However, the 23-year-old, who recently received his first Scotland call-up, is back on his feet and eager to continue."
76',action,"Not only that, but the Cherries would avoid defeat at Anfield for the first time in their history if they could find the fourth goal here. Time is running out, though..."
73',action,Can Bournemouth launch a late surge for the equaliser at Anfield? Eddie Howe is urging his players on from the touchline and will be hoping they come up with the answer.
70',action,"Right on cue, Spurs have just equalised through Dele Alli! Nevertheless, Liverpool would still apply pressure on the North London club should they hang on for all three points here."
68',action,"We are into the final quarter of the game at Anfield, where Liverpool are on course for a fifth straight victory in front of their home fans. As things stand, the Reds would move level on points with Tottenham, who are currently losing to Swansea City."
66',action,"ATTACK IT! Daniels finds himself in acres of space down the left flank and he delivers an inviting ball into the box. However, neither of the Bournemouth strikers attack it and the chance comes to nothing."
65',substitution,"; Coutinho has now been substituted 16 times in the Premier League this season, as he is given a rest by Klopp and replaced by Joel Matip."
63',action,"Fraser turned the reverse fixture on its head upon his introduction in December. Bournemouth trailed 3-1 when he scored his first Premier League goal and set up the equaliser for Steve Cook, before Nathan Ake grabbed a dramatic winner in stoppage time."
61',substitution,"; Bournemouth make the first change of the day and Ibe's return to Anfield comes to an end, as he is replaced by Ryan Fraser."
59',assist,Assist Georginio Wijnaldum ; Wijnaldum makes amends for his earlier error with a wonderful cross for Origi to finish.
59',goal,"Goal Divock Okoth Origi ; LIVERPOOL HAVE TURNED IT AROUND!!! Origi heads them into the lead! Wijnaldum shows good footwork to get away from Wilshere before sitting up a wonderful cross to the far post, where an unmarked Origi buries the header for his sixth goal of the season."
57',action,"Liverpool continue to apply the pressure with Firmino laying the ball off for Wijnaldum to strike. However, the Dutch international is unable to keep his effort down and it sails harmlessly into the Kop."
55',action,The hosts are very much on top at the moment. They are camped inside Bournemouth's half and the visitors are unable to get out.
52',action,"Klopp was out on the touchline a couple of minutes before Liverpool emerged at the start of this second half. It appears that his words are still ringing in the players' ears, as they have been very purposeful since the resumption of play."
50',action,"In fact, it was a great save by Boruc, who somehow got a hand on the ball to tip it onto the crossbar. Clyne last scored against Aston Villa in February 2016, but was very unlucky not to end his drought there."
48',action,"OFF THE BAR! Clyne is whiskers away from putting Liverpool in front! The birthday boy, who turns 26 today, lets fly from just outside the box, but sees his rocket crash against the woodwork with Boruc beaten."
46',action,KICK-OFF! The referee blows the whistle and Bournemouth get the ball rolling once more.
,action,The teams are back out on the field and the second half is imminent.
,action,"We're all square at the break following an action-packed first half. Benik Afobe gave the visitors a surprise lead after pouncing on a poor backpass by Georginio Wijnaldum, but Philippe Coutinho came to the rescue with a neat equaliser five minutes before the break. It leaves things very finely poised ahead of the second half."
,action,HALF-TIME: LIVERPOOL 1-1 BOURNEMOUTH
45'+4',action,"Liverpool are awarded a free-kick after Klavan is fouled by Afobe but, much to their dismay, they are unable to take it, as Mr Mason blows for half-time."
45'+2',action,"Great defending from Smith, who gets to the ball ahead of Coutinho to prevent him from having a clear header on goal. The right-back has hurt himself in the process, though, and is receiving attention from the physio."
45',action,His board may not be working but the fourth official indicates that there will be two minutes of added time at the end of this first half.
42',action,It's official - no Brazilian player has scored more goals in the Premier League than Coutinho. He has the ability to find the tiniest pocket of space and showed why Bournemouth simply cannot afford to take their eyes off him for a second.
40',assist,Assist Roberto Firmino Barbosa de Oliveira ; Firmino did really well before providing the killer pass for his fellow countryman there.
40',goal,"Goal Philippe Coutinho Correia ; EQUALISER!!! Coutinho levels things up for Liverpool! Firmino does well to hold off a challenge just outside the area. He then shows great awareness to slide the ball through the gap in the Bournemouth defence for Coutinho to run onto, and the little magician sorts out his feet before calmly slotting past Boruc. Relief around Anfield - Liverpool 1 Bournemouth 1!"
38',action,The home fans are starting to get a little restless here with their side struggling to find the equaliser. Each of Liverpool's last six defeats in the Premier League have come against sides in the bottom half of the table and the Reds will be hoping to avoid that happening for a seventh time here.
36',action,Coutinho will become the joint-highest Brazilian scorer in the Premier League alongside Juninho should he find the net today. He has looked very threatening so far and Klopp will encourage him not to let his performance levels drop.
34',action,"NOT FAR AWAY! Liverpool are awarded a free-kick to the right of the penalty area. Coutinho tries his luck again and his effort only just goes the wrong side of the crossbar, although Boruc did have it covered."
32',action,"At the other end, Coutinho looks to test Boruc from range. However, once again, his effort is right down the throat of the Bournemouth keeper."
31',action,"GOOD TRY! King chases a long ball over the top of the Liverpool defence and gets his shot away, but is unable to hit the target from a tight angle. His last goals for Bournemouth came when he scored a hat-trick against West Ham on March 11 - becoming only the sixth Norwegian to achieve the feat in the Premier League."
30',action,"Having returned to the starting 11 for the first time in a month against Everton on Saturday, this is a good opportunity for Lucas to stake his claim for more chances in the middle of the park. Interestingly, the Brazilian has made the most tackles in five of the last six seasons in the Premier League."
28',yellow-card,Yellow Card Lucas Pezzini-Leiva ; Lucas receives the first yellow card of the game after a rash challenge in the middle of the park.
27',action,"Meanwhile, there is another slight break in play here as Smith goes to ground and appears in some distress. Replays show that Francis accidentally trod on his foot in the area and the right-back will be hoping he is alright to continue here."
25',action,"GOOD HIT! Liverpool go back on the attack and, after an initial cross is cleared, Wijnaldum lets fly from just outside the area. There is plenty of venom in his attempt but it is straight at Boruc."
24',action,"For all of their attacking credentials, there continues to be questions raised towards the Liverpool defence. Prior to today, the Reds had scored and conceded in 21 of their 30 matches this season - the highest ratio in the Premier League."
22',action,"WHAT A CHANCE! Once again, Liverpool look nervy at the back and Pugh as the ball drops to him at the far post. However, the winger can only fire wide of the target with just Mignolet to beat. The hosts must be counting their blessings after that one - what a let-off!"
21',action,"VITAL CLEARANCE! Afobe peels away from his marker to control Daniels' pinpoint ball into the box, but Milner gets there in the nick of time to put it behind for a corner."
19',action,"CHANCE! The Reds continue to press and, following another corner that is flicked on to the far post, an unmarked Origi is unable to direct the ball towards the target. His frustration is evident but that was a great opportunity to score against Bournemouth for the second game running."
18',action,"Liverpool look to find their way back into the contest and force a corner. However, Bournemouth remain stubborn and deal with the danger."
15',action,Bournemouth lead after a quarter of an hour at Anfield thanks to Afobe's goal. The former Wolves striker has continued the run of 12 different players finding the net in this fixture in the Premier League as a result.
13',action,Arter just makes sure that all his teeth are still there and is soon back on his feet. The midfielder will be eager for a positive response today after his spectacular penalty miss against Southampton at the weekend.
11',action,"GOOD TRY! Origi cleverly turns away from Arter before getting a shot away from outside the area. The Belgian's effort fizzes just wide of the post, but that was better from the hosts. There is a slight break in play now after the striker accidentally caught his opponent in the face..."
9',action,"It may be against the run of play but Bournemouth will not care in the slightest. The Cherries are seeking their first-ever win at Anfield and that is just the start they needed, as Afobe pounced on Wijnaldum's error for his fifth Premier League goal of the season."
7',goal,"Goal Benik Afobe ; BOURNEMOUTH LEAD!!! What a mistake from Wijnaldum! Under pressure from Arter, the Dutchman lays the ball back towards Mignolet. However, the situation is very well read by Afobe, who gets there ahead of the goalkeeper to poke home and give the visitors an unlikely lead!"
5',action,"Meanwhile, Mignolet takes an extra touch but just about recovers the situation with Afobe lurking, as he cleverly turns away from the Bournemouth striker. The Belgian was in control but he needs to just clear the danger in future."
4',action,"Those were good positive signs for Liverpool and that will have pleased Klopp, who has won four straight home matches for the first time during his tenure at Anfield. It is three years since the Reds last won five on the spin in front of the Kop."
2',action,"BRIGHT START! The front three combine inside the opening 60 seconds at Anfield before Firmino's fierce effort has to be tipped over by Boruc. Lucas flicks on Coutinho's resulting corner, but Lovren is just whiskers away from getting the vital touch at the far post."
1',action,KICK-OFF! Mr Mason blows his whistle and Liverpool get the match underway.
,action,"ONE MINUTE'S APPLAUSE! Before kick-off, Anfield holds a minute-long applause in memory of the 96 Hillsborough victims as we approach the 28th anniversary of the disaster."
,action,"HERE THEY COME! The teams are out on the pitch and kick-off is just moments away. Lee Mason is our referee today - Liverpool have lost the two matches he has officiated involving the Reds, while Bournemouth are unbeaten in their two most recent outings he has taken charge of."
,action,"BOURNEMOUTH SUBS: Allsop, Gradel, B. Smith, L. Cook, Fraser, Mousset, Cargill."
,action,"BOURNEMOUTH (4-4-1-1): Boruc; A. Smith, Francis (c), S. Cook, Daniels; Ibe, Arter, Wilshere, Pugh; King; Afobe."
,action,"Eddie Howe also makes a couple of alterations from Bournemouth's draw with Southampton at the weekend. Former Liverpool winger Jordon Ibe returns to face his former club as Ryan Fraser drops to the bench alongside another ex-Red in Brad Smith, while Jack Wilshere is back for his first start in over a month in place of the injured Andrew Surman. Artur Boruc makes his 100th appearance for the Cherries today, as well as his 150th in English football."
,action,"LIVERPOOL SUBS: Karius, Sturridge, Grujic, Moreno, Matip, Woodburn, Alexander-Arnold."
,action,"LIVERPOOL (4-3-3): Mignolet; Clyne, Lovren, Klavan, Milner (c); Can, Lucas, Wijnaldum; Origi, Firmino, Coutinho."
,action,"Jurgen Klopp makes two changes from the win over Everton as Liverpool aim to move level on points with second-placed Tottenham Hotspur. Sadio Mane's injury in the Merseyside derby means that Divock Origi comes in for just his eighth league start this season, while Ragnar Klavan returns in the heart of defence as Joel Matip drops to the bench alongside Daniel Sturridge, who makes his return after a hip injury. Youngsters Ben Woodburn and Trent Alexander-Arnold will also be hoping for another opportunity to impress."
,action,"The reverse fixture in December produced a seven-goal thriller and neutrals will be hopeful of more of the same here. Both sides are protecting a good run of form coming into today's fixture. Liverpool have won each of their last four matches at Anfield, while Bournemouth are unbeaten in four in the English top-flight. However, one record will go here..."
,action,"Hello everyone and welcome to our LIVE text coverage of the Barclays Premier League! Today, we're at Anfield as high-flying Liverpool welcome a resurgent AFC Bournemouth. It's good to have your company!"
