,action,"That was an excellent performance from Pescara, who defended incredibly well to frustrate Milan and pick up a well-earned point. They were lucky to go in front thanks to a comical own-goal but did really well to limit the visitors' chances on goal from then onwards, with the Rossoneri looking off the pace and bereft of ideas inside the final third of the pitch. They final decided to increase the tempo of their attacks with 10 minutes left to play, but by that time it was too little, too late."

90'+5',action,"Deulofeu twists and turns over on the right-hand side of the Pescara penalty area before winning what will surely be the final corner of the game. The Spaniard steps up and curls a cross into the middle of the box, where it's headed out to Locatelli, and the midfielder then fires a speculative effort well wide of the goal."
90'+3',action,"What a stop by Campagnaro! A Milan corner looks set to result in a winning goal scored by Lapadula, but the former Pescara striker's shot is blocked just a few yards off the line by a brilliant, last-ditch interception from Campagnaro, who threw his body on the line to save his side."
90'+2',action,"Opportunity for Zampano! The full-back darts down the right wing on a great run before cutting into the Milan penalty area and skipping past Vangioni. He then tries to beat Donnarumma with a thumping shot from a tight angle, but it fails to test the goalkeeper and sails wide of the goal."
90'+1',action,"A wonderful lofted pass is fired into the right-hand side of the Pescara penalty area and finds Kucka completely alone on the edge of the box. He then tries to fire a first-time, volleyed cross over to Ocampos, but it's poorly hit and completely misses the Argentine."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be five minutes of added time.
89',action,"And now Benali almost scores! Bahebeck is left all alone deep down the left wing and is able to swing a cross right on to the head of Benali. The Libyan does really well to beat his marker in the air before testing Donnarumma, but his effort on goal ends up flying agonisingly wide of the far post."
88',action,"Two big chances for Milan! First, a curling strike from Deulofeu is well saved by Fiorillo at the near post before the ball pinballs over to Kucka, who then completely mistimes his strike and ends up firing it well wide of the goal. He really should have done better!"
86',action,"Romagnoli hits the post! The free-kick is initially well dealt with by the hosts before the ball bounces out to the right wing. A lovely cross is then fired back into the box and on to the head of Romagnoli, but the defender's downward effort smashes off the woodwork after leaving Fiorillo rooted to the spot."

82',action,"Bruno charges down the right wing and quickly tries to set up Bahebeck with a deep, looping cross over to the far post. There's far too much power behind it though, and, despite his best efforts, the Frenchman is unable to keep the ball in play."
80',action,"Big chance for Lapadula! Pasalic bursts into the left-hand side of the Pescara penalty area and immediately unleashes a shot that Fiorillo is just about able to tip away from goal. He can only push the ball out to Lapadula, however, but the striker's follow-up effort is well stopped by the legs of his former team-mate."
78',yellow-card,Yellow Card Manuel Locatelli ; Ouch! Locatelli dives into Campagnaro and sends the centre-back crashing to the ground with a hefty and late challenge that earns him a yellow card.

72',action,"Caprari causes problems deep down the left flank once again and does well to win a corner for Pescara. It's sent short to Memushaj, who then swings a dangerous low cross-cum-shot into the heart of the penalty area, but Lapadula is just about able to get a foot on it before it can cause any problems for Donnarumma."
70',substitution,"; Milan have made their second substitution of the afternoon, with Sosa making way for Manuel Locatelli."
68',action,"Coulibaly accidentally handles the ball whilst battling with Sosa and concedes a free-kick midway inside the hosts' half of the pitch. It's chipped into the box and towards the far post, but it's woefully hit and sails comfortably out for a goal-kick."

65',action,"Davide Calabria skips past his marker deep down the right flank before trying to pick out a team-mate with a low cross into the middle of the box, but, once again, Pescara deal with the danger really well before thumping the ball back up the pitch."

54',action,"Bacca weaves his way towards the Pescara penalty area on a purposeful run before sending a clever pass towards Pasalic. The Croatian only has Fiorillo to beat if he's able to find a way past Hugo Campagnaro, but he's unable to do so and the home side hold on."
52',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Cesare Bovo ; Benali tries to break forward on a quick run through the middle of the pitch, but he's closed down and dispossessed by Paletta, who seemed to foul the Libyan.

,action,"Pescara will feel hard done by as they head down the tunnel, but they should be proud of how they've performed so far.

Only on the break have they looked dangerous, and that proved to be the undoing of the hosts with only four minutes of the half remaining."

,action,"Milan slipped up slightly through what was a difficult January but have looked far better over their past seven games, helping to send them back towards the European places once again. Just two points currently separate the Rossoneri and Inter thanks to the 1-0 victory at home to Genoa before the international break, with Atalanta sitting between the two rivals in sixth place."
,action,"Atalanta were the latest side to pile more misery on Pescara, meaning that they have now conceded a whopping 66 goals this season. They only lost by a single goal in October‚Äôs meeting at San Siro, however, but Milan‚Äôs last visit to the Adriatico saw them comfortably win 4-0 towards the end what was another miserable campaign for their opponents."
,action,"With just 12 points and two wins (one of which was assigned to them on a technicality) from 29 games, Pescara remain rock bottom of Serie A and are as good as relegated. Despite enjoying a shock 5-0 win in Zdenek Zeman‚Äôs first game back in charge, the Abruzzo-based club are¬†in dreadful form, with all of their previous four league clashes ending in disappointing defeats."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today‚Äôs Serie A game between Pescara and Milan at the Stadio Adriatico.
