,action,"Full-time in Monte Carlo. Monaco go three points clear at the top of the Ligue 1 table after a comfortable 3-0 victory over Nice, with a Valerie Germain opener and a double from Radamel Falcao in the second period sealing the win. Over to you, PSG! Thanks for joining us, see you next time."
90'+2',action,"Nice's poor day at the office is summed up by Eysseric, who fires a strike off the post from relatively close range in what is a superb chance."
90',substitution,"; Three minutes of added time have been allocated. Meanwhile, Falcao is replaced by Kylian Mbappe-Lottin."
88',substitution,"; Another change from Jardim now and it is Bernardo Silva who comes off to a fanfare from the Stade Louis II faithful, with Nabil Dirar entering the action as his replacement."
86',action,Just under five minutes of normal time remaining and Nice have well and truly lost all of their battling mentality now. It will be interesting to see how Favre attempts to pick up his players after such a defeat as despite the loss they are still engulfed in the title race.
84',action,SAAAAAVE FROM SUBASIC! A sign of a great goalkeeper is their ability to burst into action even though they have not been tested at all previously in the game. The Croatian stopper does just this on this occasion as he gets down to his left to turn away a Plea header from 12 yards.
82',action,"Nice defeated Monaco 4-0 in the reverse fixture back in September, and by the looks of the proceedings so far the Monte Carlo outfit have had revenge on their minds during their performance tonight. They have outclassed their championship rivals by quite a distance."
80',assist,"Assist Thomas Lemar ; Lemar turns provider for Falcao this time, with the service again coming from the left."
80',goal,"Goal Radamel Falcao García Zárate ; GOOOOOOAAAAAAAALLL FOR MONACO! Game, set, match! Mendy is involved once again as he slides a reverse pass down the channel for the onrushing Lemar, who in turn picks out Falcao. The former Atletico Madrid man shows a superb bit of movement to lose his marker before squeezing a precision left-footed strike into the bottom right corner! Three-nil."
78',action,"Balotelli receives the ball inside the area but is unable to get the ball out of his feet in order to pull the trigger, which allows Jemerson to make the interception. Belhanda collects the loose ball and fires a strike at goal, but the Monaco right-back is there again to make the vital interception."
76',substitution,"; First change of the match from Jardim and it will see the opening goalscorer, Germain, make way for Joao Moutinho in what is a relatively pragmatc formation alteration from the Portuguese boss."
74',action,"Nice get the free-kick in a very useful position down the left wing around 30 yards out. Cyprien and Balotelli stand over it and it is eventually the Italian pulls rank to pull the trigger from the set-piece, but the resulting strike is slammed disappointingly into the wall."
72',action,"Eighteen minutes to go now and unless Nice can improve massively to catalyse an unlikely comeback, Monaco are going to go three points clear at the top of the Ligue 1 table. The visitors tonight will also be keeping an eye on the PSG match later tonight as Emery's charges can join them on 49 points if they can defeat Dijon."
70',action,"Nice almost score a goal of the highest quality as Belhanda and Plea exchange a duo of lovely one-twos on the edge of the box before the former eventually pulls the trigger. However, the volleyed attempt from the substitute goes high and wide over the bar, much to Favre's disappointment in the dugout."
68',action,"Nice's attacking players just haven't showed enough so far. They have the best defence in the league, but this afternoon you would be forgiven for thinking that Monaco hold this accolade as Gilk, Sidibe, and Subasic have barely put a foot wrong, whilst under little pressure though admittedly."
66',action,"It is great to see Falcao playing near to his best after two years in the wilderness with Manchester United and Chelsea. It was reported this January that the Colombian turned down a few lucrative offers to play in the Chinese Super League, and you can see why as he still has plenty to offer in Ligue 1. Only Cavani is ahead of him in the goalscoring stakes."
64',substitution,; First change of the match from Lucien Favre and it sees Younes Belhanda enter the action to replace Malang Sarr.
62',action,"Nice really need to sort themselves out here as Monaco currently look like they are going to score with each single venture forward. The visitors have defended well for the most part, but have been unable halt the outstanding runs of Mendy coming from left-back."
60',goal,Goal Radamel Falcao García Zárate ; GOOOOOAAAAAAAAALLLL FOR MONACO! Potentially a huge moment in the title race! Mendy is AGAIN involved positively for the Monte Carlo outfit as he breaks down the left on the overlap to receive a pass from Lemar following some great work by Bernardo Silva. The cross is drilled in and Falcao is there to send a predatory finish home from close range! Two-nil.
60',assist,Assist Benjamin Mendy ; What a performance from Mendy! Another absolutely perfect assist.
57',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Jemerson de Jesus Nascimento ; Balotelli has been fairly docile up until now, but comes close to losing the head a little as he is hacked down by Jemerson inside the Monaco half. In the end, the Italian settles for the guilty party being shown a yellow card for the tackle."
55',action,"Mendy is causing all kinds of problems for Nice on that left flank at the moment. He is showing a huge desire to get forward on the overlap and again sends a brilliant, volleyed cross into the box, but neither Falcao or Germain are quick on their feet to meet it with a header at the back post. Nice given a let-off."
53',action,"Bakayoko takes a heavy touch in a dangerous position in front of his own box which allows Dalbert to intercept. The Monaco man pulls and shoves away at the man who just dispossessed him, and is lucky not to concede the free-kick before Dalbert slips to lose the ball anyway."
51',action,"Eysserric moves through the middle with pace before passing down the left to Dalbert and then moving ahead looking for the return ball. In the end, the wing-back for Nice opts to cross into the box, but Gilk is positioned at the front post to send an awkward clearance behind for the corner-kick."
49',action,"One thing is for sure, Nice are going to have to show a little more attacking ambition if they are going to claim something out of this game. Even with their decent command over possession at times, they really have not posed a threat at all to Subasic!"
47',assist,Assist Benjamin Mendy ; A quite outstanding cross from Mendy for the assist!
47',goal,"Goal Valère Germain ; GOOOAAAAAALLLL FOR MONACO! The hosts open the lead! Mendy is slid down the left flank by a team-mate and somehow manages to dig out one of the crosses of the season for Germain, who makes no mistake with a bullet header past the despairing Cardinale! What a move! One-nil."
46',action,The second half is under way!
,action,Half-time in this top-of-the-table encounter. It is 0-0 between Monaco and Nice at the break as the league's best defence has successfully shut-out the league's best attack so far. Second period to come.
44',action,"Bernardo Silva picks up possession down the right-hand side and easily skips past the challenge of Dalbert before powering down into space towards the byline. Without much support in the final third, apart from Falcao, he is forced to settle for the corner-kick which catalyses an encouraging cheer from the Monaco fans."
42',action,"Just as Nice as put under quite a bit of pressure from Monaco's pressing, they are let off the hook as Fabinho comes in to completely take out Dalbert a few yards in from the right touchline. A free-kick to the visitors, which they are in no hurry to take this close to half-time."
40',action,"Five minutes to go in the first half as the opening period winds down without much incident. The Monaco fans aren't exactly known for creating a partisan atmosphere, but the traveling Nice support are trying their best to turn this into a bit of a spectacle."
38',action,"Nice have enjoyed the majority of possession, but Monaco have certainly edged this in terms of chances created. Cardinale has been called into action three or four times now, while Subasic in between the sticks for the hosts is yet to really see his gloves tested."
36',action,"Falcao picks up possession on the edge of the area with his back to goal and turns sharply before looking to gain a yard of space to pull the trigger. He eventually slides a neat pass to the right for Bernardo Silva who fires a right-footed strike towards the near corner, but Cardinale is solid in his goalkeeping and palms over the bar."
34',action,"JUST WIDE FROM EYSSERIC! The former Monaco man attempts to inflict damage against his previous employers with a bouncing attempted half-volley from the right channel, but the strike goes the wrong side of the post by a yard or two. Certainly an unlucky attempt, especially considering he was off-balance."
32',action,"Nice are controlling the game here, with Cyprien and Seri currently winning the midfield battle against Bakayoko Bernardo Silva. The Portuguese attacking midfielder in particular has not looked creative on the ball at all so far."
30',action,"The Monaco attack, which is usually so proficient going forward, has been decidely abject so far with Cardinale barely tested between the sticks. It is a testament to the Nice defence that they have managed to shut-out the most free-scoring team in all of Europe's top five leagues, but still time of course."
28',action,"Bakayoko ventures away from his central midfield position this time and looks to take the game to the Nice defence with a galloping run down the left channel. He keeps advancing but Seri is on-hand to get his body between the big midfielder and the ball, enabling him to win the cheap free-kick on the byline."
26',action,"We have seen very little of Germain, who actually scored 14 goals on loan at Nice last season, up until now. On this occasion he gets the ball in a very useful position around 25 yards out after a misplaced pass from the opposition defence, but his attempted lob over Cardinale barely gets a few feet off the floor."
24',action,"A small break in play at the moment as Souquet is currently down injured after taking a relatively innocuous in the middle of the centre circle. It looked to be after an altercation with Bakayoko, but the Nice man is requiring some attention from the physios before continuing."
22',action,"Something was always going to have to give this afternoon as we are watching the best attack in France, that of Monaco, versus the best defence in France, that of Nice. At the moment the defences are definitely on top but we are only just making our way towards the midway point of the first half."
20',action,"The visitors are enjoying the majority of the possession at the moment but it is all coming without too much penetration into the final third. Balotelli, who started the match promisingly, has just operated on the periphary of things a little in the past 10 minutes but can, of course, pop up with quality at any time."
18',action,"Nice actually manage to get the ball in the back of the Monaco goal as Plea breaks in behind before stabbing home. However, the celebrations are swiftly cut short as the linesman quickly raises his flag for a correct offside call."
16',action,"Following Nice's promising start, it is now Monaco who are beginning to find their feet going forward. This time, Mendy goes on a marauding run deep down the left wing before standing a cross to the back post for Falcao, but the Colombian is unable to divert a header on target despite getting the better of his marker."
14',action,"From the subsequent free-kick after the Seri foul, Lemar whips a superb delivery into the middle of the six-yard box. After a few dodgy moments from the Nice defence, it is eventually Cardinale who does very well to punch clear even whilst under plenty of pressure from Dante."
13',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Jean Michaël Seri ; First booking of the match goes to Seri, and deservedly so after a late tackle on the flank."
12',action,"Seri plays a blind ball back to the Nice defence and Falcao very nearly manages to intercept before going one-on-one with the goalkeeper. However, the Ivorian's blushes are spared by Dante who proactively comes out of his position to JUST win possession at the feet of the former Manchester Uninted and Chelsea striker."
10',action,Cardinale is called into action by Monaco for the first time now. It proves to be a relatively routine stop for the Nice goalkeeper though as Bernardo Silva sends a half-volley straight down the middle of the goal from 20 yards or so.
9',action,"It has been an impressive start to proceedings here from Nice as they look to take the game to Monaco in the early stages. The hosts side are trying their best to press high up the pitch, particularly through Bernardo Silva, but Lucien Favre's men are looking very much at home."
7',action,"On the opposite flank this time, Dalbert is the man to provide Nice with some width as he manages to get beyond his marker on the final third before sending in a deep cross. It is actually Souquet who gets on the end of it after darting in from the right wing, but the subsequent strike on goal goes wayward as the wing-back was well off-balance."
5',action,"Souquet is being awarded plenty of room down this right-hand side and on this occasion manages to hit the byline before firing a teasing cross into the centre of the box, but Gilk is positioned perfectly to make the vital interception before Plea can latch on for a strike on target."
3',action,"Balotelli is heavily involved in these early stages. Initially, the Italian takes the pressure off his defence with a commanding header from a corner-kick and then breaks free through the middle, eventually being scythed down by Gilk."
1',action,We are under way at the Stade Louis II!

,action,TEAM NEWS...
,action,"Leonardo Jardim last lead his team out to the pitch just three days ago in the Coupe de France. Competition minnows, Chambly, gave Monaco a big scare as they managed to take the game to extra-time, but it was the Ligue 1 outfit who managed to squeeze through with a 5-4 away result. Nice's last fixture came in the league last Sunday when they secured the 3-1 victory over Guingamp."
,action,"The last clash between Monaco and Nice took place in the middle of September. On that occasion at the Allianz Riviera, the home side stated their championship credentials with an impressive 4-0 win over the team from Monte Carlo, with goals from Paul Baysse, Alassane Plea, and a double from the rejuvenated Mario Balotelli sealing the three points."
,action,"At the beginning of the campaign in France's top-flight, very few would have speculated that the two sides featuring today would be at loggerheads in their attempts to be crowned champions, never mind both being positioned higher in the league table than the might of Paris Saint-Germain. However, Monaco and Nice are currently in joint first with 49 points taken from 22 matches – three points ahead of Unai Emery's outfit."
