,action,"That's all from the Parc des Princes. Thanks for joining us. Until next time, goodbye!"
,action,"It's difficult to know what to make of that. Nice are back on top, but they could have had so much more after going two up through Cyprien and Plea. PSG, meanwhile, should have won the game, given their chances, but Cavani's brace earns a potentially crucial point."
90'+4',action,FULL-TIME: PSG 2-2 Nice.
90'+2',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Younès Belhanda ; Belhanda has been playing on the edge throughout, and picks up a caution as he clatters Marquinhos."
90'+1',action,"SAVE! This goalkeeper! He has been awful and brilliant, in fairly equal measures. Kurzawa heads towards the far corner, it looks as though he's scored, and Cardinale somehow claws the ball away. Unbelievable."
90',substitution,; Remi Walter makes way for Vincent Koziello.
88',action,"CHANCE! Cavani may have been offside, but it's another spectacular miss from close range. Ben Arfa batters the ball low and hard across the area, and the Uruguayan turns it past the near post."
86',action,"More boos. Aurier crosses, Souquet just about clears. Ben Arfa takes up possession and wafts a woeful cross-cum-shot out for a throw-in."
85',action,It's getting really scrappy now. A number of bodies collide on the edge of the Nice box. The decision goes the visitors' way.
83',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Mario Barwuah Balotelli ; Balotelli holds the ball up, but concedes a throw-in. He disagrees, and explains this to the referee. He's booked. His explanation may have been a little aggressive."
82',substitution,"; Jeers for Di Maria, or jeers for Emery? Either way, the fans aren't happy and Meunier is on."
82',action,"Cyprien has posted a magical performance at times here, but he now wastes possession on the right with an overhit pass. At the other end, Ben Arfa does likewise."
80',action,"SAVE! A first thump from Balotelli. A long way out, it's easy pickings for Areola."
79',action,"Almost a chance for the hosts. Souquet gives the ball to Motta, but the pass that followed from the PSG man, looking to release Cavani, was nowhere close to his team-mate."
78',action,"The free-kick from that foul picks out Souquet, but his header loops up in the air for Areola to confidently take."
77',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Thiago Motta ; A blatant yellow for Motta, who completely upends Cyprien."
75',substitution,"; Alongside Nice's current number nine comes their former star. Ben Arfa, so brilliant in their colours last season, replaces Verratti."
75',substitution,; It's the change the Nice fans have been waiting for. Balotelli is on for the tiring Plea.
74',action,"OFFSIDE! Cavani thinks he has his hat-trick. Turning home from Matuidi's centre, the flag goes up. It's the right call, the crossing Frenchman was some distance beyond the last man as he took the ball."
73',action,"Vastly outnumbered, Nice, through Jean Michael Seri and Ricardo Pereira, are trying to pick the most delicate of passes in the final third. It's not coming off at present."
71',action,"Perhaps slightly tired from their immense efforts to rescue this game, PSG are slowing play again. Ultimately, Nice nip in and enjoy some possession of their own."
70',action,SAVE! Cardinale clings on again from Di Maria. This was a tame effort after the Argentine had combined with Cavani.
68',action,"Fine defending! Aurier delivers again, Cavani is there, sniffing, but Dante crunches in to knock the ball to safety."
66',action,"Aurier is enjoying himself. With so much space to run into, his speed is killing the Nice defence time and time again. Sarr recovers on this occasion."
65',action,SAVE! The Cardinale lucky dip comes up good this time. The goalkeeper saves from Di Maria's low shot.
64',action,"Plea fouls Verratti, but the Italian ""helped"" the official with a rather ludicrous dive. Plea, understandably, is not happy."
63',action,"Now they're back in the game, PSG need to avoid doing anything stupid. Boscagli makes progress on the left, but Marquinhos steps in. The defender's pass back to his goalkeeper, though, is a little too strong and almost causes a problem. Nice are pushing again."
62',action,"CHANCE! Cavani could, maybe should, have had his hat-trick. Another corner, another poor Di Maria delivery, but Plea doesn't deal with it. The ball pops up for Cavani to strike a volley at goal, but he drags it wide of the near post from close range."
60',goal,"Goal Edinson Roberto Cavani Gómez ; GOAL! We're all square! Oh, this is hideous goalkeeping. Cardinale has had this in his locker throughout the opening hour of this game, and his pathetic attempt at a punch deflects off Dante into Cavani's path. The Uruguayan toes home. 2-2."
59',action,"Aurier is always on the move! Verratti's gorgeous pass just carries up off the turf away from his team-mate, but Sarr, once again, was left for dead."
57',action,"CHANCE! All of a sudden, Nice are back on the attack! It's Cyprien again with the shot, from Ricardo Pereira's square ball, but he this time lacks composure and blazes over from in the area."
56',action,"Nice have to ride this out. PSG are probing continuously, waiting for a mistake. At the moment, the errors are arriving thick and fast."
55',action,"SAVE! Belhanda gives up the ball cheaply, and so does his best to tug Matuidi back. The French international shrugs off the Nice man's attentions, but shoots straight at Cardinale. Matuidi wants the play pulled back, but it was he who chose to play on."
53',action,"The visitors' energy has dropped a little. There are fewer options on the ball, and that's showing. PSG are swarming the man in possession every time."
52',action,"Nice need to slow the game down, keep possession. They do, the ball's at the feet of the reliable Dante... And he needlessly passes possession back to the PSG defence. Here come the hosts!"
50',action,"It's all getting a little heated in the middle here. Belhanda's not happy, neither's Matuidi. The two lean into one another, and the referee sensibly breaks things up."
49',substitution,; Dalbert cannot continue. Olivier Boscagli is on in his place.
49',action,"After the substitution, the corner finally comes in for Matuidi to head. He climbs well, but it's nowhere near the target."
48',action,SAVE! Nice are rocking! Cardinale stands firm as Kurzawa rattles a low drive towards the near post from a tight angle.
46',assist,"Assist Serge Aurier ; Aurier, a threat in the opening 45, delivered for Cavani."
46',goal,"Goal Edinson Roberto Cavani Gómez ; GOAL! Game on! PSG needed an early goal in this second half - this could hardly have come any earlier. Cavani missed a couple of good opportunities in the first half, but he could not possibly fail to score as he connected with the ball from a yard out. 1-2."
46',substitution,"; Krychowiak, who was almost entirely anonymous in the first half, makes way for Lucas Moura."
46',action,KICK-OFF: Nice get us started again...
,action,"The players are making their way back out in Paris. PSG are first to emerge, followed by the visitors..."
,action,"Cyprien whipped an opener into the net from a set-piece, celebrating wildly with the travelling supporters, and Plea was running over to the same section of the crowd just seconds before the break. For all the hosts' faults, Nice have been brilliant."
,action,"If Unai Emery was under pressure heading into this game, what about now? They've dominated in one sense here, but Nice have mustered the game's three best efforts."
45'+4',action,HALF-TIME: PSG 0-2 Nice.
45'+3',assist,Assist Dalbert Henrique Chagas Estevão ; It was Dalbert who lofted the ball in between Thiago Silva and Marquinhos to Plea. That may well be the first time the visitors have breached the PSG box.
45'+3',goal,"Goal Alassane Plea ; GOAL! PSG are all over the place! Plea's movement to take a high ball in the area is sublime, he controls on his chest, with Thiago Silva and Marquinhos slow to react. Then, faced with Areola, the Nice man sells both defenders and the goalkeeper with his finish. Brilliant, terrible. 0-2."
45'+2',action,"CLOSE! PSG cannot let Cyprien have the ball in shooting range. Belhanda and the recovered Dalbert prompt an attack, and Cyprien, after a couple of neat passes, skips into space and blasts inches past the post."
45',action,Kurzawa vs Ricardo Pereira is the key battle for PSG. Their man is winning it every time. His reward this time is a corner. Thiago Silva cannot direct a header on target.
42',action,"Another short stoppage after another ""robust"" PSG challenge. Yes, robust... Aurier crashes into Dalbert."
41',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Layvin Kurzawa ; Cyprien's been on the end of a couple of nasty tackles. Kurzawa is high - and booked. With the scoreline as it is, the goalscorer surely won't mind too much."
40',action,"SAVE! These are the chances top forwards have to put away! Cavani runs off the shoulder of Sarr, and he's in. His chest control is not great - the ball runs away from goal - and the Uruguayan swipes wildly at the finish. It bobbles up kindly for Cardinale to parry. Sarr is back to cover."
40',action,"When PSG do have the ball, they're taking it in turns to attack. Verratti is the latest, but his cute nutmeg comes to nothing as that man Dante steps in."
39',action,"The spirit in this Nice side is brilliant. Souquet plays a hopeless pass out of play, but Ricardo Pereira is there to encourage his team-mate. The visitors are keeping the ball relatively well, and pressing superbly."
37',action,"Cardinale's inconsistency is something to behold. He drops another cross, quite spectacularly, and requires a defender to mop up. Another corner comes to nothing."
36',action,"SAVE! Motta lets fly from a long way out, but the ball skips up off an advancing defender. Ultimately the ball loops up towards the top corner, Cardinale turns over."
35',action,"CHANCE! PSG are camped on the edge of the Nice box. Kurzawa, again, is the man to finally cross. It misses Dante at the near post, leaving Cavani all alone. The Uruguayan cannot adjust his feet, though, and prods wide."
33',action,"PSG are instantly back on the attack. Di Maria delivers from the right, and it's deflected behind. This time, though, the corner is easily dealt with."
32',goal,"Goal Wylan Cyprien ; GOAL! Nice lead! Unbelievable. Cyprien, who was struggling just moments ago, looks more than OK right now. With Ricardo Pereira fouled, Cyprien steps up to take the free-kick. He shapes a sumptuous drive up and over the wall, around Alphonse Areola, and into the net. 0-1."
30',action,"Plea is all alone leading the line for the visitors. He's doing a good job so far, though, holding the ball up, winning throw-ins and generally offering relief from his under-siege team-mates."
30',action,"Kurzawa, the star of the show for the hosts so far, wins a free-kick on the left. Di Maria delivers, but finds the head of Souquet. In comes another cross, and it's put behind for a corner. Matuidi meets the set-piece, but his header is a long way off target."
27',action,"Cyprien is receiving treatment now. On second viewing, that challenge, committed by Motta, looked a little nasty."
26',action,"Nice look to have an opportunity as Ricardo Pereira beats Motta to the ball. Wylan Cyprien is there, too, but picks up a knock and leaves the ball behind for PSG to come forward. Kurzawa forces his way through, crosses and Cardinale's there again."
24',action,"CHANCE! Dalbert slides in on Aurier, but gives up a corner. Di Maria delivers and Thiago Silva meets it again. This time he's closer to the goal - any meaningful connection would cause a problem - but he bundles the ball wide."
22',action,"It's Di Maria's turn to run past Sarr. The Nice defender needs help. Fortunately, Cardinale intercepts the eventual cross."
21',action,"Aurier and Kurzawa linked up so well earlier. Not this time. Sarr's shoddy positioning let's the Ivorian in, but Dante blocks the initial delivery and Kurzawa hammers the loose ball up, up and away. That shot's still going."
19',action,"Belhanda isn't the only one frustrated by the officials. Kurzawa does brilliantly to win back possession by the corner flag, but he's adjudged to have fouled his man. That looked harsh."
18',action,"Belhanda sells Verratti a dummy on the touch-line, but also thrusts an arm into the Italian's face. Free-kick. The Nice man isn't happy; the referee has a word."
17',action,"Arnaud Souquet, a surprise selection, complete misjudges a header to allow Kurzawa in on the left. He whips a low centre across the goal, but Di Maria doesn't gamble and Nice can breathe again."
16',action,"Are PSG targeting Sarr? He certainly seems very rushed in possession, unlike his cool, calm team-mates. He needs to settle."
14',action,"Some lovely footwork from Belhanda carries a Nice attack forward, but PSG soon have enough bodies back to slow the momentum. This has been a high tempo start in Paris."
13',action,"Almost a chance for Cavani! Cardinale flies out to take Matuidi's cross, only he doesn't. The Nice goalkeeper drops the ball right in front of Cavani, but Sarr prods the ball to safety."
12',action,"Dante needs to be at his best in this one. So far, he has been. Another fine piece of positioning to snuff out Aurier's teasing cross."
11',yellow-card,Yellow Card Malang Sarr ; Sarr has looked rash to say the least in the opening stages. He flies through Di Maria and takes the booking.
10',action,"Both teams are pressing extremely high. That probably suits Nice. They may need to outnumber PSG to have any joy, and a counter-attack seems the best route."
9',action,Nice with a first crossing opportunity... Wow. We won't see a poorer delivery all night. Ricardo Pereira clears the crossbar by quite some distance.
8',action,"PSG's full-backs are causing the danger in this little spell of pressure. Aurier and Kurzawa are both pushed high up the pitch. Dante is a busy man, marshalling in the middle."
7',action,"DOUBLE SAVE! Aurier flies forward on the right, squares the pass and, although it escapes Thiago Motta, Kurzawa thumps at goal. Cardinale saves brilliantly and is up quickly to block Cavani's rebound. In comes the corner... Another save. Thiago Silva nods straight at the keeper."
6',action,"PSG are looking at those crosses from right to left, with Matuidi and Cavani running across the ball. Verratti is the latest to have a go; Cardinale again mops up."
5',action,"Yoan Cardinale with a really poor pass, giving up a throw-in on Nice's left. They need those at the back to show more composure than that if they are to get a result here."
4',action,"Nice are still just finding their feet in attack. A couple of nice passing moves have been harried into submission, with Younes Belhanda the latest man to cede possession as Alassane Plea makes a forward run."
3',action,"Now, after Kurzawa steals the ball, PSG attack on the left. Blaise Matuidi appeared to pulled back, but the hosts quickly recover the ball. Switched to the right, Di Maria's centre is too strong for Cavani."
1',action,"An early slice by Malang Sarr allows Angel di Maria to run the ball down towards the corner flag. He forces a couple of throw-ins, but, when the cross finally arrives, Dante sweeps clear."
1',action,KICK-OFF: Edinson Cavani gets us under way!
,action,Here we go. Former Brazil team-mates Thiago Silva and Dante greet one another at the halfway line. Kick-off is now just moments away. This should be a cracker!
,action,The players are in the tunnel. They will shortly be making their way out onto the pitch here at the Parc des Princes...
,action,"Nice's last game, meanwhile, was a 2-1 victory in a Europa League clash with Krasnodar that had nothing riding on it for the French side. Unsurprisingly, Lucien Favre makes 10 changes. Mario Balotelli settles for a place on the bench."
,action,"So there are four changes to the PSG side that so disappointingly slumped to a 2-2 Champions League draw against Ludogorets in midweek. Out go Thomas Meunier, Maxwell, Hatem Ben Arfa and Lucas Moura - all of whom drop to the bench - while Unai Emery brings in Serge Aurier, Layvin Kurzawa, Grzegorz Krychowiak and Marco Verratti."
,action,"Subs: Benitez, Boscagli, Bodmer, Koziello, Marcel, Donis, Balotelli."
,action,"Nice: Cardinale; Souquet, Dante, Sarr; Ricardo Pereira, Seri, Cyprien, Walter, Dalbert; Belhanda; Plea."
,action,"Subs: Trapp, Meunier, Maxwell, Augustin, Ben Arfa, Lucas Moura, Jese."
,action,"PSG: Areola; Aurier, Marquinhos, Thiago Silva, Kurzawa; Verratti, Motta, Krychowiak; Di Maria, Cavani, Matuidi."
,action,"After Monaco's win yesterday, Nice are second in the table - behind only on goal difference - while PSG lie four points further back in third. The visitors could go top with a draw; they could put clear daylight between themselves and the favourites with a win."
,action,"It's the champions against the contenders, the underachievers hosting the surprise package. This game could shape the rest of the season."
