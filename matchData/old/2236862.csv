,action,It's Monaco next up for Unai Emery's men in a crucial clash between the two sides pressing to emerge as the main contenders to league leading Nice. Thanks for being with us tonight.
,action,"After a nervy opening 20 minutes, PSG dictated the game from the moment Cavani swept home a flowing move. Nantes rarely threatened after the break, and Cavani's 20th of the season came via a delightful free-kick to secure three points for the champions."
,action,FULL TIME: The whistle blows and Edinson Cavani's double leads PSG to a deserved 2-0 win at Nantes.
90'+2',action,"Ben Arfa and di Maria race forward on the counter yet again, but the Argentinian's strike is blocked by the only Nantes defender back to cover. That should be the last chance of the game..."
90',action,We'll have three minutes of added time as PSG look to seal a clean sheet and a comfortable win.
90',action,"CLOSE!!!! Ben Arfa strikes fiercely from the edge of the area, and Dupe does excellently to tip the ball onto the crossbar."
88',action,"Dubois crosses into a packed penalty area, but Trapp races off his line to deliver a commanding punch to safety."
87',action,"The clock is ticking down on Nantes' chances of finding a way back into the game, but in truth that hasn't looked likely since Cavani extended PSG's lead."
86',action,"CLOSE! Substitute Rabiot should have given PSG a third after the Ligue 1 champions countered, taking advantage of Nantes pushing bodies up into attack. Di Maria eventually finds Rabiot in acres of space on the right side of the penalty area, but his effort on his weaker right foot is easily saved by Dupe's legs."
84',action,"A half-cleared PSG cross is diverted back into the penalty area, where Thiago Silva is teed up in space just to the left of the six-yard box, but he is not on the same page as Lucas and his squared pass can't find a teammate."
83',substitution,; Cavani is withdrawn for Hatem Ben Arfa
82',action,"A lovely pass from Cavani finds di Maria, but his fierce low drive cannot find a way past Dupe. It's the last action for Cavani, who is about to be withdrawn to an earned ovation from the PSG faithful for his vital contribution."
80',action,"Cavani evades his marker as he tries to meet a Maxwell cross from the left, but he just gets under it and he can't find his hattrick. The resultant corner is punched out by Dube."
80',action,"As the game enters the final ten minutes, Nantes continue to gamely press for a way back into the contest, but they look sapped of energy and it's tough to see where a goal might come from."
78',action,"Lucas and Matuidi combine nicely, and Matuidi should probably do better as he tries to skip into the penalty area, only to see the ball pinched off his toe."
76',action,"Thomasson makes an immediate impact for Nantes, reaching the byline just inside the area on the left side, and almost squaring to the waiting Sala, but Marquinhos' quick thinking sees him clear the ball before the big Nantes forward can pounce."
76',substitution,"; Verratti, who could have received his marching orders in the first half, is replaced by Adrien Rabiot."
74',substitution,; Amine Harit is replaced by Adrien Thomasson for Nantes.
73',action,"Though they started the second half brightly, Nantes haven't really been able to replicate the intensity of their opening 20 minutes, and have yet to give Trapp anything significant to do since the break. The tempo of their play has dropped since Cavani's second, and at the moment it looks like PSG should see this out."
70',action,"Substitute di Maria sees a free-kick cleared, before picking up the rebound and firing a low shot towards goal which is smothered by Dupe."
69',yellow-card,Yellow Card Edgar Felipe Pardo Castro ; Pardo is booked for a clumsy tackle on Lucas.
69',substitution,; Angel di María replaces Draxler in PSG's first change.
68',action,"Cavani has only flickered in this game, but when he's been called upon he has responded with two expert finishes to give his side a comfortable advantage going into the final 20 minutes of the game. Can the hosts find any way back?"
67',substitution,; Yacine Bammou is replaced by Mariusz Stępiński for Nantes.
65',goal,"Goal Edinson Roberto Cavani Gómez ; GOOOOOOOOOOAL!!!! CAVANI MAKES IT 2-0 TO PSG! Nantes concede a free-kick, and this time Cavani takes set-piece duties ahead of Lucas Moura. A wise decision too, as the Uruguayan international steps up and coolly curls the ball over the wall and beyond a stricken Dupe for his 20th Ligue 1 goal of the season. Surely that wraps up the points for the French champions"
65',yellow-card,Yellow Card Diego Carlos Santos Silva ; Diego Carlos is cautioned.
63',action,"CLOSE! Lucas' free-kick finds Meunier at the near post, and the Belgian international's clever improvised header loops over Dupe and clips the top of the crossbar."
62',action,"Maxwell finds Matuidi's run, and the PSG midfielder is brought down by Djidji in a dangerous crossing position, just to the left of Nantes' penalty area."
61',action,"Lima reaches the byline, but his cross is cleared by Silva."
59',action,"Verratti is in the thick of it again, but not in a pleasant way this time. A clearance by teammate Thiago Motta cannons into the Italian midfielder's head, and he goes down clutching his ear, but he'll be fit to play on."
58',action,"Verratti gathers in midfield and powers towards goal, exchanges passes with Lucas before finding Matuidi, only for his left foot shot to be charged down. Bizarre booking aside, it has been a terrific performance from Verratti."
57',action,"Matuidi and Verratti combine to feed Cavani, who cuts in on his right foot and powers a shot on goal, only to be blocked by Carlos. Cavani wants a penalty for handball, but it appeared to deflect onto his arm via his head, so nothing is given."
56',action,"Motta totally misjudges a long ball forward, allowing Bammou space to run with the ball. He finds strike partner Sala, who tries to return the favour, but his pass is misplaced and it runs through to Trapp."
55',action,Frustration for Nantes skipper Gillet as he passes straight into touch when an easy ball was on to Dubois.
54',action,"Pardo, who has looked extremely lively since his introduction, skips past Maxwell, who does well to deflect his cross into the arms of Trapp."
51',action,"CLOSE! Substitute Pardo combines delightfully with Bammou, who finds the new arrival with a cheeky flick, only for his drive on goal to be deflected wide. Nantes have started this half as brightly as the first."
50',action,"Nantes enjoy a lengthy spell of possession, but PSG look resolute and Meunier eventually breaks up play only to be felled by Lima."
47',action,"Lucas tries to drive the ball under the jumping ball, but his effort is weak and blocked by the mass of Nantes bodies."
47',action,"At the other end, Verratti is tripped and PSG have a dangerous free-kick 25 yards from goal."
46',action,"CLOSE! Nantes start well, and could have equalised if Sala could respond more sharply to a cross across the box, but the ball deflects off his thigh and into a PSG defender."
46',substitution,; Jules Iloki is replaced by Felipe Pardo at the break.
45',action,The second half is underway...
,action,"The players are beginning to emerge from the tunnel, and the second period will soon be underway."
,action,We'll return in around 15 minutes for the second half.
,action,"A huge talking point will be the referee's decision to first book Marco Verratti in peculiar circumstances as he got down onto the ground to tap the ball back to his goalkeeeper with his head, and then not to give him a second yellow for a challenge on Rongier."
,action,"PSG were unsettled by a confident Nantes side in the early stages, particularly when Meunier fluffed a clearance and Sala wasted an opportunity to score. They were made to pay ten minutes later when Cavani completed a flowing PSG move, and from then on the Ligue 1 champions settled into the game."
,action,"The half-time whistle blows, and PSG lead 1-0 at the interval."
45',action,"Dazzling footwork from Moura sees him spring clear of three Nantes players, but Verratti can't find Cavani in the area."
45',action,"One minute added time, and PSG have a throw-in deep into Nantes territory as they attempt to protect their single goal advantage to the interval."
44',action,"Can Nantes create an opportunity before half-time? They dominated the early stages, before being shellshocked by Cavani's opener, and haven't troubled Trapp since."
43',action,"Maxwell gives away a corner with a poor attempt at chesting back to Trapp, but his blushes are spared when the PSG keeper meets the resultant cross with a strong punch clear."
41',action,"Marco Verratti should consider himself very lucky indeed. After picking up that bizarre booking earlier in the half, he goes into a challenge very strongly. The referee lets him off with a warning, but the Italian playmaker will need to make sure he stays out of trouble for the rest of this game."
39',action,"Draxler, who has shone intermittently in this first half, takes down a high cross expertly with his instep and finds Cavani, but his cross is swept to safety."
38',action,"It's a dangerous ball, but well dealt with by the PSG backline, eventually clearing to safety through Maxwell."
37',action,"Motta is penalised for a late trip on Sala, and Nantes have an opportunity to whip a free-kick into the box."
36',action,"A spell of PSG possession culminates in Matuidi heading an inswinging Lucas cross wide of the post. The France midfielder was forced to reach behind him to meet the cross, and it never looked likely to trouble Dupe."
33',action,"Nantes have picked the tempo back up since going behind. This time Harit haries past a couple of challenges before going down, but the referee waves play on, much to the annoyance of the home crowd."
31',action,"Harit takes the free-kick, which is deflected out for a corner. Lima takes, and there is pinball in the area, but somehow the ball is put behind for another corner. PSG having to see off some pressure from their hosts."
30',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Marco Verratti ; A very curious booking for Marco Verratti, as he appears to be cautioned for getting down onto his hands and knees and nodding the ball back to Kevin Trapp. The result is the home side having a free-kick in dangerous territory."
28',action,"PSG have a corner as Lucas Moura's corner is deflected into touch. He takes the set-piece, swinging a cross towards the imposing figure of Thiago Silva, but Nantes are able to clear."
26',action,"The game has entered a bit of a lull since Cavani's opener quietened the home support, and Nantes' energetic press has noticeably dropped off."
24',action,How Emiliano Sala must rue that early missed opportunity for Nantes. He's been taught a lesson in finishing by the nerveless Cavani.
21',assist,Assist Lucas Rodrigues Moura da Silva ; Lucas picks up the assist for his pin-point cross to Cavani.
21',goal,"Goal Edinson Roberto Cavani Gómez ; GOOOOOOOAL!!! PSG lead 1-0 through Edinson Cavani. It's against the run of play, but what a beautifully worked move that was to give PSG the opener. The impressive Draxler picks up the ball and sweeps it wide to Lucas Moura, who dazzles his full-back and squares for Cavani to smash the ball home first time from close range. It's cruel for Nantes, who have started brightly, but it's a fantastic goal from the visitors."
18',action,"Dupe comes off his line unconvincingly and misses a punch, but Thiago Silva can't get his head onto the cross. Matuidi picks the ball up from the resultant throw-in, but Nantes head clear."
17',action,"It's fair to say the Ligue 1 champions haven't hit their stride yet, and appear rattled by their hosts' effective pressing game. That said, a delightful turn from Draxler wins PSG a corner."
15',action,"A sloppy pass from Meunier, who hasn't had the best of starts, leads to a Nantes counter led by Iloki. He lays the ball off to Dubois, who reaches the byline and squares into the area, but Marquinhos is there first and PSG scramble clear."
14',action,"Nantes' high-energy pressing almost reaps dividends again, when Trapp is hassled into a rash clearance, which Iloki cannot quite bring down to sprint clear on goal."
10',action,"PSG win a free-kick, which is hooked into the box by Lucas. The rebound almost breaks to Matuidi, but strong defending denies the France midfielder a shooting chance."
8',action,"HUGE CHANCE FOR NANTES! Sala really should have given Nantes a lead. Meunier is caught dithering in possession as he tries desperately to avoid clearing the ball on his weaker left foot, and his eventual clearance is deflected into Sala's path, who has just Trapp to beat. However, he gets his angles wrong and slides the ball into the side netting. A huge let-off for Meunier and PSG."
6',action,"PSG manage to break the Nantes press through quick feet from Lucas Moura, and he feeds Verratti in the area, but he can't quite get his cross away."
4',action,"The hosts are harrying PSG players whenever in possession, and Gillet is unlucky to be penalised for a foul of Verratti as he tried to steal possession in the centre circle and start a counter."
3',action,"Nantes try to hit Bammou early with a raking ball from the back, but it's overhit and past the striker's outstretched leg."
2',action,"PSG almost get into trouble trying to play out of a tight spot near their own box, but Verratti is felled and they have a free-kick."
1',action,"Nantes start brightly, with Bammou engineering space on the left flank and sending over a hanging cross into the box, but PSG are able to clear."
1',action,PSG get us underway...
,action,"The players are emerging from the tunnel, and we're just minutes away from kick-off now."
,action,We're less than 15 minutes away from kick-off at La Beaujoire-Louis-Fonteneau. All the action will be with you shortly.
,action,"SUBS: Descamps, Kimpembe, Rabiot, Nkunku, Ben Arfa, di Maria, Lo Celso."
,action,"PSG (4-3-3): Trapp, Meunier, Silva (c), Marquinhos, Maxwell; Matuidi, Motta, Verratti; Draxler, Moura, Cavani."
,action,"PSG are without out several players, missing Alphonse Areola, Layvin Kurzawa, Grzegorz Krychowiak, Javier Pastore and Serge Aurier. Emery makes one change, with Maxwell replacing the injured Kurzawa."
,action,"SUBS: Braat, Vizcarrondo, Moimbe, Toure, Thomasson, Pardo, Stepinski."
,action,"Nantes (4-4-2): Dupe; Lima, Diego Carlos, Dubois, Djidji; Harit, Gillet, Iloki, Rongier; Sala, Bammou."
,action,"TEAM NEWS: Unsurprisingly, Nantes are unchanged from the side that beat Caen in their last game."
,action,"Julian Draxler's league debut goal in PSG's 1-0 victory at Rennes in their last game was a much needed tonic for Emery, who has endured a difficult start to life in Ligue 1. A 7-0 thrashing of Bastia in the Coupe de France showed what they are capable of, but defeats at Guingamp, Montpellier and Toulouse this season will still be fresh in their minds as they meet in-form Nantes."
,action,"Nantes have won all of their five games since Conceicao arrived in December, lifting them to 11th in the table, and haven't conceded in their last four league games. They have shown a real ability to grind out results too, with their last three victories by a single goal."
,action,"The French champions' away form has been patchy under Unai Emery, and this tie represents a huge test as they try to close the gap on league leaders Nice."
,action,"This has all the ingredients to be a fascinating encounter, with both sides unbeaten in 2017. PSG put four past Nantes both times they met last season, and comfortably won 2-0 at Parc des Princes in November, but the home side are a different proposition under new coach Sergio Conceicao."
,action,Hello and welcome to the live text commentary for today's Ligue 1 clash between Nantes and Paris Saint-Germain.
