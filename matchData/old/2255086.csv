,action,"That's all for today from Signal Iduna Park! Thank you for following our LIVE coverage of the German Bundesliga - hope you've enjoyed it. Until next time, see you soon!"
,action,"Lukasz Piszczek was the unlikely hero as he scored one and set up the other two, as Dortmund eased to a commanding victory over Wolfsburg at Signal Iduna Park. Jeffrey Bruma's own-goal from Piszczek's cross got the ball rolling for the hosts, before Ousmane Dembele headed home the third for Thomas Tuchel's men, who are now unbeaten in 31 Bundesliga matches in front of their own fans."
,action,FULL-TIME: BORUSSIA DORTMUND 3-0 WOLFSBURG
90'+2',action,The final whistle is blown and Dortmund have the three points!
90'+1',action,There will be a couple of additional minutes at the end of this match.
89',yellow-card,Yellow Card Jeffrey Bruma ; The Wolfsburg defender also goes into the book.
89',yellow-card,Yellow Card André Schürrle ; Schurrle has his name taken after being involved in a minor altercation with Bruma.
87',action,"FREE HEADER! An unmarked Merino almost makes an immediate impact from the bench, as he sneaks into the area to meet a Dortmund corner. However, he heads straight at Benaglio, who showed good reflexes to turn it away."
85',action,"The Brazilian is eventually back on his feet and we are into the final five minutes at Signal Iduna Park, where Dortmund are set for a fairly comfortable three points."
83',action,"Kagawa brilliantly creates some space to turn away from a challenge before running into the space. However, his through ball is well cut out and there is a slight break in play now, as Gustavo goes down injured."
81',substitution,; Dortmund's third and final change sees Weigl make way for Mikel Merino for the final nine minutes.
80',action,"JUST WIDE! Castro stands over the ball and whips it towards the near post, but his delivery goes just wide of the target."
79',action,It is looking like a matter of just how many goals Dortmund will score today. They are still pushing to increase their advantage and have just been awarded a free-kick on the edge of the area.
76',action,"NO GOAL! Aubameyang will have to wait for another opportunity to end his barren spell. The striker was initially denied by Benaglio before turning home Kagawa's header towards from goal from a yard out. However, he was way offside and his goal is rightly chalked off by the linesman."
75',substitution,"; Signal Iduna Park stands to give a magnificent reception to Jakub Błaszczykowski, who made 253 appearances in nine years with Dortmund. The Polish midfielder comes on in place of Vieirinha."
73',substitution,; Dembele is given a rousing reception as he goes off to be replaced by Shinji Kagawa.
72',action,"GOOD SAVE! Didavi gets in behind the defence before letting fly from a tight angle, and Burki is forced to get fingertips to the shot and turn it behind for a corner."
71',action,"Wolfsburg are trying their best to find a way back into this contest, but they just cannot find a way through the blanket of yellow shirts as of yet."
69',action,"Last weekend's defeat at Darmstadt was the 11th time that Dortmund have dropped points this season - more than they did throughout the entire 2015/16 campaign. However, this has been the perfect response from Tuchel's men."
67',substitution,"; Dortmund make their first change of the match, with Reus going off to be replaced by Christian Pulisic."
64',action,"Barring a miraculous turnaround from the visitors, Dortmund are set to extend their unbeaten run in the Bundesliga at Signal Iduna Park to 31 matches. Even without the iconic Yellow Wall, they have looked awesome so far here."
62',action,"It is now surely game, set and match Dortmund after that! The Black and Yellows really are devastating with the quality they have in attack and Wolfsburg have well and truly found that out today."
60',substitution,"; Gomez is given a rest by Ismael, as he goes off to be replaced by Paul-Georges Ntep."
59',assist,Assist Łukasz Piszczek ; Piszczek claims his second assist of the day with a brilliant cross.
59',goal,"Goal Ousmane Dembélé ; DEMBELE MAKES IT 3-0!!! The Frenchman arrives in the box to meet Piszczek's perfect cross, and power a header beyond the helpless Benaglio."
56',action,"Dembele has been a very inspirational player for Dortmund this season, having set up eight of their goals. He is joint-top of the assists list in the Bundesliga with Leipzig's Emil Forsberg."
53',yellow-card,Yellow Card Julian Weigl ; Weigl picks up a yellow card as he takes one for the team after breaking up a potentially dangerous Wolfsburg counter-attack.
51',action,"OFF THE POST! Whether he meant it or not, Dembele almost chipped Benaglio to make it 3-0. The Frenchman lifted the ball towards an unmarked Aubameyang at the near post, but saw his delivery clip off the upright and bounce away to safety."
48',assist,Assist Matthias Ginter ; Ginter helped Dembele's cross onto the head of Piszczek.
48',goal,Goal Łukasz Piszczek ; 2-0!!! Piszczek doubles the lead! Dortmund's free-kick is only half-cleared and put back into the box by Dembele. Ginter helps it on before an unmarked Piszczek heads beyond a scrambling Benaglio.
47',action,"Dortmund go straight onto the attack with Dembele leading the charge. He looks to slide the ball through to one of his teammates, but just underhits it and Wolfsburg are able to clear."
46',action,KICK-OFF! The referee blows his whistle and Dortmund get the ball rolling once again in this second half.
,action,The players are making their way back out onto the field and the second half is imminent.
,action,"Jeffrey Bruma's own-goal is the difference between the two sides at the break. The returning centre-half was very unfortunate to deflect Lukasz Piszczek's cross beyond his own goalkeeper and, after a fairly even opening 20 minutes, Borussia Dortmund have been very much on top since then."
,action,HALF-TIME: BORUSSIA DORTMUND 1-0 WOLFSBURG
45'+2',action,There goes the half-time whistle!
45'+1',action,"JUST WIDE! Malli is whiskers away from equalising for Wolfsburg! Vieirinha controls a long diagonal ball into the box before laying it off for the attacking midfielder, who steers his effort the wrong side of the post by a fraction."
44',action,"Dortmund's number 11 has a very impressive goalscoring record in this fixture, having netted nine times in his last nine appearances against Wolfsburg. Can he make it 10 out of 10 today?"
42',action,"Schurrle stands over the set-piece but cannot keep his effort on target. Meanwhile, Reus is moving around quite gingerly, but should be fine to continue."
41',action,"Reus is brought down by Arnold right on the edge of the area and stays on the ground, which will be a concern for Dortmund. Nevertheless, this is a very good position for the hosts..."
39',action,"There has been a lot more purpose to Wolfsburg's play over the past few minutes. Malli looks to set the ball rolling on this occasion, but just overhits his pass that was intended for Gomez."
37',action,"The visitors look to find a way back into the game and are awarded a free-kick on the right-hand side. However, the momentum is halted as Gomez starts his run too early and is ruled offside."
35',action,"ALMOST! Dortmund go close to doubling their lead following a sweeping move down the field. Dembele looks for Reus with a precise through ball, but the latter is unable to stretch far enough to connect and direct it past Benaglio."
34',substitution,"; Seguin makes way to be replaced by Daniel Didavi, who was the match winner against Hoffenheim last week."
31',action,"In fact, it looks like Seguin will not play any further part in this game as he goes down again with nobody around him. This is another early blow for Wolfsburg."
29',action,"There is a slight break in play here after Seguin goes down awkwardly following a challenge from Schurrle. The Wolfsburg midfielder is limping as he receives attention from the physio, but will look to carry on."
27',action,"SHOOT! A very clever through ball releases Reus, who brilliantly sprung the offside trap, but tried to take on one defender too many instead of getting his shot away and is eventually dispossessed."
25',action,Wolfsburg have now conceded in each of their last 16 matches against Dortmund in the Bundesliga - letting in a total of 41 goals along the way. You feel that that number will rise if the hosts continue to dominate proceedings.
23',action,"As expected, Dortmund are now very much on the front foot following that huge slice of good luck. The hosts will now be looking to build on that in their bid to get back to winning ways."
20',own-goal,"Own Goal Jeffrey Bruma ; OWN GOAL!!! Dortmund lead! What a catastrophe for Bruma who, on his return to the side from suspension, unwittingly deflects Piszczek's attempted cross beyond a flat-footed Benaglio! All of the visitors' good early work has been undone in the most unfortunate of circumstances."
17',action,"That was just the sort of opportunity that Aubameyang was looking for as he looks to put an end to his dry spell in front of goal. However, it was just a really good save from Benaglio to deny him on that occasion."
15',action,"CHANCE! Aubameyang gets his first clear sight on goal in the area and lets fly with his left foot, but Benaglio shows great reflexes to make a smart save."
13',action,"Wolfsburg have conceded five times in each of their two most recent meetings with Dortmund, but the visitors will be fairly pleased with the start they have made to this contest so far."
10',action,"VERY SMOOTH! Burki is put under pressure as Gomez looks to charge down his clearance, but the Dortmund keeper performs a cool little dummy which completely wrongfoots the striker before finding a simple pass."
8',action,Both sides have seen plenty of the ball in the early stages of this match. It all points towards a fairly close contest today between two teams at different ends of the Bundesliga table.
5',action,"However, the Wolves know that they face a much tougher prospect at Signal Iduna Park, where Dortmund were last beaten at Greek side PAOK in the UEFA Europa League in December 2015."
3',action,"Wolfsburg ended a run of three straight defeats in all competitions when they came from behind to beat Hoffenheim last weekend, and the visitors look very comfortable at the start of this match."
1',action,KICK-OFF! The referee blows his whistle and Wolfsburg get the match underway.
,action,"HERE THEY COME! The players are making their way out onto the field and kick-off is just moments away. Despite the iconic Yellow Wall being closed today following crowd trouble in Dortmund's most recent home match against RB Leipzig, Signal Iduna Park is still in fine voice."
,action,"WOLFSBURG SUBS: Ntep, Divadi, Blaszczykowski, Trasch, Mayoral, Casteels, Knoche."
,action,"WOLFSBURG (4-4-1-1): Benaglio; Vieirinha, Bruma, Rodriguez, Horn; Seguin, Arnold, Gustavo, Gerhardt; Malli; Gomez."
,action,"Meanwhile, there are no real surprises as Valerin Ismael makes just two changes to the Wolfsburg side that started that impressive win against Hoffenheim. Jeffrey Bruma returns from suspension in the heart of defence with Luiz Gustavo moving into midfield, while Jannes Horn comes in at right-back as Robin Knoche drops to the bench. Mario Gomez leads the charge up front, as former Dortmund favourite Jakub Blaszczykowski could make his first appearance against the club where he spent nine years before moving on at the end of last season."
,action,"DORTMUND SUBS: Weidenfeller, Guerreiro, Pulisic, Kagawa, Merino, Passlack, Durm."
,action,"DORTMUND (4-1-4-1): Burki; Piszczek, Ginter, Bartra, Schmelzer (c); Weigl; Schurrle, Castro, Dembele, Reus; Aubameyang."
,action,"Thomas Tuchel has made three changes to the Dortmund 11 that started their 1-0 defeat by Benfica in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League showdown in midweek. Andre Schurrle returns to face his former club, where he scored 10 goals in 43 appearances, while Gonzalo Castro also comes into midfield with Erik Durm and Raphael Guerreiro dropping to the bench. The other change sees Matthias Ginter replace Sokratis Papastathopoulos in the heart of defence. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang gets the nod up front despite finding the net just once in his last seven appearances, but Mario Gotze remains sidelined and underwent a groin operation today."
,action,"Dortmund are aiming to bounce back from their surprise defeat at bottom club Darmstadt last weekend, which saw them fall 15 points behind runaway leaders Bayern Munich, while Wolfsburg are carrying momentum following their morale-boosting 2-1 victory over Hoffenheim."
,action,"Hello everyone and welcome to LIVE text coverage of the 2016/17 German Bundesliga season! Today, we're at Signal Iduna Park as fourth-place Borussia Dortmund welcome struggling Wolfsburg. It's good to have your company!"
