,action,"Thanks for joining our commentary this afternoon. Until next time, goodbye."
,action,"Watford move above Everton in the Premier League into seventh place, which highlights just how tight the table is this season, with very little separating the sides in the lower half."
,action,"A brace from Stefano Okaka ends a run of back-to-back defeats for Watford to fire them to the three points this afternoon over Everton. Romelu Lukaku scored a twice for The Toffees, but it was not enough for them as they make it 1 win in 10 matches now in the Premier League to increase the pressure on Ronald Koeman."
,action,FULL-TIME: WATFORD 3-2 EVERTON

90'+4',action,"Everton work their way out of their own box and Lukaku collects a short pass from Valencia before sending the ball into the area, but the attack is halted for a handball against Coleman."

88',action,"CHANCE! Lukaku collects in the left inside channel and blasts the ball across the face of goal. Gomes cannot gather the ball and he fumbles it inside the six-yard box, but there's no blue shirt there to pounce on the loose ball."
86',assist,Assist Aaron Lennon ; Lennon produces an excellent cross to pick out Lukaku in the middle to bring the visitors back into the contest.
86',goal,Goal Romelu Lukaku Menama ; GOAL!!!! LUKAKU BRINGS EVERTON BACK TO LIFE! The Toffees are not out of this one just yet as Lukaku latches on to Lennon's pinpoint cross from the left flank and unmarked steers his header into the bottom corner. Game on!
85',action,"WIDE! Lennon cuts in from the flank and delivers a hanging cross to the back post for Valencia to attack. The striker makes contact with a decent attempt, but it fails to test Gomes, travelling wide of the post."
83',action,"CHANCE! Deulofeu sends a low cross towards the near post, but where Okaka succeeded in the first half, Lukaku fails as his backheeled effort goes wide of the post."
83',substitution,; Baines makes way for Lennon.
82',action,"Holebas makes a break in the final third and tries to get between Williams and Coleman, but goes down under little contact and the referee dismisses his claims for a penalty."
81',substitution,; Okaka makes away after an excellent display and is replaced by Watson to tighten things up at the back.
80',action,"SHOT! Valencia raids towards the edge of the box and opens up space to shoot on his right foot, but his effort lacks the curl needed to find the top corner, drifting just wide of the post."
78',action,"Deulofeu and Barkley combine in the final third, but as the England man shoots at goal two yellow shirts come across to divert his effort behind for a corner."
77',action,"Barkley's struggles are highlighted as the ball drops to him on the edge of the box from the resulting corner, but he completely scuffs his shot on his attempted strike, while his efforts to regain possession prove to be futile."
76',action,"Everton work the ball well into the Watford box as Deulofeu picks out Valencia in the left inside channel. However, the forward takes a poor touch and allows Prodl to clear it behind for a throw-in."
74',yellow-card,Yellow Card José Holebas ; Holebase goes into the book for time-wasting.
73',action,"Mazzarri is urging calm from his side to take the pace out of the game. They have been excellent for the majority of the contest, but they cannot afford to give Everton a sniff here."
71',substitution,; Mirallas makes way for Valencia for the visitors.
70',action,Everton are exposed at the back due to the numbers they are committing forward and only good clearing headers from Funes Mori and Coleman prevent Okaka breaking in behind their defensive line.
68',action,"The Toffees are pushing men forward here now and Coleman makes a another surge down the right, but the home side manage to clear his low cross into the box."
66',action,"Coleman sends a dangerous low cross towards the near post for Lukaku's run, but the striker is well marked by Prodl and his strike cannons off the defender and on to his legs to go out for a goal-kick."
64',substitution,; Barkley replaces Gueye for the visitors.
64',assist,Assist José Holebas ; Holebas produces another excellent set-piece and Okaka delivers his second goal of the game.

63',action,"CHANCE! Amrabat swings the ball into the box deep to the back post for Britos. The defender is unmarked and heads his effort into the ground, but Steklenburg just gets his fingertips on the ball to turn it behind."
62',yellow-card,Yellow Card Leighton Baines ; Baines wipes out Amrabat in his bid to clear a loose ball and heads into the book. Everton now have another set-piece to deal with.

59',assist,"Assist José Holebas ; Holebas produces an excellent cross from the left, which is converted expertly by Prodl to hand Watford the lead."
59',goal,Goal Sebastian Prödl ; GOAL!!! PRODL PUTS WATFORD AHEAD! The Austrian defender makes no mistake this time as he makes a good run towards the edge of the six-yard box and nods Holebas' pinpoint cross past a stranded Stekelenburg from close range.
58',action,"OVER! Amrabat sends the ball in from the right flank and Prodl rises highest in the box, but he can only power his header over the bar."
57',action,"Barry always seems to be walking a tight line on the disciplinary rope and he barges over Zuniga on the right flank, but the referee only awards a free-kick."

46',action,We're back underway at Vicarage Road.
,action,Behrami has an issue before we start the second half as it appears he has just been sick on the pitch. He looks ok to continue though.
,action,"The players are back out for the second half, so we should be underway shortly."
,action,"Walter Mazzarri will be pleased with his side's performance this afternoon bar their lapse of concentration for the goal, but they have been asking the visitors plenty of questions. In the other dugout Everton have been fairly toothless apart from the clinical edge displayed opening the scoring, which will concern Ronald Koeman."
,action,"It's all square at the break in the Premier League clash between Watford and Everton. Romelu Lukaku scored his first goal in five league matches to hand the Toffees an early lead, but the home side responded by dominating the final 20 minutes of the half and were rewarded when Stefano Okaka equalised."
,action,HALF-TIME: WATFORD 1-1 EVERTON
45'+2',action,The referee ends the first half at Vicarage Road.
45',action,There will be two minutes of added time.
44',action,"A miscommunication between Holebas and Gomes almost allows Deulofeu to pounce, but the Watford left-back just does enough to stop the winger's progress in the inside right channel."
42',action,"CHANCE! Deeney should put the home side ahead, but he fails to connect at the back post from Guedioura's delightful cross into the box. Coleman jumped ahead of him and just appeared to put the Watford skipper off, although it goes down as a chance spurned."

36',goal,Goal Stefano Okaka Chuka ; GOAL!!! OKAKA LEVELS FOR THE HORNETS! The equaliser has been coming and it arrives in style as Okaka makes a good run to the near post and converts Amrabat's fine low cross past Stekelenburg with a clever backheel flick. A sublime finish from the forward.
35',action,"CHANCE! Holebas throws the ball long into the box from the left and Deeney rises to flick it on into the middle of the area. Guedioura gets there first, but cannot generate enough power on his effort to beat Stekelenburg."
32',action,"Capoue is not impressed with the referee as he attempts to beat three Everton defenders on the edge of the box and goes down under pressure from Barry, but the referee Taylor waves play on."
31',action,"Watford have been decent enough in the middle of the park, but their lack of clinical edge has hurt them. They've only scored 34 goals in the Premier League in 2016 - the lowest of all the sides ever present in the division this year."
29',action,"Prodl has struggled with Lukaku' physical presence in the opening stages of the contest, but he does well on this occasion to steer Baines' cross away from the Belgian."

21',action,"Watford win a corner on the left thanks to Okaka's battling against Coleman. Guedioura swings the resulting cross towards the near post, but Britos can only head his effort wide of the post."
20',action,"SHOT! Okaka collects in space on the edge of the box and opens up his body to strike on his right foot. The ball edges past Funes Mori, but he fails to generate enough power on his effort to beat Stekelenburg."
18',action,"Everton are straight on the attack again as Lukaku nods the ball out wide to Deulofeu. The winger speeds down the flank before sending his cross to the near post, but on this occasion Gomes gathers without a problem."
17',assist,"Assist Gareth Barry ; Barry does brilliantly to catch the Watford defence by surprise with a first-time ball over the top, allowing Lukaku to collect and score."
17',goal,"Goal Romelu Lukaku Menama ; GOAL!!!! LUKAKU STRIKES FROM CLOSE RANGE! Everton take the lead out of nothing as Barry launches a simple ball over the top of the Watford defence, and Lukaku gets behind Prodl and Britos before slotting the ball between Gomes' legs. An easy goal for the visitors."
15',action,"Holebas lifts the resulting free-kick into the box, but Prodl can only guide his attempted overhead kick out for a goal-kick."
14',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Gerard Deulofeu Lázaro ; Deulofeu brings Zuniga down 40 yards from goal, presenting the home side with a free-kick."

11',action,"A long ball over the top almost has Okaka interested, but Funes Mori does not panic under pressure clearing the ball out for a throw-in."
9',action,"CHANCE! Gomes has to react at his near post to clear Deulofeu's low cross away from the net. The ball dipped just at the last second, forcing the Watford keeper to palm the ball to safety."
7',yellow-card,Yellow Card Adlène Guédioura ; Guedioura heads into the book for his tackle on Gueye.
7',action,"Gueye shows his quality in the middle of the park as he skips away from Behrami, but then gets brought down by a loose challenge from Guedioura. The midfield battle will be important for both teams this afternoon."
6',action,"Panic stations for the home side at the back as Deulofeu hits a dangerous cross into the box. The ball strikes Britos and almost falls for Mirallas in the six-yard area, but Prodl clears away before the Belgian can pounce."
5',action,"Holebas and Capoue continue to be in the action, with the latter finding the defender on the flank. However, the cross from Holebas goes straight out for a goal-kick."
3',action,"Capoue looks to find Holebas in the final third, but his pass out wide to the left-back has too much pace and goes straight out for a throw-in. The Frenchman has been an important player for the Hornets this season and they will need him to be at his best."
2',action,"Deulofeu attempts to surge past Capoue on the flank, but the Frenchman does well to use his strength to outmuscle the winger, while a foul by Coleman on Holebas allows the home side to clear the danger from a free-kick."
1',action,We're underway at Vicarage Road.
,action,"The players are making their way out on to the pitch, so we should be underway shortly."

,action,"STAT ATTACK: Everton are unbeaten in their last eight Premier League matches against Watford, winning six of the contests."
,action,"There's still no place in the Everton side for Ross Barkley who starts from the bench alongside skipper Phil Jagielka, with Ashley Williams and Ramiro Funes Mori preferred in the heart of the defence."
,action,"Koeman has made two changes from his side that drew with Manchester United. Yannick Bolasie has been ruled out for the rest of the season, leaving a void on the flank. Gerard Deulofeu replaces him this afternoon, while James McCarthy comes into the midfield for Tom Cleverley."
,action,"Watford are without the suspended Roberto Pererya this afternoon following his dismissal at West Brom last week. Valon Behrami replaces him in the line-up, while Miguel Britos comes into the back four, with Christian Kabasele dropping to the bench."

A late Leighton Baines strike from the penalty spot earned them a vital point against Manchester United, but Ronald Koeman's men need to get back to winning ways sooner rather than later."
,action,"Watford's decent start to the campaign has come to a halt in recent weeks, suffering three defeats in their last four matches. The Hornets have lost to Stoke and West Brom in back-to-back games to fall into the bottom half of the table and need a result today to stop their slide."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to the live commentary of the Premier League clash between Watford and Everton at Vicarage Road.
