,action,"Inter started the game slowly and took a while to get into it, but after the break they performed incredibly well and deservedly leave with a well-earned victory. They looked the more dangerous of the two sides throughout the second half and caused Genoa plenty of problems when pushing forward, whilst, at the back, they defended diligently to deny the visitors any clear-cut chances on goal."
,action,FULL-TIME: INTER 2-0 GENOA
90'+3',action,"Ninkovic gets himself into a good position just outside of the Inter penalty area on the left flank, but his cheeky chipped strike fails to catch out Handanovic and ends up sailing comfortably wide of the far post. That should be that for the home side."
90'+2',action,"Banega twists and turns just outside of the Genoa penalty area before finally managing to get a shot away, but his low effort doesn't have enough power behind it to beat Burdisso, who does well to throw his body in the way of the strike."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be three minutes of added time.
89',action,"Ninkovic is tripped over from behind by Candreva and wins his side a free-kick in a good position over on the left wing. It's swung into the middle of the Inter box and finds Munoz, but the defender's headed effort fails to hit the target."

86',action,"Genoa go close again! This time it's Pandev who breaks into the right-hand side of the Inter penalty area before fizzing a low pass across the face of goal, but it fails to meet any of the three white shirts in front of goal before being dealt with by D'Ambrosio."
85',substitution,"; Genoa have made their final alteration of the game, with Laxalt making way for Edenilson."
84',action,"Vital interception by Murillo! Ninkovic cuts inside from the left wing before swinging a lovely cross towards Pandev at the far post, but Murillo is just about able to get a head on the ball to send it away from the striker and out for a corner."

82',action,"Almost an opportunity for Candreva! Mario gets himself into a great position deep down the right flank before trying to tee up Candreva with a low cross, but just as the winger is about to pull the trigger, Munoz dives in front of him to deny him the chance to do so."

The Japan international meets the ball on the left-hand side of the box and cuts inside quickly before shooting, but his curling effort fails to find the top right-hand corner of the net."
79',substitution,"; Genoa have made a late change, with former Inter player Pandev coming on to take the place of Rigoni."
78',action,"Great save by Perin! The follow-up corner is fired into the heart of the box and finds Miranda, but the centre-back's towering header is tipped over the crossbar by Perin before it can sneak into the back of the net."
77',action,"A thumping low strike is fired from the set-piece, but it isn't hit well enough to trouble Perin and ends up deflecting out for a corner. It's sent towards the edge of the penalty area and finds Brozovic, but the Croatian's volleyed effort ends up being deflected out for another corner."
76',action,"Genoa are sloppy in the middle of the pitch and gift the ball to D'Ambrosio, who then flies forward on a good run before being clumsily fouled by Burdisso not too far outside of the visitors' penalty area. The free-kick is definitely in shooting distance, but can Inter make it count?"
74',action,"Laxalt and Simeone link up well on the edge of the Inter penalty area before the latter is able to get a rare shot away, but his strike doesn't have enough power behind it to trouble Handanovic in the middle of the goal."

67',action,"Almost a costly error by Perin! The goalkeeper receives the ball inside his own penalty area and takes far too long in possession, allowing Icardi to close him down quickly. The striker almost manages to steal it from under his nose, but Perin just about manages to stick away and clear the danger."
66',action,"Ninkovic goes close! Laxalt breaks into the Inter half of the pitch before being fouled, but the ball rolls over to Ninkovic. He picks it up and charges forward before shooting from 25 yards out, and his strike ends up curling just wide of the far post."
64',action,"Genoa leave far too much room available in the middle of the pitch, allowing Melo to break forward on a marauding run. He heads into the visitors' half of the pitch before trying to tee up Candreva, but his pass is poor and fails to find the winger."

50',action,"Poor from Palacio! Icardi drops deep and picks up the ball in a pocket of space before trying to tee up Palacio, who is in a good position deep down the right wing.

The hosts have struggled at the back and out wide, where Lazovic has looked particularly dangerous, but, so far, they've managed to do enough to keep both Simeone and Ocampos at bay. The latter was presented with the best chance to score, but he didn't do enough to push Inter for a period of poor defending."

32',action,"Great opportunity for Nagatomo! Icardi picks up the ball on the edge of the Genoa box and quickly tees up Nagatomo to his left. The Japanese full-back breaks into the penalty area and quickly unleashes a low shot, but it's well saved by Perin before the linesman's flag is rightly raised for offside."
30',action,"It hasn't been the best of opening 30 minutes from Inter, and the home fans are starting to voice their frustration. The Nerazzurri are gifted with a great chance to break forward after a Genoa attack comes to an end, but Nagatomo brings it to a disappointing end with a poor pass that's too heavy for Palacio."

Mario sends a looping cross into the box that is deflected over to Palacio, but his cross towards Eder is easily dealt with."
20',action,"And now Candreva goes close! After dealing with the danger, Inter immediately hit the visitors on a counter-attack of their own.

19',action,"Off the line by D'Ambrosio! Genoa break forward on a great counter-attack as Lazovic darts down the right wing. He then cuts inside and beats Murillo with ease before firing a low shot that beats Handanovic, but D'Ambrosio is there to stop the ball from finding the back of the net."
17',action,"Munoz and Icardi clash on the halfway line as they battle for the ball in the air, resulting in a free-kick for Inter. Miranda steps up and tries to pick out Palacio with a high ball, but Munoz does well to beat the forward."

Veloso steps up and shoots from the set-piece, but his effort sails straight into the hands of Handanovic."
7',action,"Ocampos goes down inside the box, but nothing is given! Brozovic falls asleep on the ball on the edge of his own penalty area before being dispossessed by Ocampos, who then goes down under what looks like a push from the Croatian. The forward immediately throws his arms in the air and appeals for a penalty, but the referee isn't at all interested and allows play to go on."
6',action,"Simeone pushes forward on an impressive run before working the ball out to the right. A looping cross is then thumped towards the edge of the Inter penalty area and back towards the Argentine, but he's beaten in the air by a towering header from Mario."

,action,"At San Siro, Inter have dominated this fixture in recent years, winning six of the last seven meetings in Milan, whilst, with three wins from four games, Genoa have done similarly well at the Luigi Ferraris. As a result, this evening’s contest between two teams in erratic and inconsistent form could go either way, with both sides having a good chance to climb into the top half of the table."
,action,"On the same weekend that Inter impressed against Fiorentina, Genoa were having a great time themselves. They produced a wonderful performance against Juventus to comfortably beat the reigning champions 3-1 at home, with all of their goals (two of which were scored by Giovanni Simeone) coming in the opening half an hour. However, they also stuttered slightly in their following league game, resulting in them drawing 0-0 with Chievo."
,action,"Inter just about managed to leave the Derby della Madonnina with a point thanks to a last-minute Ivan Perisic equaliser and then went on to beat Fiorentina 4-2 eight days later, but in their next Serie A outing they were sent crashing back down to earth by Napoli, who comfortably won 3-0 at the Stadio San Paolo by exposing the Nerazzurri’s weakness in wide areas. Genoa will no doubt be looking to do the same tonight."
,action,"The hiring of Stefano Pioli initially gave a stuttering Inter side a lift as they tried to get their season back on track after suffering a poor start to the campaign, but they’ve struggled again in recent weeks and head into tonight’s clash in a disappointing 11th place, just one point clear of their opponents - and with a game in hand."
