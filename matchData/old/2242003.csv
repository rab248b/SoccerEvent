,action,"That wraps it up from Old Trafford. United are home and dry with a comfortable win that still sees them on the outside looking in at the top four. Goals from Mata and Martial made the difference in a match that Watford will feel fortunate to have only conceded twice. That's it from us, thanks for tuning in."
90'+2',yellow-card,Yellow Card Luis Antonio Valencia Mosquera ; Valencia lunges in on Holebas and is yellow carded.
90'+1',action,"A rushed shot for Rashford on the turn is blocked by the defence, and moments later, Pogba sends a one-two a little too far ahead of Ibrahimovic, allowing Gomes to come out and gather."
89',action,"Time trickling away here as United look to have the three points in the bag. No one has left Old Trafford yet though, because the home side have always given off a vibe that they can score more."
89',substitution,; Brief run-out for Lingard in place of Mkhitaryan.
86',action,"Ibrahimovic is lining up in the centre as Mkhitaryan breaks forward on the counter. The cross from the Armenian is met by a vital interception from Kaboul though, who clears it as well."
83',substitution,; Cathcart is withdrawn for Isaac Success.
83',action,"Ibrahimovic holds the ball up superbly and feeds Rashford out wide, with the substitute testing Gomes with an effort. The only question in the time that remains is how many United want."
81',substitution,"; Rashford replaces Martial, who gets congratulations from his manager for a great game."
80',action,"THAT COULD HAVE BEEN THREE! Ibrahimovic shows great hold-up play again to release Mkhitaryan, but his low finish is beaten away by Gomes, who hasn't done a whole lot wrong in goal."
77',action,A mini-revival for Watford here as they begin to ask more questions of the Manchester United defence. Janmaat takes aim from the edge of the box but De Gea covers his near post as it flies wide.
75',action,"GOOD PLAY! Deeney, who has been a spectator in this game, suddenly reminds everyone he's on the pitch with powerful chest control to bring a ball down and then hold off Valencia to sting the palms of De Gea."
74',substitution,; Stefano Okaka appears in place of Zarate.
73',action,That's a matchup that Watford could have exploited more in this game. Niang is clearly going to win any sort of footrace with Blind out wide. Still time for them to put more passes down that flank.
72',substitution,; Marouane Fellaini will make an appearance here in place of Mata.
71',action,"JANMAAT SHOULD HAVE SCORED! Niang gets the beating of Blind for pace, and advances to the byline before pulling back a great cross for the substitute to attack, but he skies it well over!"
69',action,"Watford are starting to push more men forward in a bid to get back in this game but all that s doing is opening up more space for United on the counter. Ibrahimovic gets on the end of one such attack, bur a deflection takes his shot into the arms of Gomes."
66',action,"Mkhitaryan shows a burst of pace that completely surprises Kaboul and sends him into the clear. He lays it off for Ibrahimovic, but the striker lashes his effort a fraction wide of the target!"
64',action,"The Hornets haven't taken a point from Old Trafford since 1985, and there's no sign of that run ending anytime soon. Unless they score twice, it will be four straight losses at this ground."
62',action,"A well-deserved goal for United and for Martial, who has been flying this afternoon and has answered some critics with his performance here. Watford better be careful this doesn't get out of hand."
60',assist,Assist Zlatan Ibrahimović ; Lovely pass from the big man.
60',goal,Goal Anthony Martial ; MARTIAL MAKES IT TWO! Capoue turns the ball over in midfield and United are down in the box in a matter of moments. Ibrahimovic threads the Frenchman through who slows down to size up and finish through a crowd.
57',action,"Mkhitaryan makes his way forward and Niang, trying to get back to halt the Armenian, lets one of his arms flail and comes across the face of the Manchester United man. Looked a painful one, but no card."
55',action,"Zarate needs no second invitation to shoot from distance, and tries another 30-yarder, this time from open play. However, De Gea doesn't have much to do this time around except fetch the ball for a goal-kick."
53',action,"Just as I say that, Watford fashion their best chance of the game and it's no surprise to see Zarate as the instigator. The Argentine curls in a delightful free-kick from 30 yards out but De Gea athletically diverts it away from goal."
51',action,"Manchester United continue to advance men forward, with the mandate from half-time clearly to keep up the tempo. Another goal for the home side and it will be hard to see Watford getting back into this one."
48',action,"Martial wastes no chance getting right back into his stride, showing good poise on the ball once again to open up shooting space on the run, but he angles his shot narrowly wide of the post."
46',substitution,; Daryl Janmaat has been introduced for Britos.
46',action,Off we go again.
,action,"And that will do it for now from Old Trafford. Watford can thank their lucky stars that Mata's goal is the only difference between the sides on the scoreboard, as they've faced a bevy of shots on Gomes' goal. Mourinho will want his side to be more clinical to finish off the opposition in the second half. I'll be back with that shortly."
45',action,"Martial has tortured Cathcart throughout the first half, and tears the defender this way and that with another dribble. However, not for the first time, Prodl is across to cover for his colleague, blocking the Frenchman."
43',action,"Watford get forward for the first time in what seems like an eternity, but in moments, it's snuffed out and United actually have a penalty appeal down at the other end as Etienne Capoue blocks the ball in the box - legally, in the referee's mind."
41',action,"Martial's pace on the counter-attack takes him away from Cathcart and forces Younes Kaboul out of position to cover. That opens up space for Mkhitaryan to arrive at the top of the box for the pass, but he lets it run too far out of his stride."
39',action,"If Manchester United manage to take the victory at home today, they will become the first Premier League side to earn 2000 points. It's going to take a lot from Watford to stop that from happening at this rate."
37',action,Everybody back behind the ball for Watford as Martial can't finish off a feed from Valencia. The Hornets will probably consider it a small victory if the manage to go into half-time only a goal down.
35',action,"That goal has been coming for a long while, and it's fully deserved for a Manchester United side that could have been a couple ahead by now were it not for their own profligacy."
32',assist,Assist Anthony Martial ; Good run down the left from the youngster.
32',goal,"Goal Juan Manuel Mata García ; THERE IT IS! Manchester United take the lead thanks to a lovely move. Mkhitaryan plays a one-two in midfield, and feeds Martial on the left, who squares for Mata to stroke home!"
32',action,"OVER THE BAR! United are turning the screw, but they haven't managed to fasten a goal on the scoreboard yet, with another miss. Mata tees up Mkhitaryan, who misses terribly in tons of space."
31',action,"Daley Blind makes an almighty run down the left flank and tees the ball up for Ander Herrera, who arrives on the far side of the area. He takes it first-time with a powerful shot, but it's well over the bar."
30',action,"Half-hour gone here and Manchester United haven't conceded in over five hours, since the League Cup final against Hull at the end of January. You would expect nothing less from a Mourinho team."
28',action,"The shots continue to rain down in this game as Pogba is the latest player to have a go. Valencia took advantage of space out wide to tee up the Frenchman, but Gomes was equal to it."
26',action,"Manchester United manage to beat Gomes from a quick free-kick, but it was too quick for the referee's liking. Moments later, Pogba picks out Ibrahimovic's brilliant run with an equally commendable ball, but the Swede volleys over on the turn."
25',action,"Deeney gets crowded out as he heads to the byline and loses the ball, but moments later, Watford manage to create an ambitious shooting chance for Zarate, who calls De Gea into action with an overhead kick."
21',action,"Now it's Manchester United who have an opportunity down at the other end as Gomes beats away Pogba's drive from distance. Moments later, the hosts dig a cross towards Chris Smalling at the back post, but it's too high for the defender."
19',action,"For the second time in this game, Holebas gets space ahead of Eric Bailly, and the full-back decides to go straight for goal instead of cutting the ball back. David de Gea was stretching, but it went wide."
17',action,"Once again, Ibrahimovic drops deep to get involved in play as an attacking midfielder drifts ahead of him. However, his pass to Mata sees the Spaniard stray beyond the last defender and an offside is called."
14',action,"GOOD RUN! Martial is too decisive for Craig Cathcart, as the young Frenchman drags the Northern Ireland defender infield before making space for a shot. However, Sebastian Prodl manages to get a block in to deflect it wide - that could have gone anywhere!"
12',action,"Despite their attention to defensive congestion, Watford have still managed to push bodies forward quickly, and Mauro Zarate's square pass to Niang sees the Milan loanee blast the ball over."
10',action,"Man Utd are purring on a few attacks, and Ibrahimovic drops deep to feed Mkhitaryan, who runs ahead of him. He shifts the ball onto his right foot and fires a low effort that Gomes does well to handle."
7',action,"Mata times a fantastic run behind the defence that sees the flag stay down as he latches onto Paul Pogba's throughball. However, Gomes rushes to the edge of his area and shows nimble feet to take the Spaniard out of the equation."
5',action,"Watford make their first significant foray into the opposition half as the ball sets up beautifully for Jose Holebas to pick out one of a multitude of teammates in the area, but he sends his cross into the stands."
3',action,"Manchester United fashion the first glimpse at a chance, with Antonio Valencia's delivery finding Zlatan Ibrahimovic for a shot that was screwed wide of the mark. Moments later, Mkhitaryan's cross to the Swede was taken by Heurelho Gomes."
1',action,Off we go!
,action,"Miguel Britos replaces Valon Behrami for the visitors in Walter Mazzarri's only change from the 2-1 win over Burnley last time out. It's a defensive 5-4-1 formation from the Hornets, with Troy Deeney leading the line, and new arrival M'Baye Niang on the left flank."
,action,"Marcus Rashford and Wayne Rooney will both have to be content with places on the bench, as Mourinho names an expected lineup with Anthony Martial, Juan Mata and Henrikh Mkhitaryan supporting Zlatan Ibrahimovic in attack."
,action,"Watford subs: Mariappa, Success, Behrami, Doucoure, Janmaat, Okaka, Arlauskis."
,action,"Watford (5-4-1): Gomes; Britos, Kaboul, Prodl, Cathcart, Holebas; Zarate, Capoue, Cleverly, Niang; Deeney."

,action,"Watford have climbed into the top half of the table thanks to victories against Arsenal and Burnley. It comes as part of a four-game unbeaten streak for the Hornets, who have two winnable home games against West Ham and Southampton before they travel to Chelsea."

A league-high nine draws (seven of those in their 15-match unbeaten streak) has seen Jose Mourinho's team frustratingly drop points at crucial intervals.
