,action,"That game was far closer than PSG would have wanted, but they've nonetheless done well to pick up an important victory that closes the gap between themselves and Ligue 1 leaders Nice to just one point. They were second best for long periods of the second half after Lyon responded brilliantly to the disappointment of the first period, and they hit the home side on an excellent counter-attack to leave the Parc Olympique Lyonnais with three much-needed points."
,action,FULL-TIME: LYON 1-2 PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN
90'+3',action,"Lyon push forward on one last attacking move as they try to find a late equaliser, but Rafael's swinging cross from the right flank fails to find a teammate inside the penalty area and is instead dealt with well by Meunier, who then charges forward before the referee's whistle is blown for the final time."
90'+2',substitution,"; PSG have made their final change of the night, with Cavani receiving a rousing round of applause from the visiting fans as he makes his way off the pitch to be replaced by Augustin."
90'+1',action,"Rafael goes close! The Brazilian, who has performed excellently when going forward this evening, cuts inside from the right flank on another great run before unleashing a 25-yard strike, but it's slightly too powerful and ends up flying a few yards over the top of the crossbar."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be two minutes of added time.
89',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Marco Verratti ; After dealing with the danger, Rafael flies forward on a determined run down the right flank, but he's cynically dragged back by Verratti, who had been well beaten by the full-back and is shown a yellow card as a result."
88',action,"Fantastic opportunity for Krychowiak to wrap up the win! PSG hit Lyon on another counter-attack that sees the reigning champions go three-on-one against the home side, but Krychowiak holds on to the ball for far too long instead of teeing up a teammate and ends up firing a low shot straight into the body of Lopes."
87',action,"What an interception by Morel! Lyon push plenty of bodies forward and PSG break forward on another counter-attack. They break forward quickly before Cavani tries to tee up Meunier, but the Uruguayan's pass is cut out by the outstretched leg of Morel at the vital moment."
86',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Thiago Emiliano da Silva ; Silva clumsily trips Lacazette to the ground as the Lyon tries to break down the right flank, and he gives away a free-kick in a dangerous position before earning himself a late yellow card."

84',action,"Rafael darts down the right flank and spins before curling a cross right on to the head of Tousart, but the substitute is slightly too far away from the PSG goal and is unable to test Areola at the near post as a result."
83',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Serge Aurier ; Aurier commits a clumsy challenge as Lyon try to break forward over on the left wing, and the full-back becomes the latest PSG player to enter the referee's book."
81',assist,"Assist Thomas Meunier ; That was an absolutely excellent cross from Meunier, who sprinted the whole length of the pitch to catch up with Aurier. PSG haven't been at their best this evening but have so far done enough to punish Lyon."
81',goal,"Goal Edinson Roberto Cavani GÃ³mez ; GOAL! PSG are back in front! A Lyon free-kick fails to result in a chance on goal and allows PSG to counter quickly. Aurier breaks down the right flank on a brilliant run before teeing up Meunier, who then whips a beautiful cross right on to the head of Cavani at the far post. The striker skips past Rafael with ease and is then able to head in his 13th goal of the season from close range. That was wonderful from the reigning champions!"
80',substitution,"; Lyon have made a late change, with Ghezzal making way for Lucas Tousart."
79',action,"Aurier and Meunier link up well deep down before the latter tries to pick out Cavani in front of goal, but the ball ends up flying past the Uruguay international before Rafael spins and volleys it out of play for a throw-in on the opposite flank."
77',action,"Maxwell, who hasn't been able to get forward anywhere near as much as he did in the first half, breaks down the left flank and swings a cross into the middle of the Lyon box, but it's sent too near to Lopes and the goalkeeper is easily able to deal with the danger."
76',action,"Calm defending by Marquinhos! Yanga-Mbiwa fires a lofted pass up the pitch and into the PSG penalty area, where Lacazette is waiting, but the striker can't get the better of Marquinhos and the Brazilian does well to nod the ball back to Areola under plenty of pressure from the number 10."
75',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Thiago Motta ; Motta, who has been flying into challenges since the break, brings down Tolisso with a late challenge and is finally showed a yellow card for the late tackle on the midfielder."
73',action,"It's all PSG at the moment as they continue to boss possession, but, as has been the case for most of the evening, they're not doing enough with the ball in advanced positions to cause the home side any real problems in and around their penalty area."
71',action,"Cavani breaks through the Lyon back line once again before trying to latch on to the ball on the edge of the box, but just as he's about to, he's dispossessed by a wonderful tackle from Diakhaby, who then blasts the ball out for a throw-in."
70',action,"Great interception by Morel! A lovely lofted pass forward finds Cavani, who then fires in a low cross from the left-hand side of the penalty area, but only Meunier is there and the substitute can't get the better of Morel in front of goal."
69',action,"Fekir flies towards the PSG penalty area as he tries to carve out a chance on goal for the home side, but Maxwell is there to dispossess him as soon as it looks as if the forward is going to penetrate the box."

66',substitution,"; PSG have made their first alteration of the evening, with Arfa making way for Thomas Meunier. It looks as if the Belgian is going to operate as a right-midfielder, allowing Lucas to join Cavani up front."
65',action,"Cavani scores, but it's ruled out for offside! Verratti sends a lovely lofted pass over the top of the Lyon defence and into the path of Cavani inside the penalty area, but the linesman's flag is raised as soon as the Uruguayan beats Lopes with a wonderful bicycle-kick."
64',action,"Fantastic opportunity for Ghezzal! A poor pass from Motta gifts Lyon with a great chance to break forward on a quick counter-attack, but Ghezzal brings a promising attacking move to a disappointing end with a heavy final touch that sends the ball rolling into the hands of Areola."
63',action,"What an interception by Morel! Ben Arfa sprints towards the edge of the Lyon penalty area before trying to tee up Lucas to his right, but Morel is there to stop the ball from finding the Brazilian with a great block."
62',action,"Lyon keep coming back at PSG and win themselves a free-kick midway inside the PSG half of the pitch over on the right wing. It's thumped in by Valbuena and flies over to Tolisso at the far post, but there's slightly too much power behind the pass and the latter is unable to keep it from flying out of play."
60',action,"Fekir goes close! Lacazette, who has looked far better during the opening 15 minutes of the second half, spins past Aurier with ease before teeing up Fekir, but the latter's first-time shot is well saved by Areola at the near post."

58',action,"Great strike by Gonalons! A misplaced pass by Lacazette is picked up by Verratti, but the Italian is quickly closed down and dispossessed. The ball is poked over to Gonalons, who breaks forward before shooting from 20 yards out, but his rocket of a shot ends up flying just past the far post."
56',action,"The pace of the game has slowed down somewhat, and it's PSG who are dominating possession once again. However, they don't look anywhere near as confident and composed as they did before the break, and it's showing in their disjointed attacking moves."
54',action,"What a chance for Lacazette! The striker, who saw little of the ball in the first half, bursts towards the near post and meets a great low cross from Morel, but he's unable to poke his shot into the back of the net after doing well to beat Areola."

It catches Lopes by surprise and almost rolls past the goalkeeper, but he does well to stop it from doing so with a diving save at the vital moment."
51',action,"After surviving the danger, PSG break forward on a quick counter-attack down the right flank. A lovely cross is fired into the heart of the penalty area and almost finds Verratti, but the ball ends up sailing just a few inches over the head of the Italian midfielder."
50',action,"Lacazette almost makes it 2-1! PSG are all over the place at the back and Areola completely misses the ball after rushing out to deal with the danger, but Lacazette is unable to take advantage of the mistake and instead loses his footing at the worst possible moment."
48',goal,"Goal Mathieu Valbuena ; GOAL! Lyon have equalised! Rafael cuts inside from the right wing and skips past Maxwell with ease before firing a curling strike past Areola and off the far post. The ball then bounces out to Valbuena, who immediately unleashes a thumping shot that flies into the back of the net."
47',action,"Fekir immediately makes an impact as he darts down the right wing before swinging a cross into the middle of the PSG penalty area, but there's nobody there to meet it and Areola does well to collect the ball."

46',substitution,"; Meanwhile, Ferri has made way for Nabil Fekir in another attacking alteration."
46',action,And we're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half.
,action,"So far, so good for PSG, who were all over Lyon for the vast majority of the first half and deserve to head into the half-time break a goal ahead. They haven't entirely been at their best, however, and that has largely been down to good defending from the home side. Whilst Maxwell and, in particular, Aurier have found far too much space out wide, Yanga-Mbiwa and Diakhaby have put in good shifts in the middle of the penalty area, which has resulted in Cavani not seeing as much of the ball as he would have liked."
,action,HALF-TIME: LYON 0-1 PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN
45'+2',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Jordan Ferri ; Lyon enjoy a positive end of the first half as they continue to put pressure on PSG, but Ferri ends up catching Verratti with another late sliding challenge and receives a yellow card with what will surely be the final action of the first half."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be two minutes of added time.
44',action,"The ball bounces around the PSG penalty area as the home side try to find an equaliser just before the half-time break, but, as he stretches to try and make contact with the ball, Ferri ends up lunging into Motta and catches the Italian, resulting in a free-kick for the visitors."
43',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Blaise Matuidi ; Matuidi had dragged back Tolisso in the build-up to Lyon's last chance, and he's eventually shown a yellow card once the ball goes out of play."
43',action,"Lyon are presented with a great opportunity to hit PSG on the counter after some sloppy play from the visitors, but Rafael's low cross in from the right wing is terribly hit and misses every available white shirt before finding Motta on the edge of the box."
42',action,"Aurier gets himself into a good position near to the byline over on the right flank, and, once again, a low cross from him results in a corner for PSG. Ben Arfa's cross from the set-piece is well executed and sails into a dangerous area, but Lopes rushes out to collect the ball under pressure from a group of PSG players."
40',action,"PSG win themselves yet another corner over on the right wing, but it's just about dealt with by the home side, who then try to break away on a quick counter-attack. Lacazette holds up the ball well before spinning and finding Ferri, but the midfielder's first touch is poor and gifts possession back to the visitors."
38',action,"Silva's clearance results in another corner for the home side, but this one is well dealt with by the reigning champions. The ball ends up bouncing out to Yanga-Mbiwa, however, and the defender immediately unleashes a fierce strike from 30 yards out that, unsurprisingly, sails well over the top of the crossbar."
37',action,"Rafael gets himself into a good position deep down the right flank and fires a bouncing cross into the heart of the PSG penalty area that Silva is just about able to clear out for a corner. The ball in is lovely and almost finds Tolisso in front of goal, but, again, Silva is there to deal with the danger after Alphonse Areola completely missed the ball."
36',action,"Lucas almost makes it 2-0! Ben Arfa flies forward on a great run before teeing up Cavani on the edge of the penalty area. The Uruguayan spots Lucas to his right and immediately pokes the ball over to the Brazilian, who beats Lopes with his first-time cross-cum-shot but can only send it rolling just wide of the far post."
34',action,"Rafael is just about able to deal with Matuidi deep down the left wing and the PSG man has to settle for yet another corner. Ben Arfa steps up and whips it straight on to the head of Silva, but the captain's downward header fails to beat Lopes after taking a deflection."
33',action,"Another dangerous cross from Aurier! The full-back skips past his marker with ease before sending a beautiful ball into the box and towards Cavani, but, not for the first time this evening, Yanga-Mbiwa is there to head it away from danger."
32',action,"PSG quickly win the ball back from the restart and continue pushing forward and putting pressure on the home side. Lyon have really struggled to get anywhere near the ball thus far, leaving Lacazette as a lonely figure near the halfway line."
30',penalty-goal,"Penalty Goal Edinson Roberto Cavani GÃ³mez ; GOAL! After Motta takes his time getting back to his feet, Cavani eventually steps up and fires a great strike straight down the middle of the goal and into the back of the net to make it 12 goals in 12 league games for the Uruguayan."
28',action,"PENALTY! The corner is thumped into the middle of the box and finds Motta, who immediately tries to spin past Rafael but is kicked in the shin by the Brazilian, leaving the referee with no choice but to point to the spot."
27',action,"Lyon move the ball around nicely before Ghezzal loses the ball, allowing PSG to push forward on yet another attack. They keep hold of possession patiently before Aurier sends another low cross towards the near post, but Diakhaby is there to clear the danger with another important block."
25',action,"What an opportunity for Lucas! Marco Verratti picks out Aurier with a wonderful pass that finds the full-back in acres of space down the right flank. The defender meets it well before teeing up Lucas with an excellent low cross, but the forward's attempted first-time flick isn't a clean one and fails to beat Lopes."
24',action,"Lopes just about manages to hold on! The corner is whipped into the middle of the penalty area and bounces off two players before rolling towards goal, but Lopes is just about able to get down quickly to stop it from finding the back of the net."
23',action,"Lucas Moura goes down inside the penalty area, but nothing is given! Matuidi charges down the left wing and cuts inside before firing a great cross into the path of Lucas in the heart of the penalty area, and the Brazilian quickly goes down under a push from Morel. The referee isn't at all interested in the PSG players' pleas, however, and only awards them a corner."
22',action,"Vital block by Rafael! The ball pinballs around the Lyon penalty area as PSG desperately try to find a way in front, but a cross from Maxwell is dealt with well by Yanga-Mbiwa before Blaise Matuidi's follow-up shot is closed down by Rafael."
21',action,"Lyon push forward well and win themselves a throw-in deep down the left wing. Morel takes it quickly and sends the ball towards Tolisso, who had made a good run into the left-hand side of the PSG box, but his first touch is poor and denies him the opportunity to fire a cross towards Lacazette."
19',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Hatem Ben Arfa ; Ouch! Maxime Gonalons picks up the ball on the halfway line and is immediately caught on the back of the ankle from Ben Arfa, leaving the Lyon midfielder in a heap on the floor and resulting in a yellow card for the PSG forward."
18',action,"After several minutes sitting on the back foot, Lyon are finally able to push forward on another attempted attacking move. Corentin Tolisso gets himself into the good position just outside of the PSG penalty area and tries to set up Alexandre Lacazette with a chipped pass forward, but there's slightly too much power behind it and it ends up bouncing out of play."
17',action,"Poor play from Ben Arfa! Once again, a promising PSG attacking move breaks down as a result of a misplaced pass. This time it comes from Ben Arfa, who sprints towards the Lyon penalty area and tries to tee up Aurier but sends his ball forward out for a goal-kick."
16',action,"Maxwell makes a smart run down the left flank as he tries to latch on to a lofted pass forward from Motta, but it's overhit by the PSG midfielder and bounces harmlessly out of play before it can find the full-back."
14',action,"Great chance for Motta! The resulting set-piece is swung into the heart of the box and finds Motta in a great position in front of goal, but the Italian is unable to hit the target with his downward header and instead sends it bouncing just wide of the near post."
13',action,"PSG are firing cross after cross into the Lyon penalty area, but, so far, the home side have managed to deal with the all of them. This time it's Diakhaby who denies Aurier before Ben Arfa tries to muscle his way into the right-hand side of the box, but the former Lyon man has to settle for a corner after being unable to beat two players."
12',action,"Once again, Maxwell gets himself into a good position over on the left flank before swinging a dangerous cross towards the head of Cavani, but it clears the Uruguayan in front of goal before Mouctar Diakhaby clears the danger at the vital moment."
11',action,"A misplaced pass from Ben Arfa fails to find a blue shirt and instead sails over to Rachid Ghezzal on the halfway line. He brings it down nicely before trying to kick-start a swift Lyon counter-attack, but Thiago Silva is there to confidently dispossess the forward."
9',action,"Maxwell gets himself into a good position deep down the left wing before swinging a dangerous cross into the middle of the penalty area, but it flies just over the head of Cavani before being cleared by Yanga-Mbiwa. The defender's clearance can only find Aurier, however, but the full-back ends up firing his audacious follow-up shot well over the top of the crossbar from 30 yards out."
7',action,"Cavani makes a great run through the middle of the Lyon defence as he tries to latch on to a lovely pass forward from Ben Arfa, but just as he's about to reach the ball on the edge of the penalty area, Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa cuts out the danger with a vital interception."
5',action,"Lyon move the ball around nicely as they carve out their first chance on goal. Maciej Rybus cuts inside from the right flank and quickly finds Jordan Ferri, who is in a great position on the edge of the box. The midfielder takes a quick touch before looking to shoot, but just as he's about to, he's pushed to the ground by Thiago Motta. The referee ignores the hosts' pleas for a free-kick, however, and allows play to go on."
3',action,"The corner fails to result in a chance on goal for the visitors but PSG quickly come back once again. Aurier gets himself into a good position deep down the right wing for the second time in as many minutes before sending another cross into the penalty area, but Anthony Lopes gets a hand on the ball to stop it from finding Edinson Cavani."
2',action,"Hatem Ben Arfa shows great skill as he weaves his way towards the Lyon penalty area before teeing up Serge Aurier to his right. The full-back is in a pocket of space and immediately whips a dangerous cross into the box, but Jeremy Morel is there to thump the ball out for an early PSG corner."
1',action,"And we're off! Lyon get us underway, attacking from right to left."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."
,action,"Meanwhile, PSG boss Unai Emery has made just two alterations to the team that featured in the 2-2 draw away to Arsenal on Wednesday evening, with Thomas Meunier and Grzegorz Krychowiak making way for Serge Aurier and Hatem Ben Arfa, the latter of whom comes in to make his first league start since early September, and against the club where his professional career began."
,action,"Bruno Genesio has decided to make four changes to the Lyon side that started the win against Dinamo Zagreb during the week, with Mouctar Diakhaby, Corentin Tolisso, Rachid Ghezzal and Maciej Rybus coming into the starting line-up to replace Nicolas NâKoulou, Sergi Darder, Maxwell Cornet and Mathieu Valbuena, respectively."

,action,"Thereâs just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so letâs have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this eveningâ¦"
,action,"PSG have dominated this fixture in recent years, despite Lyon winning the corresponding fixture last season. The reigning champions easily won 4-1 in the French Super Cup meeting between the two sides back in August, and, bar the win during the last campaign, Lyon have only beaten the Parisians on one occasion in the past four and a half years."
,action,"A difficult month-long period starting at the end of September saw Lyon lose three of their four Ligue 1 clashes, but they currently find themselves in impressive form and, like their opponents today, have won all of their previous three league games. They also picked up a 1-0 win against Dinamo Zagreb during the week to keep alive their chances of reaching the knockout stage of the Champions League."
,action,"After losing against Monaco and Toulouse early in the campaign, PSG have improved in recent weeks and head south to Lyon with three consecutive league victories under their belts. Lille, Rennes and Nantes have all fallen to the Parisians in recent weeks, but Lyon, who are in good form themselves, should prove to be tougher opponents for the reigning champions."
,action,"Games between Lyon and PSG always prove to be exciting affairs, and todayâs clash is set to be no different. This season has shown that PSGâs dominance of Ligue 1 is no more, and a somewhat stuttering start to life under Unai Emery has left them in third place in the table. A win today will move them equal on points with both leaders Monaco and second-place Nice, and itâs a result that they desperately need if they are to avoid falling further behind the leagueâs pacesetters."
,action,Good evening and welcome to our live text commentary of todayâs Ligue 1 game between Lyon and Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais.
