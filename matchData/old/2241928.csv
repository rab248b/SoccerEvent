,action,"That's all for our live coverage, thanks for following along. Goodbye!"
,action,"Mark Noble's 74th minute penalty, following a questionable decision from Lee Mason, is sees the Hammers to steal three points, with the Tigers striking the woodwork three times. Hull drop further towards the bottom, while West Ham climb away from the relegation zone."
90'+6',action,FULL-TIME: WEST HAM 1-0 HULL CITY.
90'+5',yellow-card,Yellow Card Harry Maguire ; A late booking here for Harry Maguire.
90'+3',substitution,"; The Hammers make their final change to run time off the clock and disrupt the flow of the match. It's Payet who gives way, with Havard Nordtveit taking his place."
90'+2',action,"SO NEARLY THE CLINCHER! Another mazy run from Payet as the game opens up for him with Hull having to commit bodies forward. He drops his shoulder and switches onto his right, cleverly, but can't thread an effort in at the far post as Marshall collects!"
90',action,"There will be four tense, nervy minutes added on at the end of this match."
88',action,"STUNNING CHALLENGE! Vital last-ditch slide there from Clucas to thwart Antonio, who was played through behind the defence quite spectacularly by Payet! West Ham look threatening on the break, while Hull continue to fade."
86',substitution,; A final roll of the dice here from Phelan as he brings on Jarrod Bowen to replace Huddlestone.
85',action,"FINE SAVE! Payet's effort is the best he's produced all afternoon from a set-piece, but Marshall parries! That would have ended the match!"
84',yellow-card,Yellow Card Markus Henriksen ; Henriksen is booked as he trips up Payet on the edge of the area following a dazzling run from the Frenchman.
82',action,STAT: West Ham United have dropped a league-high 12 points from winning positions this season.
80',action,"When you're at the bottom of the table, nothing does seem to go your way. Hull have been placed in an unlikely hole here, but they have to find a way to persevere and keep at it over the final 10 minutes. West Ham have new life about them, and if the Tigers switch off, it will no doubt be game over."
78',action,"This is incredibly harsh on Hull. They've hit the woodwork three times, been denied by Randolph another couple of times, and had an effort cleared off the line. They could have been 3-0 or 4-0 up easily, but instead a soft penalty decision goes against them and they now trail at the London Stadium. Unbelievable."
76',penalty-goal,"Penalty Goal Mark Noble ; NOBLE CONVERTS! Against all odds, West Ham lead! Noble coolly rolls his penalty to the right, sending Marshall the wrong way and putting the Hammers in front!"
75',action,"PENALTY TO WEST HAM! Antonio shields off Huddlestone, turning smartly before going to ground under slight contact, and Lee Mason points to the spot! It's a real soft challenge in the end. There will be questions asked about that decision following the match."
74',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Michael Dawson ; Dawson puts in a professional challenge to stop a break, taking one for the team as he goes into the book. It comes seconds after Hull squandered a terrific opportunity on a counter of their own, getting a bit too cute with their passing as West Ham were able to get bodies back."
72',action,STAT: West Ham United have scored the highest proportion of goals from set-pieces this season in the Premier League (12/18 - 67%).
70',substitution,"; Adama Diomande also comes into the game, replacing Mbokani."
69',substitution,; Hull make their first two changes of the afternoon here. Markus Henriksen comes on in place of Livermore with the first.
68',action,"What an absolutely exceptional game this is turning into! Riveting, end to end action at the London Stadium, yet somehow it remains scoreless! Hull are deserving of the three points, it must be said, but it's really anyone's guess as to how this turns out!"
66',action,"OFF THE LINE AGAIN! UNBELIEVABLE! For a third time tonight Maguire comes close, again this time from a header, sending a bouncing effort back towards the far post. It gets by Randolph, but Antonio rises to keep it out!"
64',action,"GOAL-SAVING TACKLE! Ayew sees a header cleared off the line by Robertson at one end, and back the other way come Hull. A friendly ricochet off Mbokani sends Clucas through, but Kouyate recovers brilliantly to slide in and snuff out the chance! Clucas appeared to be cleanly through on goal there!"
62',action,STAT: Hull City are on a run of six successive away defeats in the Premier League and they have failed to score in the last four of these.
60',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Mark Noble ; And now Noble is booked for a foul on Huddlestone. He tried to pull out at the last second, but was unsuccessful in doing so."
60',action,"OFF THE POST AGAIN! Well how's your luck?! Hull absolutely buzzing around the West Ham goal, with the Hammers all over the place at the moment! Robertson hammers a strike at goal from the left channel and beats Randolph, but it smacks off the inside of the far post and stays on the wrong side of the line as it comes back across the face of goal!"
58',action,"YIKES! Another huge letoff for West Ham! Noble lunges back to put in a defensive header, and it's a rather brilliant one had it been at the other end of the pitch, but it's not, and it nearly results in an own goal! He beats Randolph clean, but sends it crashing off the inside of the post, before it's scrambled clear."
56',action,"West Ham squander a corner and Hull break quickly, in numbers. Reid runs the entire length of the pitch to get back and put in a challenge, rather remarkably, forcing the ball behind for a corner, which subsequently comes to nothing."
54',action,"Better spell here from West Ham, and their supporters are encouraged as the noise level increases for the first time in a long time. They're just starting to back the Hammers again, and that may be the boost they need to pull themselves back into the game."
52',action,STAT: West Ham's last six Premier League goals against Hull have all come in the second half of games.
50',action,"Hull have a real confidence about them as they get forward, but they need a goal to show for it. All it takes is one West Ham attack and they could be down, an almost unfathomable thought for Phelan and the Tigers considering how the first 50 minutes have played out."
48',action,"West Ham seem to have shifted into a 4-4-2 now, with Kouyate moving over to right-back and Ayew joining Carroll up top. Still, the changes have not resulted in much of a change of pace early on in this second half, as West Ham continue to struggle in possession."
46',action,Hull get the second half underway...
46',substitution,"; Also into the game for the Hammers is Edimilson Fernandes, replacing Obiang."
46',substitution,; Bilic has made two changes after a toothless first-half showing from his side. The first of which sees Andre Ayew replace Manuel Lanzini.
,action,"A chorus of boos scattered throughout the London Stadium as West Ham head down the tunnel, incredibly lucky not to be trailing. Hull City have been by far the better side after 45 minutes, but Mbokani struck the post and Randolph did brilliantly to deny Maguire as the Tigers still await the opener they deserve."
45'+3',action,HALF-TIME: WEST HAM 0-0 HULL CITY.
45'+1',action,There will be three minutes added on at the end of this first half.
45',action,"AN INCH AWAY! Maguire, of all people, forward on the break and behind the defence. A deflected ball over the top nearly falls perfectly for him, but Obiang is able to intervene, poking the ball away but so nearly into his own net, as it crashes into the side netting!"
43',action,"Has to be better! Snodgrass wins a 50-50 ball in midfield, turning smartly to get forward before playing a ball into the area for Livermore. The midfielder shifts onto his right, but slices a strike high, wide and not so handsome. Still, it's Hull who remain the only side getting these sights at goal."
41',action,STAT: Hull City have conceded the first goal of the game on 13 occasions this season in the Premier League; more often than any other team.
39',action,"Now Maguire has himself a shot on target, from just outside the area, but Randolph makes what ends up being a relatively straightforward save. That's the second time the West Ham keeper has been called into action by the centre-half."
37',action,"JUST OVER! Dawson flicks on Robertson's ball over the top, into the path of Mbokani, who turns and hammers a volley at goal, but it's sent just over the bar! Hull really should be ahead in this first half - West Ham using up their nine lives."
36',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Pedro Mba Obiang Avomo ; Obiang lunges into Clucas, a dangerous challenge, and it sees him into the book. That's the fifth yellow of the season for Obiang, which means he will get his Christmas off."
34',action,"Plenty of anticipation and deliberation as West Ham prepare to take the free-kick. Plenty of bodies stand over it, but it was always going to be Payet who takes. He does, but the quality in the strike is lacking as he sends an effort straight at Marshall."
32',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Jake Livermore ; OUCH! Really a careless intervention from Livermore who sticks a foot out and catches Carroll in the midriff. He had really no chance of winning the ball there and has to be smarter in keeping his foot down. That's a free-kick in a threatening position for West Ham, and a yellow for Livermore."
31',action,"Lanzini is eventually able to walk off under his own power, and looks alright to continue. The match is able to get underway again, and you have to imagine there will be a fair bit of time added on at the end of this first half as Lanzini's injury follows that to Marshall earlier in the half."
29',action,"Lanzini has picked up a knock now for West Ham, as it continues to get worse for Bilic. It didn't look like a muscle strain as much as perhaps a dead leg following a collision, but he's staying sown for an extended period here."
27',action,"Mike Phelan will be content with how his side have played, but the fact that the game remains scoreless will be a source of worry for him. The Tigers hardly create an abundance of chances, so when they do come along, it's so important they take them."
25',action,"SUPER SAVE! That's the sort of delivery West Ham have been craving, but it's Hull who find it. Snodgrass floats in an exceptional corner, placing it onto the head of an unmarked Maguire, but his powerful header is kept out by the strong left hand of Randolph at full-stretch!"
23',action,"STAT: West Ham have conceded the most goals from open play in the Premier League this season (25), and have also scored the joint-fewest in this manner (6)."
21',action,"MASSIVE LETOFF! Hull can ill-afford to miss those sorts of chances if they are to stave off relegation! A dreadful backpass from Cresswell comes up short. Mbokani pounces and beats Randolph cleanly with his early shot, but pings it off the inside of the post! Finest of margins there, as West Ham escape a massive scare."
19',action,"Noble squanders possession cheaply in midfield, allowing Hull to break through Clucas. He threads a pass across for Mbokani, who twists and turns on the edge of the box before firing for goal, narrowly missing at the near post."
17',action,"Payet's deliveries from set-pieces have lacked quality thus far. With the likes of Carroll, Antonio, Reid and Kouyate out on the pitch, it's really important for West Ham to make more of these dead-ball situations."
15',action,"DEFLECTED OVER! Crucial block in the end from Davies who manages to square up and turn Payet's shot behind, after the Frenchman did brilliantly to dance his way into the penalty area from the flank. That looked a real chance for the hosts, but there was no way through for Payet's shot in the end."
13',action,"STAT: West Ham have won six successive league games at home against Hull City, not losing to the Tigers in home league meeting since January 1990."
11',action,"After a bit of patch-work from the training staff, Marshall props up and looks alright to continue all of a sudden, when just a minute ago, it looked as though his race had been run. It's an encouraging sign, but something still worth keeping an eye on."
9',action,"Marshall collects a Payet cross from the right, with no one pressuring him, but the keeper seems to have tweaked something as he puts the ball straight out of play and gives a grimacing look over to the touchline. It's a real innocuous injury, but a big blow nonetheless for the Tigers so early in this match, away from home."
7',action,"Antonio's aerial prowess is matched by few on the pitch, except for maybe Carroll. The wing-back makes a teasing run into the area, offering himself as a target for Lanzini's delivery, but the cross from the Argentine leaves him with little chance of getting a head to it."
5',action,"There's been hardly a glimpse at goal for either side thus, with the exception of a blocked Payet strike from 25 yards. It's all very sluggish and pedestrian in the early stages. It's there for the taking, now who will take charge?"
3',action,"Very timid and cagey start to proceedings in the London Stadium. Given Hull's struggles away from home, you would expect West Ham to take the initiative early on and push the tempo, but that's hardly been the case thus far."
1',action,"AND WE'RE OFF! West Ham in their claret and blue home strip as they get us underway, attacking left to right, with Hull in their amber and black stripes."
,action,"Mike Phelan makes just one change to his side from the lopsided defeat at Tottenham on Wednesday, with Dieumerci Mbokani brought in to lead the line, with Adama Diomande dropped to the bench. Robert Snodgrass joins the DR Congo man in attack, but will slot in just behind him as the number 10."
,action,"Andy Carroll leads the line for Slaven Bilic's unchanged side, flanked by Dimitri Payet and Manuel Lanzini. Mark Noble and Pedro Obiang provide cover for the back three, while Michail Antonio and Aaron Cresswell man the flanks."
,action,"SUBS: Meyler, Maloney, Jakupovic, Weir, Diomande, Henriksen, Bowen."
,action,"HULL CITY (3-5-2): Marshall; Maguire, Dawson, Davies; Elmohamady, Livermore, Huddlestone, Clucas, Robertson; Snodgrass; Mbokani."
,action,"SUBS: Nordtveit, Feghouli, Adrian, Ayew, Fletcher, Fernandes, Quina."
,action,"WEST HAM (3-4-3): Randolph; Kouyate, Reid, Ogbonna; Antonio, Noble, Obiang, Cresswell; Lanzini, Payet, Carroll."
,action,CONFIRMED TEAM NEWS:
,action,"Their road form has been particularly haunting. Mike Phelan’s side have not won away from the KCOM Stadium since August, while failing to score a league goal on their travels since mid-October – and the pressure is only intensifying."
,action,"Hull are in a much more worrisome predicament, entrenched in the relegation zone with the threat of a Championship return looming. Reinforcements are needed – hopefully they’re on Santa’s nice list."
,action,"What’s been most surprising for Slaven Bilic’s side is the time it’s taking for them to adjust to their new home. The rustic fortress of the Boleyn was exchanged for the bright lights of the London Stadium, but the move has been littered with speed bumps."
,action,"West Ham got a big win on Wednesday to put a bit of breathing room between them and the bottom three, but it’s a long way back for them to rediscover their magical form of last season."
,action,Hello and welcome to live coverage from the London Stadium as West Ham aim to pull further away from the relegation zone when they host a reeling Hull City side.
