,action,"What an incredible finish to the game as Hertha are floored and frustrated at conceding late on - especially when they feel that the five minutes of stoppage time were up. They had a case, but let's not forget that their goal came after a dubious free-kick against Vidal. Bayern escape once again, but their lead could be cut to five points by the end of the weekend. That's it from us, see you soon."
90'+7',yellow-card,Yellow Card Rune Almenning Jarstein ; Jarstein is booked for complaining about that dramatic goal.
90'+6',goal,"Goal Robert Lewandowski ; THEY HAVE DONE IT! UNBELIEVABLE! Thiago's delivery is teed up for Robben inside the area. The effort was blocked, Jarstein was out of position, and Lewandowski pokes in the rebound!"
90'+6',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Peter Pekarík ; Pekarik fouls Coman right on the edge of the area. Booking, and now then..."
90'+4',substitution,; Lustenberger has replaced Haraguchi late on.
90'+3',action,"The stadium stopped whistling for a second to hold its collective breath as Robben has a snap-shot inside the box. Robben rolls right off-balance, and so does the ball, to a cheer of relief."
90'+2',substitution,; Mittelstadt is on and Kalou is off.
90'+1',action,"All hands to the pump for Hertha as we enter stoppage time. Dardai still has two substitutions in hand, having only brought on Esswein so far. Some more changes could be in store to run down the clock."
89',action,"JARSTEIN MAKES THE SAVE! The Norwegian international keeper dives to his left to parry Alaba's clever strike. It was at a good height for him, but the boost that save gave the crowd and the defence will help them get over the line."
88',action,Darida's misfiring afternoon continues as he makes a clumsy challenge that Hummels also sells well. It's about 20 yards out and Bayern will be salivating at the thought of this one.
87',substitution,; Ibisevic is off for Alexander Esswein.
85',action,"Bayern continue to pule bodies forward, but there's just not that sense that they're close to a goal. Hertha are far from hanging on - they even launch a counter that could have led to a shot, if Haraguchi and Pekarik didn't get their wires crossed."
82',action,"After a poor free-kick that failed to even make it into the area, Costa does much better from open play, causing panic in the area that freezes the defence, before Jarstein takes command with a catch."
80',action,"Bayern win a free-kick outside of shooting range, but they argue that it should have been more after Alonso went down. Replays show that the visitors were lucky to get the call in the first place."
77',substitution,"; There's a Hertha player down, and Bayern aren't happy that they have to kick the ball out of play to allow the physios to come on. Ancelotti takes that opportunity to introduce Kingsley Coman in place of Bernat."
75',action,"Fifteen minutes to go now, and this is the period where Bayern have scored 11 times in the league, a joint record. However, Hertha have proved as tough a nut to crack as any."
73',action,"Bayern are starting to apply more pressure as we approach the last quarter-hour of this game. Lahm forces a move down the right, but Hertha get bodies in place before Langkamp makes the clearance."
70',action,"Langkamp gives away a very threatening free-kick in shooting range and Lewandowski is locking his chops at the prospect of this. There's a little skip in his run-up, but it doesn't even make it to the keeper."
68',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Xabier Alonso Olano ; Alonso takes out Haraguchi, and is shown a card, much to the displeasure of Lewandowski."
67',action,"Bayern are getting quite irritable here, and they feel that they've not had the benefit of the doubt on a couple of decisions here. That frustration is seeping into their play, which continues to look disjointed."
66',yellow-card,Yellow Card Robert Lewandowski ; Lewandowski joins Hummels in the book for a frustration foul on Brooks.
64',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Mats Hummels ; Professional foul from Hummels, who brings down Ibisevic, knowing that his side faced a dangerous counter otherwise. Yellow card."
63',action,"Two very attack-minded changes from Ancelotti. Alonso will immediately pick up the vacated sput by Kimmich in central midfield, with Thiago dropping deeper to partner his compatriot. Lewandowski will lead the line, and Muller will now play just behind him."
61',substitution,; Kimmich is withdrawn for Alonso.
61',substitution,"; That's Vidal's last act, or non-act of the game, as Lewandowski replaces him."
61',action,"Lahm tries to drive centrally but, seeing the door shut, he intelligently drags the ball back for Thiago on the edge of the area. He ignores a great run from Vidal to have a crack, but it's a comfortable save for the keeper."
59',action,Hertha look just as likely to get a second goal on the board as Bayern do to drawing level. There's been quite a few sides who have been in the game against the Bavarians until around the hour mark when fatigue kicks in. Will it be different for Dardai's team?
57',action,"SAVED BY NEUER! To be fair, it was a stop you would expect a keeper of his calibre to make, but there was still the potential for a nasty surprise as Darida's pull-up effort from the edge of the box took a deflection."
55',action,"SHOULD HAVE DONE BETTER! Hertha turn defence into attack in a matter of seconds, as Kalou leads the charge. With Hummels outnumbered, he spreads it for Haraguchi, who can't take advantage of a good position 15 yards out!"
52',action,"It looks like the Lahm-Robben combination on the right-hand side will be the best source of a breakthrough for the visitors. The pair combine again as the Dutchman gets space around the area, but he can't trouble Jarstein."
50',action,"Plattenhardt once again plays a great ball into the box, this time from open play. Ibisevic attacks it at the near post, but can't force Manuel Neuer into a save from close range. He's appealing for a corner that doesn't come."
48',action,"Not a lot of teams play defensive football at home, but it's working well for Dardi and his team. who have conceded only four goals at the Olympistadion, a league low."
46',action,Here we go again.
,action,"The half-time whistle blows, and only one side will be smiling heading down the tunnel. A spirited Hertha team have taken a 1-0 lead into the break thanks to a strike from Ibisevic. They've asked plenty of questions from Bayern, who seem to be suffering a European hangover with an indecisive display. Stay tuned for the restart soon."
45',action,"Costa beats Pekarik then turns on the afterburners to storm past Haraguchi across the byline. He puts in a good chest-height cross into the six-yard area, where an inadvertent touch from Plattenhardt gives Jarstein the opportunity to smother."
43',action,"Hertha have numbers forward again bu Lahm gets the better of Kalou once more on a long bal down the line. However, the full-back's clearance is poor, but Bayern are bailed out by a dubious Darida foul."
41',action,"GOAL RULED OUT! Brooks flicks down a corner to Ibisevic at the far post, but the striker was clearly offside as he converted. Bayern struggle from a set-piece again though - they didn't win the initial header nor had any men on the posts."
39',action,"Ibisevic gets the ball in what looks like a nowhere position, but he shows tremendous skill to beat his man, only for Hummels to peel away from Kalou and make the interception. Terrible turnover from Alaba in that sequence."
37',action,"Kimmich plays a good pass for Robben, who opts to let it run onto his right foot instead of cutting inside. John Brooks is across to cover, but the Dutchman gets a shot away that draws a save from Jarstein."
34',action,"Robben tries to make headway down the right-hand side, and squeezes a pass into Lahm, who shows tremendous footwork and poise to keep possession under pressure. He then lays one off for Vidal, but the Chilean's shot is charged down."
32',action,"Kimmich puts in an enticing delivery that's just a little to high for Muller, and not quite long enough for Costa. Moments later, Bernat plays a cute ball with the outside of his boot, but Muller is offside."
30',action,"Hertha are showing great appetite in this game to prevent Bayern from settling into any kind or rhythym. Pal Dardai clearly did his homework to prepare his side on the training pitch, and it's paying off so far."
27',action,"Bayern try to get back on track with a free-kick delivery of their own, but Muller can only guide his header into Jarstein's grasp. Moments later, a cross falls to Bernat on the left-hand side, but an ill-advised volley goes haywire."
25',action,"Bayern will be a little cheesed that the free-kick came from a dubious foul against Arturo Vidal, but they have only themselves to blame. Muller should have dealt with that. Instead, Ibisevic broke a goal drought of over 600 minutes for his ninth of the season."
23',action,"Robben waits for Lahm to make an overlapping run, with the full-back latching onto the pass and pinging in a superb cross to the near post that requires a special piece of handling from Rune Jarstein to deny Muller a shot."
21',assist,Assist Marvin Plattenhardt ; What a ball from Plattenhardt!
21',goal,"Goal Vedad Ibišević ; HERTHA BERLIN HAVE THE LEAD! The home side win a free-kick on the left-hand side, and Marvin Plattenhardt swings in the dead ball. Ibisevic sneaks in behind Muller and sticks out a leg to convert in some style!"
20',action,"Pekarik continues to get forward, and to his credit, wins a corner after a driving run. A host of defenders come forward but they shouldn't have bothered, because Vladimir Darida's delivery went out of play before it bent back in."
18',action,"After a bright opening for both teams in the opening five minutes, the game has become more of a chess match, with both sides trading more cautious blows."
16',action,"Peter Pekarik picks a peck of Philipp...I give up. The Hertha defender sweeps the legs away from the Bayern veteran. You're not going to get away with that challenge, especially with the referee 10 yards away."
14',action,"It looks set to be another record-breaking year for Bayern domestically, with their seven-point lead over Leipzig already looking insurmountable. And that's despite claims that the Bavarians haven't looked the same since Pep Guardiola left."
12',action,"Better from Bayern as they focus on keeping possession and frustrating the home side, making them do all the work chasing the ball. David Alaba is then called harshly for a foul on Ibisevic."
9',action,"Thiago sprays an excellent ball out wide for Juan Bernat to chase on the overlap, but the full-back can't wrap his foot properly around the ball as his cross goes behind the goal."
7',action,"Once again, it's a good switch of play from the capital club as Salomon Kalou is isolated on the left-hand side against Philipp Lahm, but the veteran defender doesn't let him get the cross in with a block. The resulting corner is flicked menacingly across the face of goal."
5',action,"Bayern win a corner and it's played short to Arjen Robben. They work it to Douglas Costa at the top of the box, but the ex-Shakhtar man's ambitious effort is blocked before it reaches the goal."
3',action,"High tempo to start the game here, and Bayern have to be on their game defensively as Hertha twice get down the line to swing the ball into the penalty area. Encouraging signs from the hosts."
1',action,We're off!
,action,"Carlo Ancelotti rotates his squad after their Champions League exertions, with Robert Lewandowski getting a breather on the bench as Thomas Muller starts up top. Joshua Kimmich replaces Xabi Alonso, while Javi Martinez also sits for Juan Bernat."
,action,"Vedad Ibisevic has shaken off a minor ankle concern to lead the line for the home side this afternoon. Niklas Stark anchors a five-man midfield, although there's no room in the XI for 19-year-old Maximilian Mittelstadt."
,action,"Bayern subs: Martinez, Lewandowski, Rafinha, Alonso, Ulreich, Coman, Renato Sanches."
,action,"Bayern (4-2-3-1): Neuer; Lahm, Hummels, Alaba, Bernat; Vidal, Kimmich; Robben, Thiago, Costa; Muller."
,action,"Hertha subs: Kraft, Esswein, Allagui, Stocker, Lustenberger, Mittelstadt, Torunarigha."
,action,"Hertha (4-1-4-1): Jarstein; Pekarik, Langkamp, Brooks, Plattenhardt; Stark; Haraguchi, Darida, Skjelbred, Kalou; Ibisevic."
,action,"Bayern hold a seven-point lead over RB Leipzig, with a 1-1 draw against Schalke in February their only blip in the league since losing to Borussia Dortmund in November. They also have one foot in the Champions League quarter-finals thanks to a 5-1 first-leg win over Arsenal."
,action,"Hertha's shoddy form has seen them drop to sixth in the table, although with only six points separating third from ninth, there's plenty of jockeying bound to happen in the standings in the coming weeks. However, they've won eight of nine at home, conceding a league-low four goals on their own patch."
,action,"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Bundesliga match between Hertha Berlin and Bayern Munich. The hosts have lost three of their last four in the league, and face a side who have won four of their last five."
