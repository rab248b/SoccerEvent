,action,"In the end, it was a very comfortable afternoon for Burnley, who were easily able to see off a Sunderland side that continually looked weak and disorganised at the back. O'Shea and Djilobodji were all over the place, with the latter constantly failing to get the better of Barnes and Gray. The latter was in great form from start to finish to help guide his side to three well-earned points, and he will leave with the match ball after picking up his first ever Premier League hat-trick."

90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be three minutes of added time.
89',action,"Almost a terrible mistake by Mannone! The goalkeeper rushes out to try and deal with a lofted pass forward but completely misses the ball on the edge of his own penalty area.

87',action,"Larsson gets himself into a pocket of space 30 yards away from goal and tries to beat Heaton with an audacious long-range strike, but it's completely overhit and sails well wide of its intended target."
86',action,"Arfield goes close! The ball pinballs around the Sunderland box as the visitors fail to clear the danger. It eventually bounces over to Arfield, who is in a good position in front of goal, but the midfielder is unable to catch the bouncing ball as well as he would have liked and sends his volleyed effort just over the top of the crossbar."
85',substitution,"; James Tarkowski comes on to replace Barnes, who receives a round of applause from the home fans as he makes way."
84',action,"The corner initially fails to result in a chance on goal before Defoe unleashes a thumping shot that is deflected out for yet another corner.

74',action,"A lofted pass forward isn't fully dealt with by Jones, allowing Gudmundsson to whip in a cross from the left wing that the defender is just about able to poke over the top of the crossbar and out for a corner. The resulting set-piece is also dealt with by the visitors, despite a few nervy moments."
72',substitution,"; Sunderland have made their final change of the day, with O'Shea making way for Donald Love."
71',assist,"Assist Adnan Januzaj ; Januzaj has looked slightly suspect when defending, but he's certainly been Sunderland's most dangerous player when attacking. He showed that in the build-up goal, as his wonderful skill made Defoe's goal possible."
71',goal,"Goal Jermain Defoe ; GOAL! Sunderland have pulled one back! Januzaj weaves down the left wing on a great run as he comfortably beats two Burnley players.

64',action,"Van Aanholt twists and turns as he weaves his way through the middle of the pitch before trying to tee up Januzaj depe down the left wing, but the full-back completely scuffs his pass forward and ends up sending the ball trickling harmlessly out for a throw-in."

60',action,"Van Aanholt sprints down the left wing and picks up the ball in a pocket of space before fizzing a pass across the face of goal, but his run forward wa slightly mistimed and the linesman's flag is raised as soon as Defoe scuffs his close-range shot."

Barnes picks up the ball on the edge of the penalty area and quickly tees up Gray, who skips past both O'Shea and Djilobodji before firing another great strike under the body of Mannone and into the back of the net. Sunderland have completely fallen apart!"

51',goal,"Goal Andre Gray ; GOAL! It's 2-0 to Burnley! Once again, Djilobodji's positioning is poor and allows Gray to fly past him far too easily. The striker then heads into the penalty area and quickly rounds Mannone before slotting the ball into the back of the net to double the home side's lead."
50',action,"Gray beautifully brings down the ball deep down the right wing before cutting inside and trying to pick out Boyd, who had made a good run into the penalty area. The striker's pass is slightly overhit, however, and can only find the hands of Mannone."

,action,"It's been a miserable opening 45 minutes for David Moyes, who not only finds his side a goal down but has had to deal with two injuries and a suspension. Sunderland started the game well and looked bright during the opening few minutes, but they've struggled since then and firmly find themselves on the back foot. Burnley have impressed when pushing forward, with both Barnes and Gray causing plenty of problems for the Black Cats' back line, and, thanks to a goal from the latter, they deservedly lead at the break."

37',action,"Barnes causes problems for Sunderland once again, and this time it's Larsson who fouls the striker and gives away a free-kick. It's thumped forward by Heaton and towards Gray inside the Sunderland box, but Djilobodji is there to head the ball away from danger."

21',action,"Sunderland, who have been on the back foot for the last 10 minutes, are finally able to break forward quickly after a half-hearted Burnley attack comes to an end.

19',action,"Oh dear! Lowton breaks down the right wing and cuts inside quickly before setting up Dean Marney in a pocket of space, but the midfielder's attempted long-range strike is woefully hit and ends up bouncing out of play for a throw-in over on the left flank."
17',action,"Sunderland are caught short at the back and allow Gray to fly forward on a great run. The striker skips into the right-hand side of the box after easily beating Papy Djilobodji, but he's unable to hit the target from a tight angle and instead sends his shot into the side-netting."
16',action,"Barnes deliberately handles the ball on the halfway line and gives away a free-kick to the visitors. It's taken quickly and worked short to Januzaj, who twists and turns through a sea of claret shirts before trying to set up Anichebe. His chipped pass is underhit, however, and can only find Keane."

6',action,"Stephen Ward embarks down the left flank on a marauding run before cutting inside and picking out Andre Gray. The striker is in a good position on the edge of the Sunderland box and quickly pulls the trigger, but his half-volleyed strike is far too powerful and fails to hit the target."

2',action,"Early chance for Adnan Januzaj! Fabio Borini beautifully brings down a thumping goal-kick from Vito Mannone before muscling his way towards the Burnley penalty area.

The goalkeeper has arguably been his side’s most impressive performer so far this season, and his absence could cause them problems over the coming weeks."
,action,"As for Sunderland, they have shown positive signs over the past two months and will be desperately looking to leave with a win that will result in them ending the year outside of the relegation zone. Bournemouth, Hull City, Leicester City and Watford have all lost against the Black Cats in recent weeks, leaving them just two points behind fellow strugglers Crystal Palace."
,action,"The victory against Middlesbrough was their fourth in five Premier League home games, with only Manchester City managing to leave with a narrow win during that time. Turf Moor has certainly proven to be a tough ground to visit this season, with Burnley avoiding defeat in seven of the 10 games played there."
,action,"Despite losing five of their last seven league games, Burnley head into this afternoon’s clash in a respectable 14th place, six points clear of the relegation zone and with the opportunity to move as high as 10th if results go their way. Thanks to Monday’s hard-fought win at home to Middlesbrough, they’ll certainly feel confident about their chances of making that a reality."
