,action,"Chelsea extend their winning run in the Premier League to 11 matches. That's the first time they've done that in one season. A remarkable record which was earned by Diego Costa scoring the only goal of the game just before the break with a clinical header, guiding Cesar Azpilicueta's cross beyond Wayne Hennessey."

85',action,"HANDBALL! Fabregas turns into the box to collect Costa's knockdown, but as he volleys at goal the referee blows his whistle for handball. Hennessey saved his low effort anyway."

67',action,"CHANCE! Fabregas and Moses link up down the right flank and it allows the wing-back to send a dangerous cross into the box for Costa. Delaney just gets there ahead of the forward, but his clearance is met by Alonso at the back post, who just drive his volley into the side-netting."

47',action,"CHANCE! A mis-communication between Cahill and Luiz almost allows the ball to break for Zaha, but the England man nods it away. However, it lands only as far as Cabaye who hammers his strike at goal from distance, forcing Courtois into a good low stop."
