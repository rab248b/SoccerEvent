,action,"FULL-TIME! Milan miss the chance to gain ground on third-placed Napoli in Serie A, as early goals from Insigne and Callejon are enough to resign the Rossoneri to a 2-1 defeat. Kucka snatched a goal to make things interesting, with Donnarumma testing Reina at the death with a close-range header, but the come-back proved too much. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+4',action,"Milan are the team on the offensive in the dying stages, with Napoli happy to put a lot of players behind the ball. Suso slips a pass into Lapadula, who sees an attempted cross blocked, before Strinic scrambles the rebound away."
90'+2',action,"Lapadula is released in behind the hosts' defensive line, but the Italian striker was caught narrowly offside in the build-up. Fortunately for Napoli, the flag was up, as Tonelli came across and arguably fouled the Milan substitute."
90'+1',action,We're into five minutes of stoppage time.
90',action,"Paletta is picked out by a long ball floated in from the left-hand side, but the Italian defender can only power a header some way over the crossbar. Reina was very confident that his attempt wasn't threatening to creep into the top corner."
88',action,"Napoli are happy to take their time over any dead balls, as it is clear that the visitors are in a rather precarious situation. Zielinski scampers forward, before trying to slip a pass into Mertens, but places it too far ahead of the target. His team-mate goes berserk, as Milan now have possession back."
86',substitution,"; Allan is the next man to be taken off for Napoli, with Marko Rog given the chance to work hard for the last five minutes or so."
86',substitution,"; Niang comes into the game, with Pasalic replaced, as Montella throws caution to the wind. Milan need a goal, and fast."
84',action,"Milan work the ball down the left-hand side nicely, with Bertolacci bursting into the penalty area, but Tonelli uses his strength well to stand up to the ex-Genoa midfielder and defuse the situation. Narrowly over five minutes are left on the clock, and clear-cut chances have dried up."
82',yellow-card,"Yellow Card José María Callejón Bueno ; Callejon gets a yellow card for dissent, after chasing the referee and shouting in his face. The Spaniard was clearly fouled by Calabria, but the official didn't spot it. Tempers are rising!"
81',action,"Milan earn themselves a free-kick on the right-hand side, with Paletta nodding the ball into the danger area as a result, but the away side clear their lines easily - with a handful of Rossoneri players in offside positions anyway. Lapadula is also penalised for jumping with his arm raised again Allan."
79',action,"Napoli are plugging up the gaps in their midfield well, with Diawara covering as many blades of grass as he can. Mertens and Insigne are being left up top, with the rest of Sarri's side working back and playing quite conservatively."
77',action,"Napoli earn themselves a free-kick on the left-hand side, as Gomez is penalised once again. The away side take it short, as they aren't prepared to play risky percentage football given the current scoreline and situation. Narrowly over 10 minutes remain for Milan to turn this one around."
76',action,"Paletta almost makes a mistake, which Mertens tries to pounce on, but the Milan defender does just enough to scramble the ball clear. Milan have switch to more of a flat midfield five, with Lapadula working alone up top."
74',substitution,"; Hamsik jogs off for Sarri's side, with Zielinski given the chance to freshen up the midfield, after an exhausting 70 minutes of playing on the counter."
74',substitution,"; Sosa is also replaced for Milan, with the cautioned midfielder replaced by Bertolacci for the last 15 minutes or so at San Siro."
73',substitution,"; Bacca takes his leave, after a fairly frustrating night for the Colombian striker, with Lapadula given the chance to make himself a hero once again."
73',action,"Milan earn a corner on the left-hand side, but Kucka is beaten to the ball aerially and the hosts get another chance to deliver from a second set-piece. It is taken short, with Sosa whipped a cross into the area, but Albiol heads away. Napoli respond with a break, with Mertens found in the box by Hamsik, but Bonaventura tracks back to make a vital tackle."
71',action,"Bonaventura finds Calabria on the overlap, but a cross from the left-back is cleared easily by Tonelli. Moments later, Strinic is the target, as Milan try and lift a lofted pass down their right, but the Croatia international is equal to it. The Rossoneri maintain their pressure, but a cross from Abate is blocked."
69',action,"Napoli race forward, with Hamsik trying to stab a pass into the clear for Mertens to chase! The Belgium international gets into the box with some close control, before opening his body up to find the bottom corner, but Donnarumma reads it well and dives low to his left to deny the visitors."
67',action,"Narrowly over 20 minutes remain for Milan to try and claw themselves back level, but this game is incredibly open. A long ball over the topfinds Callejon, who tries to curl a cute cross to the back post for Insigne, but Donnarumma races off his line to beat the pass away from the danger zone with a big right fist."
65',action,"Sosa tries to slip a pass into Bacca, but the Colombian takes a poor touch which enables Diawara to get goal-side. The Milan striker is then penalised for fouling the substitute. This is really end-to-end stuff, Napoli are pouncing on any opportunity to hurtle upfield at pace."
63',action,"Milan win a corner on the right-hand side, but Reina is able to come off his line easily and gobble the ball up. The Spaniard takes his time over his kick, drawing the ire of the home fans, as Napoli need to try and somehow slow the Rossoneri momentum. Allan scampers down the right flank for the visitors, before finding Mertens in the box, but a cross from the Belgian is cleared by Abate."
61',substitution,"; Diawara is the first man to be injected into the fray by Sarri, with Jorginho replaced having previously made a high-profile mistake. That should freshen up the visiting midfield considerably."
61',action,"Suso chops inside from the right-hand side, but the Spaniard can only shoot a long way wide of the target. It sails over the crossbar, with Reina having his angles covered easily there. Milan are right in this game, and one mistake from the visitors could lead to an equaliser."
59',action,"So close for Insigne! The Italy international takes aim from long range, after spotting Donnarumma a long way off his line, but the diminutive forward can only dip a speculative effort onto the roof of the net. Nearly a wonderful goal."
56',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Carlos Arturo Bacca Ahumada ; Bacca drives into the penalty area, before taking a tumble, with Albiol bearing down on him - just as Tonelli had in the first half. This time, however, the referee views it as a dive from the Colombian, and books him."
53',action,"Milan break down the right-hand side, with Abate supporting the attack, but Reina is perfectly happy to watch a cross from the flank sail straight out of play without a problem. This second half could swing either way, and the home fans can sense it. They're making plenty of noise."
51',yellow-card,Yellow Card Gustavo Raúl Gómez Portillo ; Gomez picks up a booking for flying into a tackle late on the right-hand side of the Milan defence.
50',action,"This game is incredibly open, with neither team able to definitively grab the contest by the scruff of the neck and dominate. Both teams are ideally counter-attacking entities, meaning that they are both taking full advantage of any opportunities to burst forwards."
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half! Milan need at least two goals to stand a chance of closing the gap on third place in Serie A, but Napoli have been lethal on the counter-attack this evening. Plenty of entertainment is still in store."
,action,"HALF-TIME! The referee draws an end to a breathless first half at San Siro, with Milan pushing to try and get back on level terms. Insigne and Callejon put Napoli 2-0 up early on, before a goal from Kucka turned the momentum of the game around entirely. This game could go either way after a 15-minute interval!"
45'+1',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Lorenzo Tonelli ; Tonelli is given a yellow card, with the centre-back penalised for leaning on Bacca as the Colombia international tried to break into the Napoli penaty box. While the hosts protest for a red, the visitors claim that the Milan striker was making a meal of the challenge."
45'+1',action,There is one minute of first-half stoppage time.
45',action,"Insigne is found out on the left-hand side, and slots a pass infield, with Jorginho then opening play out to the right. He gets the ball back and shoots from range, but the Italy international's effort is blocked easily."
43',action,"Calabria and Bonaventura try and combine down the left-hand side, but the former fails to offer a final ball. Napoli are happy to retain possession and slow things down as the clock ticks down to half-time, with Sarri needing to let his players regroup as quickly as possible."
41',action,"We're into the last five minutes of the first half at San Siro, and this contest has been turned on its head. Milan are rushing forward, trying to press and cause problems whenever possible, with Napoli looking far less assured at the back. The away side try to counter, with Jorginho switching the ball out to the left, but a back-post cross then evades Callejon."
39',action,"Napoli are now the team who will want the half-time break to swing around rather quickly, as Milan are suddenly brimming with confidence. The home fans are getting firmly behind their team and urging them on - they can smell blood."
38',yellow-card,Yellow Card Ivan Strinić ; Strinic is the next man in the book during what has been a fiercely competitive first half. The Croatian full-back shoves Suso to the ground cynically.
37',goal,"Goal Juraj Kucka ; GOOOOOOOOAL! KUCKA MAKES IT 2-1! The hosts are back in the game. The Slovakia international helps a high press for Milan, with Jorginho giving possession away. The midfielder scampers into the box, before prodding a good finish beyond Reina."
37',action,"Napoli are insisting on playing out from the back calmly, but the Rossoneri are starting to push on and cause some problems of their own. Montella's side are pressing and harrying, causing some confusion of their own. Bacca is released in behind by a neat pass from Suso, but the ex-Sevilla forward is caught offside when facing up to Reina."
35',action,"WIDE FROM GOMEZ! Abate tries to link up with Bacca once again, but the Italian full-back's final ball has been poor so far. In the next attack, the centre-back is picked out by a looping cross from the left, but he glances a long way beyond the far post!"
33',action,"Suso finds Abate overlapping down the right-hand side, with the Italy international attempting to race forward and drill a cross into Bacca. Albiol, however, is present at the near post to slice the low cross away from the danger zone. At last, Montella's men are looking a little threatening."
31',action,"The opening half an hour have seen Milan blown out of the water, with Reina contrastingly only needing to gather up a couple of easy crosses. Montella will want the half-time interval to come around as quickly as possible, as only one fleeting attack has shown the potential to cause Napoli any harm."
30',action,"Big chance for Napoli! Callejon manages to beat Calabria, before finding Allan, but a ball then played into Mertens somehow doesn't end up in the goal required to make it 3-0. He has his head in his hands, as Donnarumma makes a simple save from a shot that went straight down his throat."
28',action,"A few fouls have broken up the flow of play, with Tonelli and Strinic both guilty of poorly timed tackles in recent minutes. Milan try to work the ball out to the right-hand side, through Bonaventura, but Abate's cross is deflected into Reina's grateful arms."
26',yellow-card,"Yellow Card José Ernesto Sosa ; Sosa sees yellow for a late tackle on Allan, with the Argentine getting precisely none of the ball."
26',action,"Napoli keep the ball in composed fashion, with the away side controlling play with ease. Abate tries to break down the right-hand side for Milan, but the experienced full-back is quickly robbed of possession. The visitors counter, forcing Sosa to make a cynical tackle."
24',action,"Napoli look to have this Milan side figured out, as Reina has had precisely nothing to do through the opening 20 minutes or so. The Spanish goalkeeper has used his feet a couple of times, but otherwise he has been entirely untested."
22',yellow-card,Yellow Card Davide Calabria ; Calabria sees yellow for clipping Callejon's heels and coming through the back of the Napoli winger.
22',action,"Callejon is causing all kinds of problems down the right-hand side, with the home side struggling to deal with the pace and ferocity of Napoli's surges forward. a few desperate fouls are being made as a result, with Calabria guilty of coming through the back of his man more than once."
20',action,"Tonelli makes a mistake and gifts the ball away to Bacca, but the Colombian striker takes an awful first touch. Napoli try to counter immediately, but Calabria slides in to prevent the Partenopei's attack from turning into a four-versus-one situation."
19',action,"Milan open the ball out to the left nicely, but are quickly forced long by Napoli's pressing. Insigne hares forward to close down Paletta, who promptly hoofs the ball into the stands. Sarri's men are playing to their game-plan perfectly."
17',action,"Milan are seeing more of the ball, but the hosts are doing precisely nothing with it. Their back four have all of the time in the world to make their way upfield, with Napoli focusing on pressuring the second ball instead. Bonaventura crosses into Bacca, but a poor touch bounces out to Calabria, who accidentally fouls Hamsik."
15',action,"Callejon goes down heavily after colliding with Donnarumma, pointing to his ankle as the source of his discomfort. After some lengthy treatment, however, the Spain international is able to get up and play on."
14',action,"Napoli are looking comfortable, with their front three wreaking havoc on a Milan back four which is missing Romagnoli and De Sciglio dearly. The home side look shellshocked, they're struggling to recover from that quick double-salvo from the visitors. Mertens slips Callejon in behind, but Donnarumma races out to make a good stop."
12',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Dries Mertens ; Insigne rockets down the left-hand side, before checking onto his right foot and dipping a delivery into the area. Mertens goes down while challenging for it in the air, and gets booked for diving - that looked harsh."
11',action,"Bonaventura shapes to shoot, and then hesitates, with Milan struggling to create anything. Suso tries to whip in a cross from the right, but Albiol rises well in defence to head clear. The home fans don't sound happy at all, their team have started with a whimper tonight."
9',assist,"Assist Dries Mertens ; Mertens has two assists to his name already, pulling the strings as the central figure of Napoli's attack."
9',goal,"Goal José María Callejón Bueno ; GOOOOOOOOAL! WHAT A FINISH FROM CALLEJON! Mertens feeds a pass into the Spaniard, who manages to tuck the ball home from a very tight angle indeed. He is near the right byline, but Donnarumma is still beaten at his near post. Milan are 2-0 behind inside the opening 10 minutes!"
8',action,"Not the start that Montella would have been hoping for! A few mistakes have already crept into the Rossoneri's game, and Insigne has made them pay. Sarri's men are always trying to break with pace and intent, and the home defence weren't able to compete with their approach."
6',assist,Assist Dries Mertens ; Mertens picks out his teammate with a searching no-look pass from the right flank.
6',goal,"Goal Lorenzo Insigne ; GOOOOOOOOOAL! INSIGNE MAKES IT 1-0! Donnarumma might be disappointed there. Napoli counter through just a few passes, wiht Insigne picked out on the edge of the opposition box brilliantly by Mertens. He thumps a left-footed effort inside the far post, despite the goalkeeper getting a hand to it."
5',action,"Neither side are prepared to go haring after the ball, with both sides' wingers dropping back into a five-man midfield when out of possession. Neither team want to risk making an early mistake. No chances have been created as of yet, due to a lack of adventure."
3',action,"It is a quick start in Milan, with both teams prepared to fizz the ball around at pace while retaining possession. Hamsik is released in behind the hosts' back four, and passes into Mertens' feet, but the referee isn't interested when the Belgian takes a tumble. He was claiming a trip from Paletta."
1',action,"We are underway in the first half at San Siro! Napoli are in the better form heading into this game, but Vincenzo Montella's men know that a victory would keep them right in the race for Champions League football."
