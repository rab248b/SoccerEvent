,action,"FULL-TIME! Real Madrid maintain their lead at the top of LaLiga for another week, courtesy of a 3-0 win over Alaves. Benzema opened the scoring, before late strikes from Isco and Nacho made things look much more comfortable than they actually were for Los Blancos. Zidane will be pleased to get three points, but that wasn't a convincing performance at all. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+2',action,"Close from Ely! The Alaves centre-back is picked out by a free-kick delivery from deep, but the Brazilian can only guide a header inches shy of the post. That will have given Casilla a scare."
90'+1',action,There are three minutes of stoppage time at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu.
90',action,"Suddenly, Real Madrid are looking in control and are searching for a fourth goal. Somehow, Alaves have gone from chasing an equaliser to trying not to lose by an embarrassing scoreline. Once again, Zidane's men stand up to be counted when it matters most."
88',goal,"Goal José Ignacio Fernández Iglesias. GOOOOOOOOOAL! NACHO MAKES IT 3-0! Bale thunders a free-kick onto the underside of the crossbar, with Pacheco unable to react to the dip and swerve of the ball. The Real Madrid defender is first to react and nods home a close-range poacher's effort."
87',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Manuel Alejandro García Sánchez. Manu Garcia gets a yellow card for clipping the heels of Carvajal on the edge of the penalty area. The Alaves midfielder is fuming, claiming that it was accidental."
85',assist,Assist Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro. Ronaldo slides a neat pass into the penalty area and Isco finishes it off.
85',goal,"Goal Francisco Román Alarcón Suárez. GOOOOOOOOOAL! ISCO MAKES IT 2-0! Kovacic lets fly from about 25 yards out, but the Croatia international's shot is easily caught by Pacheco. Theo bursts down the left and cuts inside, but Isco dispossesses him and the hosts break. He ends up finishing the move he started, as he scampers into the penalty area and thumps home a wonderful finish."
84',action,"Into the side netting! Bale is picked out at the back post by a clipped cross, but the Wales international can only slide in to stab a finish just shy of the upright. That is potentially the best chance that Real Madrid have created since the restart."
83',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Víctor Camarasa Ferrando sub-in Christian Robert Santos Kwasniewski . Christian Santos comes into the fray for Camarasa, as Pellegrino brings on another striker and rolls the dice."
83',action,"Pepe covers across to lash a loose ball away from Deyverson, with Real Madrid needing to defend from a lot of direct passes. Toquero digs out a cross from the right, but Casilla makes a brilliant catch. The visitors are continuing to press very high upfield indeed, but it is leaving gaps at the back."
81',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Karim Benzema sub-in Lucas Vázquez Iglesias . Bale and Ronaldo are offering quick bursts forward to try and kill off this game, but Pacheco still hasn't had a great deal to do in this second half. Benzema is replaced by Lucas Vazquez for the last 10 minutes, as Zidane tries to solidify his midfield."
79',action,"Carvajal tracks back to concede a corner on the left-hand side for Real Madrid, but the visitors can't make anything of the set-piece opportunity. With narrowly over 10 minutes to go, the underdogs still have a very good chance to take a share of the spoils."
77',action,"Zidane's men keep the ball well for an extended period, with the hosts trying to just slow things down and stop Alaves' momentum. Ronaldo is found on the edge of the penalty area, but he can only slice a shot wide of the target while off-balance."
75',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Edgar Antonio Méndez Ortega sub-in Aleksandar Katai . Edgar takes his leave after a wasteful performance, with Katai given a chance to make a difference."
74',action,"Danilo is picked out making a bursting run into the Alaves penalty area, with a cut-back from the Brazilian finding Ronaldo. The Portugal international tries to shoot, but sees his attempt well-blocked. Real Madrid need to grow in confidence and fight fire with fire here. One goal from Los Blancos kills this game off."
72',action,"Camarasa has the chance to slide Edgar into the penalty area, but the Spain U21 midfielder gets his angles all wrong. Real Madrid are on the ropes a little bit here, Alaves are growing with their belief and their gameplan is setting them up for a grandstand finish. The home fans will be a little uneasy."
70',action,"Casilla makes a simple save, after a stroked shot from the left by Edgar, with the Alaves wide man spurning all of his side's good opportunities in this second half. The away side are really putting the pressure on well. Manu Garcia is picked out by a free-kick from deep, but he can only head a looping effort shy of the far upright."
69',substitution,Substitution sub-out Ibai Gómez Pérez sub-in Óscar David Romero Villamayor . Ibai is replaced by Oscar Romero for the last 20 minutes.
68',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Luka Modrić sub-in Mateo Kovačić . Modric takes his leave for the home side, with Kovacic replacing his compatriot in central midfield."
67',action,"Toquero plays a great ball down the line for Edgar, finding his teammate in plenty of space in the Real Madrid box, but again the winger has no end product. Alaves just keep growing in confidence. Deyverson is picked out by a cross from the right, but the lone striker can only head high and wide of the target."
65',action,"Less than half an hour remains for Real Madrid to see out, but they won't be feeling too secure at present. A couple of changes from Pellegrino could freshen things up and really make this an interesting contest. The hosts are content to slow things down in possession to try and discourage Alaves."
63',action,"Zidane will be concerned about how his side have started this second half, as Alaves are looking likely to get on the scoresheet before the final whistle. Edgar will be kicking himself. Real Madrid are seeing more of the ball, but Pacheco isn't being given much to do."
61',action,"What a chance for Edgar! The Alaves winger is picked out at the back post in acres of space, but the Spaniard guides a first-time volley shy of the far upright. That really should have been a goal for the away side and they may well come to rue that."
59',action,"Zidane's men need a second goal to kill this game off, with Ronaldo looking in the mood for one himself. The hosts find Carvajal on the right-hand side, but Alaves' back five is proving to be tough to crack. Real Madrid rely on their full-backs to offer creativity in the final third, but they are getting a lot of attention."
57',action,"Alaves threaten down the right, with Toquero beating his man and curling in an inviting cross. Deyverson meets it with his head once again, but the Brazilian directs the ball shy of the far post once again. Narrowly over half an hour remains for a comeback from the visitors, and they have been dangerous at times in this second half."
55',action,"OFFSIDE! Ronaldo is fed into the clear, cuts inside a covering defender and smashes a great finish into the top-right corner, but the linesman's flag denies him. Alaves respond with a quick break down the left, but a cross is caught easily by Casilla."
54',action,"Ronaldo bursts down the left-hand side and feeds a pass infield, but a switch from Isco is cut out. Theo races down the flank at real pace, beating Carvajal all ends up, with the Real Madrid right-back forced to shoulder barge his opponent. The Alaves left-back is causing havoc."
52',action,"Bale is picked out by a long ball over the top, but Pacheco races out and claims. There is then a bit of a break in play, as Danilo goes down with a head injury. The Brazil international looks to be a little bit worse for wear, with Zidane now sweating on the fitness of another of his defenders."
50',action,"Alaves earn themselves a corner on the right-hand side, but Danilo does just enough to scramble the ball away, with the visitors doing very well in the early stages of this second half. Real Madrid respond with an attempted counter down the right, but Theo does well to outmuscle Carvajal."
48',action,"Toquero tries to bend in a cross from the right, but Casilla can't claim it! The ex-Espanyol goalkeeper snatches at it under pressure from Manu Garcia, with the Real Madrid players claiming that he was impeded. Fortunately for them, Deyverson directs the loose ball over the crossbar!"
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu! Real Madrid have a narrow lead, but they need a second goal to really kill this contest off."
,action,"HALF-TIME! Real Madrid go into the interval with a 1-0 lead over Alaves, given to them by Benzema. The hosts have had more of the ball and have created the better of the opportunities, but Zidane's men aren't out of the woods yet. The Basque visitors still pose a threat on the counter."
45',action,"Danilo drives to the left byline and cuts a great ball back to Bale, who stabs a low finish wide of the far post. Feddal catches the ankle of the Welshman very badly indeed and that looks to be a sore one. Fortunately, he is quickly back to his feet."
44',action,"Modric dances into the penalty area and tries to cut a pass back from the byline, but the Croatia international is penalised for handball while trying to escape from the clutches of Manu Garcia. The Real Madrid midfielder is very fortunate to not get a booking for that."
42',action,"Ronaldo is picked out in the penalty area by a neat pass out to the right, but Theo and Feddal double up on the Portuguese striker to ensure that he can't shoot from a tight angle and test Pacheco. The Alaves goalkeeper has still only had to make one save of note this afternoon."
41',action,"Edgar is again the target of a quick break from the away side, but Casilla anticipates the situation well and cushions a neat pass out to Danilo at left-back. Less than five minutes remain until the interval and Real Madrid will need to be responsible to not be caught cold on the counter."
40',action,"Casilla races off his line to deal with yet another long ball over the top, with Ibai denied a chance to bring the pass down in behind Real Madrid's back four. There is definitely still an opportunity for Alaves to hurt Los Blancos on the counter."
38',action,"Theo feeds Ibai out to the left-hand side, before an outside-of-the-boot cross from the latter narrowly evades good connection from Deyverson. The Brazilian gets across his man well, but can only glance a header wide of the far post. That was a good chance."
36',action,"Alaves give away a free-kick on the periphery of their own penalty area, with Ronaldo having a chance to shoot from 25 yards. The Portuguese forward shoots, but the ball cannons off the wall and behind for a corner. The resulting set piece is curled in by Kroos and Laguardia does just enough to flick a header away."
34',action,"Danilo gets to the left byline, before beating Laguardia once, but the Alaves centre-back recovers well. Real Madrid open the ball out to the right-hand side, but a looping cross from Carvajal is put behind for a corner. Isco whips it in, but Pacheco punches clear well."
33',action,"Real Madrid's pressure has finally told, with Benzema grabbing yet another important goal for Los Blancos. Alaves try to respond immediately with a quick break, but Camarasa is initially denied by a good interception, before a cross from the right-hand side is headed clear by Pepe."
31',assist,Assist Daniel Carvajal Ramos. Carvajal gets to the byline well before picking out his teammate brilliantly.
31',goal,"Goal Karim Benzema. GOOOOOOOOOAL! BENZEMA MAKES IT 1-0! Real Madrid open the ball out to the left-hand side, with Toquero clearly being targetted. Benzema feeds Carvajal to the right byline, before the substitute cuts back a neat pass. The French striker rattles home a wonderful finish from 15 yards out, it arrows into the bottom-left corner!"
29',action,"Toquero is the obvious weak link defensively for Alaves, with the make-shift wing-back being isolated and then beaten all ends up with regularity. Pellegrino might have to look at changing things. Edgar tries to lead a break for the visitors, but Danilo makes a cynical challenge to halt the move."
28',action,"Good play from Ronaldo! The Portugal international is released down the left-hand side and skips beyond Toquero easily, before cutting onto his right foot. He shoots low, aiming to squeeze a finish inside the near post, but Pacheco makes a very easy save with the aid of a deflection."
26',action,"Isco tries to shoot from just inside the box, after checking back inside his man well, but he bends an effort a long way wide of the far post. Alaves haven't really put together too many dangerous passages of play, with Deyverson cutting a lone figure up top at present. The introduction of Carvajal hasn't affected Real Madrid detrimentally."
24',action,"Theo cuts inside from the left and tries to stab a low throughball into Deyverson's path, but the Frenchman gets his angles wrong. Danilo plays Bale to the left byline, but Toquero slides in to deny the ex-Tottenham winger. Zidane's men are seeing more of the ball, but they are being limited to non-threatening zones of the pitch."
22',action,"Modric gives away a free-kick for an accidental handball, gifting Alaves the chance to load the penalty area with bodies. Theo bends in a delivery, but Casilla comes off his line to punch clear. The second ball into the area is cleared by the first man. The visitors need to make the most of dead-ball situations."
20',action,"The home side are enjoying more possession, but thus far Pacheco has been given nothing to do. Alaves' back five is doing a good job in limiting Real Madrid to shots from range. Toquero is easily beaten by Danilo, with the Brazilian cutting a pass back to Carvajal on the edge of the area. The right-back blasts a first-time effort high and wide."
18',action,"Bale tries a knuckle-ball free-kick attempt from a tight angle on the right-hand side, but the Wales international can only dip a terrible effort beyond the back post. Alaves respond with a quick ball over the top, but Casilla is alert again and lashes a clearance away."
17',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Rodrigo Ely. Ely gets a yellow card for the away side, after Feddal played him into trouble. His teammate was robbed by Ronaldo, with the Milan loanee forced to cynically bring down the Portuguese forward."
16',action,"Pepe makes an important intervention inside the Real Madrid box, after a free-kick was whipped in from the left flank. Casilla manages to pounce on the second ball. Alaves are definitely carrying a threat on the counter, but the hosts do the same. Benzema is found in space on the edge of the area, but he shoots high and wide of the target!"
14',action,"Edgar goes down in the penalty area claiming a foul, but the referee isn't interested. There didn't appear to be any real contact from Danilo or Nacho there. The hosts respond with an attack down the left, with play eventually worked out to Modric. He dribbles infield, but Laguardia steps out to dispossess him."
12',action,"Camarasa is picked out at the near post by a cross from the left-hand side, but the on-loan Levante midfielder's header is deflected behind for a corner. The set piece is guided in towards the same upright, but Nacho flicks a header away. Even start in Madrid."
11',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Raphaël Varane sub-in Daniel Carvajal Ramos . Varane wanders off with an injury, with Carvajal introduced. Danilo switches to left-back."
11',action,"Casilla makes a simple save low to his right, after an ambitious long-range effort from Edgar. It appears that Varane is feeling an injury problem, with Carvajal being readied on the touchline for Real Madrid."
9',action,"Nacho drives forwards and tries to feed a low pass into Benzema, but Manu Garcia makes an easy interception. Neither goalkeeper has been given a save to make in the early stages, as these two feel themselves out. Toquero flights a cross towards Ibai, but Danilo heads clear."
7',action,"Alaves are looking to ease their way into this game, courtesy of their five-man defence offering them considerable foundations. Danilo flicks a long pass away that was aimed towards Deyverson, with the ex-Porto defender keen to get involved so far. Whenever he is afforded space to burst into, he is making the runs and offering plenty of width."
5',action,"Casilla is off his line quickly to hoof a through ball away from Ibai, before Real Madrid counter. Benzema gets into the box and tries to cut a pass back to Bale, but an interception denies the Welshman. Bright stuff from Los Blancos immediately, they're keen to take the game to their opposition."
4',action,"Benzema bursts forward and plays a neat one-two with Ronaldo on the edge of the box, before Toquero covers across to make a good tackle on the Frenchman. Real Madrid maintain their early pressure, with Zidane's men trying to play with tempo and intent. Danilo dips in a cross from the right byline, but again Toquero is there to clear."
2',action,"Ronaldo is fed into a pocket of space, after Modric did well to dispossess Manu Garcia, but the Portugal international blazes over from 25 yards out. It will be interesting to see how Alaves keep the ball without key man Marcos Llorente. Camarasa has a big void to fill in a deeper area of the pitch that he would usually feature in."
1',action,"We are underway in the first half in the Spanish capital! Real Madrid have rotated their personnel and have a tough test to face in the form of a plucky Alaves outfit. Zidane's men can't afford to drop any points, putting the pressure firmly on them."
,action,"Alaves substitutes: Raul Garcia, Alexis, Santos, Oscar Romero, Ortola, Torres, Katai."
,action,"Alaves starting line-up (5-4-1): Pacheco; Toquero, Laguardia, Ely, Feddal, Theo; Edgar, Camarasa, Manu Garcia, Ibai; Deyverson."

,action,"Real Madrid starting line-up (4-3-3): Kiko Casilla; Danilo, Varane, Pepe, Nacho; Modric, Kroos, Isco; Bale, Benzema, Ronaldo."
,action,"TEAM NEWS: Alaves' Marcos Llorente is ineligible to play against his parent club, meaning that Victor Camarasa drops deeper in midfield. Edgar and Ibai Gomez will support Deyverson, with Rodrigo Ely, Victor Laguardia and Zouhair Feddal making up a back three. It appears that the visitors could be prepared to change to a five-man defence for this game. Theo Hernandez is back in at left-back, Gaizka Toquero could fill in on the opposite flank, potentially."
,action,"TEAM NEWS: Kiko Casilla comes in between the sticks for Real Madrid, with Danilo and Nacho rotating in at full-back. International duty has counted Zidane's South American players out of this one, meaning that the likes of James Rodriguez and Marcelo are absent. Casemiro sits out with a ban. Pepe partners Raphael Varane in the heart of the defence, with Kroos playing in a holding midfield role. Isco features, with the usual BBC installed up front."
,action,"Alaves come into this game unbeaten in their last three, and recently took points off third-place Sevilla. Mauricio Pellegrino has already masterminded a win at Camp Nou earlier this season and has navigated his side to the final of the Copa del Rey, but a trip to Estadio Santiago Bernabeu is about their toughest test of the campaign yet."
,action,"Hello and welcome to live coverage of Real Madrid's home game against Alaves, as Zinedine Zidane's men look to keep their momentum going in LaLiga. The hosts are two points clear of Barcelona with a game in hand, and have the title in their grasp heading into El Clasico later this month. They can't afford to slip up, but their opposition are tough customers."
