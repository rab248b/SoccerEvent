,action,"A Gonzalo Higuain brace and Paulo Dybala penalty see the Bianconeri cruise past Roberto Donadoni's side, as they set the all-time record with 26 consecutive home wins in Serie A."
90'+2',action,FULL-TIME: JUVENTUS 3-0 BOLOGNA.
90',action,There will be two minutes added on at the end of this match.
88',substitution,Substitution sub-out Federico Di Francesco sub-in Anthony Mounier . The final change of the match sees Bologna bring sub-in Anthony Mounier on for Di Francesco.
87',action,"Much of the same here as Juventus refuse to relinquish possession or push up the pitch. Bologna are cooperating, mostly to ensure they don't concede a fourth, it would seem, but their compliance is making for some difficult viewing from a neutral standpoint."
85',action,STAT: Juventus have lost just one of their last 27 Serie A clashes with Bologna (W17 D9) and have conceded only one goal over the last five matches against the Rossoblu.
83',action,"Juventus have snatched back control as they patiently pass it around amongst themselves near the halfway line, looking to milk the final minutes off the clock. It's been a tedious last 30 minutes in Turin and that's set to continue for a little while longer."
81',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Sami Khedira sub-in Tomás Eduardo Rincón Hernández . Juventus' final change sees the club debut of midfielder Tomas Rincon, who replaces Khedira."
79',action,"It's all fizzling out here as we approach the last 10 minutes. The life has been sucked out of the match and there's little tempo to speak of now. Bologna continue to spend a lot of time on the ball, but are creating precious little."
77',action,"SHOULD BE FOUR! Sturaro surges forward on the break and appears to be clean through on goal, but he opts to try and pass across for Mandzukic, rather inexplicably, as the chance goes begging. He had a clean sight at goal there and for some reason passed it up."
75',action,"STAT: Bologna have used 27 players over the current Serie A campaign, more than any other team."
73',substitution,Substitution sub-out Gonzalo Gerardo Higuaín sub-in Mario Mandžukić . Wholesale changes from both sides as the fourth in three minutes sees Mario Mandzukic replace Higuain.
71',substitution,Substitution sub-out Ladislav Krejčí sub-in Luca Rizzo . sub-in Luca Rizzo comes on at the expense of Krejci in the other switch.
71',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Blerim Džemaili sub-in Erick Antonio Pulgar Farfán . Bologna make a pair of changes as we enter the final 20 minutes, the first of which sees Erick Pulgar replace Dzemaili."
70',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Miralem Pjanić sub-in Juan Guillermo Cuadrado Bello . Juan Cuadrado is the first player brought on by either side, replacing Pjanic."
68',action,"Bologna are enjoying plenty of possession in this second half, and over the last 10 minutes especially. That will skew the possession stats a bit at full-time, but it can all be attributed to Juventus pulling ahead by three goals inside of an hour. They can afford to sit back here."
66',action,"Good defensive play from Viviani to slow Dybala on the break, but Juventus still manage to get the ball forward. Higuain pulls a pass back into the danger area, but Maietta gets back in the nick of time to intercept the pass and bundle it behind for a corner."
64',action,"Torosidis is walking a fine line as he's penalised for another foul for getting a hand into the face of Sturaro. The Bologna full-back can't afford to be so reckless, already on a yellow."
62',action,"STAT: Bologna won their last away game against Pescara, ending a run of 14 consecutive Serie A away matches in which they failed to win (D7 L7)."
60',action,"The visitors are enjoying more time on the ball here as Juventus afford them the time to pass it around in midfield. The bulk of their possession here is coming on the fringes, however, as they struggle to negotiate a way through this stubborn Bianconeri defence."
58',action,"Bologna have not given up the fight, continuing to go in search of a consolation goal. Juventus have taken their foot off the gas a bit, and are starting to keep more bodies behind the ball as they try and keep the clean sheet intact for Neto."
56',action,"There doesn't appear to be any way back for Bologna, who haven't played bad by any means, they just ran into a Juventus side who were angry after losing to Milan in the Super Cup."
54',assist,"Assist Stephan Lichtsteiner. Terrific cross from Lichtsteiner, floated over the reach of both defender and keeper, and perfectly onto the head of Higuain."
54',goal,"Goal Gonzalo Gerardo Higuaín. THAT'S THREE! And two for Higuain, who couldn't miss the header this time as he gets on the end of a perfectly floated in cross from Lichsteiner, bouncing an effort beyond a scrambling Mirante. That should do it."
52',action,"STAT: Juventus have been leading for the most minutes (692) in Serie A this season. That number is at 737 and counting, including this match."
50',action,"What looked a bad one for Dybala winds up being much ado about nothing as he pops back up a minute later and play resumes. He stays out there, looking no worse for wear, as Juventus settle things down in possession."
48',action,"Uh oh. Nasty looking injury here for Dybala. He tries a stepover and his plant foot slides out. He immediately goes to ground, clutching his groin, in obvious pain. Juventus cannot afford to lose him. For his sake and theirs, hopefully it's nothing serious."
46',action,Back underway in Turin as Bologna get the second half started...
,action,"Gonzalo Higuain put Juventus ahead inside of 10 minutes and their lead doubled just before the break through a Paulo Dybala penalty, after Stefano Sturaro was fouled - albeit a bit softly - just inside the box. Nonetheless, it's a comfortable and deserved lead for the hosts, who are on course for a winning start to 2017."
45'+1',action,HALF-TIME: JUVENTUS 2-0 BOLOGNA.
45'+1',yellow-card,Yellow Card Federico Di Francesco. Di Francesco is issued a yellow card for a late foul.
45',action,There will be one minute added on at the end of this first half.
43',action,STAT: Juventus are one win away of setting the all-time record of 26 consecutive home wins in Serie A: the current run started against Bologna in October 2015.
41',penalty-goal,Penalty Goal Paulo Bruno Dybala. COOL AS YOU'D LIKE! Dybala sends Mirante the wrong way as he confidently converts the spot-kick to put Juve 2-0 up! That might be enough for them...
39',action,"PENALTY! Bit of a soft call, but by the book that's a foul. Oikonomou and Sturaro get tied up as the Juve midfielder makes a strong run into the area, and he's deemed to have been fouled by the centre-half, as the referee points straight to the spot."
37',action,"GREAT TACKLE! Higuain does well to steal back possession high up the pitch and run in one-on-one against Maietta, but the centre-half does really well to stand his ground, putting in a strong challenge to snuff out the danger."
35',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Vassilis Torosidis. Torosidis becomes the first Bologna player booked on the night as he slides in with a a reckless, and somewhat violent, challenge on Sturaro."
33',action,"Juventus have struggled to get their rhythm back, but are starting to up the intensity once again. They're pushing the tempo and sending bodies forward in search of a second, seemingly awoken by Bologna's spell of prominence."
31',action,"STAT: Juventus collected 100 points in 2016, winning 33 games – at least five more than any other side over the top-5 European leagues."
29',action,"Bologna have responded brilliantly to falling behind. They've shut up shop defensively and are looking increasingly threatening on the break as they start to enjoy more possession, too. They're getting into some good areas, and are not lacking in support, but their passing at the vital moment has let them down."
27',action,"Di Francesco has been a real bright spot for Bologna in this first half. His seemingly bottomless tank has given the Juventus defenders fits, and he's become the focal point of every Bologna counter. He just needs to pick out a better final ball, but everything else is there."
25',action,"WHY NOT! Marchisio lets fly from range, connecting sweetly with a strike from 25 yards. It's just a bit too central in the end, however, and Mirante is able to get the slightest of touches to turn it over the bar."
23',action,"Juventus have grown a bit complacent here and Bologna's eager legs are taking advantage. The visitors are doing an excellent job of getting pressure on the ball, and Juventus aren't doing well enough to cope at the moment."
21',action,STAT: Gonzalo Higuain has scored the most goals in the opening 15 minutes of play in Serie A this season (4).
19',action,"Neto is called into action for the first time, but it's more of a routine save for him as he collects a rather tame effort from Di Francesco, who had done well to run and the defence and cut into space on his right. He doesn't get the desired accuracy behind his strike in the end, however, as Juventus maintain their lead."
17',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Stephan Lichtsteiner. Lichtsteiner goes into the back of Di Francesco with the ball in the air, and gets a stray arm into the back of the head. There's no escaping a booking there for the right-back."
15',action,"INCHES WIDE! One-way traffic here in Turin as Juventus get forward with regularity. Lichtsteiner and Khedira link-up smartly on the right, and the latter plays a wonderfully inviting cross in for Higuain, who places his header just beyond the far post with the keeper rooted!"
13',action,"Juventus survived a brief injury scare as Higuain went down and required a bit of attention, but he's back out there with his teammates as they continue to attack at will. The ball falls kindly for Lichtsteiner following a corner, but he's unable to react quickly enough to turn it in at the far post."
11',action,STAT: Juventus have won each of their last three Serie A home games against Bologna and have failed to score only once in their last 20 meetings with the Emiliani on the home soil.
9',action,"Bologna awarded a quick chance to responded from a dead-ball situation following a Sturaro foul. Bodies crowd the referee who winds up showing leniency in keeping the yellow card in his pocket, before Viviani strikes the free-kick straight into the wall. You can't be squandering opportunities like that against the leaders."
7',assist,Assist Miralem Pjanić. Outstanding vision and precision with that ball over the top from Pjanic to provide the assist.
7',goal,"Goal Gonzalo Gerardo Higuaín. DELICIOUS GOAL AND JUVENTUS LEAD INSIDE 10 MINUTES! It's a superb first-time finish from Higuain on the volley, that just squeezed under the arm of Mirante, but it was all made possible by an absolutely inch-perfect ball over the top from Pjanic to play him through."
5',action,"Bologna pride themselves on their defensive stability, but this will be the ultimate test for them this evening against the league leaders and one of Serie A's most prolific attacking outfits. Through five minutes they've come under some pressure, but have remained well-organised."
3',action,"Early dominance from Juventus, as expected, with Bologna doing just enough to keep them out. The visitors win the ball back and break quickly, and Lichtsteiner is put under a lot of pressure by Di Francesco before awkwardly slicing the ball clear. Real end-to-end stuff in the opening stages."
1',action,"AND THEY'RE OFF! Juventus get the game underway in their famous black and white stripes, attacking left to right, with Bologna in bright (almost blinding) yellow."
,action,"Roberto Donadoni has made three changes to his side, with Marios Oikonomou brought into defence, Godfred Donsah coming into midfield and Federico Di Francesco handed a start in attack, at the expense of Daniele Gastaldello, Adam Nagy and Anthony Mounier."
,action,"Juventus make three changes to their side from their last league match of 2016, a 1-0 win over Roma. Andrea Barzagli is brought back in to partner Giorgio Chiellini at centre-half, with Daniele Rugani dropped to the bench. Kwadwo Asamoah plays left-back ahead of Alex Sandro. New signing Tomas Rincon has been named among the substitutes."
,action,"SUBS: Nagy, Floccari, M'baye, Pulgar, Krafth, Rizzo, Okwonkwo, Helander, Da Costa, Mounier, Gastaldello, Ferrari."

,action,CONFIRMED TEAM NEWS:
