,action,FULL-TIME: PESCARA 0-2 JUVENTUS
90'+4',action,"Zampano is fouled over on the right flank once again and wins another free-kick for the home side. It fails to result in a chance on goal though, as Rugani is pushed to the ground as the two sets of players battle for the ball."
90'+2',action,"Pescara are enjoying a good spell of possession at the moment but, as has been the case for much of the afternoon, they're struggling to do much with the ball. It's been a very easy game for Juventus, who, despite offering little up front since the break, have looked comfortable throughout."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be four minutes of added time.
89',action,"Higuain steps up and strikes the ball well, but there's slightly too much power behind his shot and it ends up looping a few yards over the top of the crossbar."
88',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Andrea Coda. Mandzukic picks up the ball midway inside the Pescara half of the pitch and immediately charges towards the penalty area, where he's clumsily tripped over by Coda and wins a free-kick for the visitors in a very dangerous position."
87',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Juan Guillermo Cuadrado Bello sub-in Mario Lemina . Juventus have made a late alteration, with Cuadrado making way for sub-in Mario Lemina."
86',action,"Almost a chance for Caprari! The forward makes a clever run into the Juventus penalty area and almost manages to latch on to the ball in front of goal, but he's beaten to it by Neto at the vital moment and is unable to get a shot away from close range."
85',action,"Zampano is caught by Mandzukic as he tries to dart into the Juventus penalty area, and Pescara are awarded a free-kick just a yard or so outside of the box on the right wing. A low shot is fired towards goal from the set-piece, but it's easily dealt with by Neto in the middle of the goal."
83',action,"An attempted Pescara attacking move breaks down, allowing Juventus to counter through the middle of the pitch through Cuadrado. The Colombian does well to reach the box before threading a pass through to Higuain, but it's cut out before it can find the Argentine in front of goal."

79',action,"Space opens up in the middle of the pitch and allows Pescara to break away on a quick counter-attack. They initially do so well thanks to good play by Memushaj, but he's dispossessed from behind by Sturaro before he can penetrate the penalty area."

74',action,"Marchisio sends a clever pass down the right wing and into the path of Lichtsteiner. The full-back meets it well and then fires an even better cross into the box, but there's nobody there to meet it, much to his frustration."
72',action,"Juventus lose the ball in the middle of the pitch, allowing Pescara to try and break quickly. Brugman's unable to set up a team-mate with a swift pass forward, however, as it's easily closed down on the halfway line."
70',action,"Pescara battle their way down the right wing and do well to win themselves a free-kick in a very promising position. It's swung into the penalty area and bounces around dangerously, but Juventus are just about able to blast the ball away."

65',action,"Biraghi, who has been pushing further forward since the break, does well to skip into the left-hand side of the Juventus penalty are before trying to pick out Brugman, but his low cross is slightly mishit and trickles into the hands of Neto."

62',action,"Coulibaly is caught from behind by Mandzukic as he tries to spin round the Croatian, resulting in a free-kick for Pescara in a promising position.

60',action,"Big chance for Sturaro! Cuadrado lifts a lovely chipped pass over the Pescara defence and into the path of Sturaro, who had made a great run into the box. The substitute meets it well and then shoots, but his low effort is tame and can't find its way past Fiorillo."
59',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Gianluca Caprari. Caprari reacts angrily after conceding a throw-in over on the left wing and throws the ball away, leaving the referee with no choice but to show him a yellow card for dissent."

52',action,"Juventus lose the ball midway inside their own half of the pitch and allow Pescara to push forward on a rare attack. They're unable to make it count, however, as Coulibaly's low cross bounces just past Bruno on the left-hand side of the box."
50',action,"Another hefty challenge from a Pescara player! This time it's Mandzukic who's caught by a clumsy tackle from Coulibaly, but, again, the referee ignores the Juventus players' pleas for a card and keeps them in his pocket."
48',action,"Big call by the referee! Muntari brings Dybala crashing to the ground with a reckless challenge that leaves the Argentine in a heap on the floor.

,action,"Despite not being at the best for the opening 20 minutes, it's been a relatively comfortable game for Juventus so far, and they deservedly head into the break with a two-goal lead. It's one that means they'll be able to take their foot off the pedal slightly after the break, as Pescara have really struggled to cause any problems whatsoever for Neto."

42',action,"Asamoah causes further problems over on the left wing before dragged to the ground by Memushaj, leaving the referee with no choice but to award a free-kick to Juventus. Dybala steps up and whips a great cross into the penalty area, but it's well dealt with by the home side."
40',action,"A wonderful, curling cross from Cuadrado sails into the Pescara box and over to the far post, where it finds Mandzukic. The Croatian can't make decent contact with the ball though, and he ends up sending his downward header over the top of the crossbar."

36',action,"A dangerous chipped cross from Lichtsteiner sails into the Pescara box and looks set to find Dybala in a pocket of space in front of goal, but Muntari flings his body in front of the ball and heads it away from the Argentine at the vital moment."

30',action,"Higuain goes down inside the box, but nothing is given! The striker breaks into the Pescara penalty area and tries to out-muscle Hugo Campagnaro before throwing himself to the ground, but the referee isn't at all interested and tells him to get back to his feet."

20',action,"A poor pass from Higuain can only find Ledian Memushaj, who then breaks forward quickly. The home side work the ball around well before Zampano fires a clever cross into the heart of the box, but Rugani is just about able to blast it away from danger."

16',action,"Higuain picks up the ball just outside of the Pescara penalty area and tries to shoot, but he holds on to possession for slightly too long and is dispossessed.

,action,"A win against the Old Lady is something that Pescara haven’t achieved in their history, with Juventus comfortably winning on each occasion. November’s meeting in Turin resulted in a 3-0 victory for the home side thanks to goals from Sami Khedira, Mario Mandzukic and the now departed Hernanes, whilst the last meeting on this ground ended in a 6-1 thrashing for the home side."
,action,"It’s been a season to forget for Pescara, who have struggled all campaign and are on the brink of being sent straight back down to Serie B. They’ve looked slightly better in recent weeks thanks to the return of Zdenek Zeman and did well to hold both Milan and Empoli to 1-1 draws, but it’ll still take a monumental effort from the Dolphins to beat such an in-form Juventus side."
,action,"In the league, the previous few weeks have gone smoothly for Juventus, who easily beat Chievo last weekend after being held to a draw by third-place Napoli. It’s now exactly two months since the Old Lady last tasted defeat in Serie A, with 10 of their 12 games since then ending in wins for the reigning champions, who can surely smell another league title coming their way."
,action,"Things are going splendidly for Juventus on all fronts at the moment, as not only do they currently sit six points clear at the top of the table, but Tuesday’s 3-0 win at home to Barcelona means that they have one foot in the semi-finals of the Champions League. They now must take on a Pescara side that are as good as relegated, and nothing less than a comfortable victory will be tolerated by Massimiliano Allegri."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Serie A game between Pescara and Juventus at the Stadio Adriatico.
