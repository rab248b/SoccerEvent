,action,"It’s finished all square at St Mary’s with neither side able to find a way through. Bournemouth undoubtedly had the best of the chances, with Benik Afobe squandering a golden opportunity before Harry Arter fired a penalty high over the bar. Southampton dominated possession for large parts of the game, but as has been the case for much of their season, they struggled to create too many meaningful opportunities, and in the end were lucky to escape with a point. That’s all from us for today, thanks for joining us and we hope you’ll be able to join us again soon."
,action,Full-time: Southampton 0-0 Bournemouth
90'+3',action,"Smith curls the free-kick high over the bar, and that could well be the last chance either side has in this game."
90'+2',yellow-card,Yellow Card Oriol Romeu Vidal. Fraser is brought down by Romeu just outside the Southampton penalty area and the midfielder is shown the first yellow card of the game. This could be one last chance for Bournemouth too.
90'+1',action,"We’re into the first of three minutes of added time, with neither side throwing too many bodies forward now."
89',action,"Save!! Arter looks to make up for the penalty miss as he picks up the ball in acres of space 25 yards out from goal and hits a fierce, left-footed effort towards goal, but Forster springs to his left and palms the ball away from danger. It was at a lovely height for him in truth."
80',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Dušan Tadić sub-in Sam McQueen . Another change for Southampton, and perhaps a sign that they're settling for a point now as Tadić is replaced by sub-in Sam McQueen."
79',action,"Wilshere went on a driving run forward and looked to slip the ball into Fraser ahead of him, but the winger was pulled back by Bertrand and referee Moss pointed to the spot. Arter though could not take advantage."
79',missed-penalty,"Missed Penalty Harry Arter. OVER THE BAR!!!! Arter blasts the penalty high over the bar, taking a huge chunk of turf up as he does so."
78',action,PENALTY TO BOURNEMOUTH!!
76',action,"It looks as though Wilshere is playing just in behind Afobe and as a result Bournemouth are looking far more dangerous than they did in the first half, when Afobe and King looked somewhat isolated playing alongside each other."
74',action,"Bournemouth suddenly look the more likely of the two sides to score and Pugh has another good opportunity as Daniels’s cross deflects straight to him 12 yards out from goal, but this time Southampton throw bodies in the way and Yoshida blocks his low, right-footed shot before it reaches Forster."
72',action,"OFF THE POST!!! Somehow Bournemouth don’t score as Smith’s low drive from 20 yards crashes against the foot of the post before falling at the feet of Pugh seven yards out from goal, but the winger takes a touch instead of hitting it first time and Forster is able to get quickly off his line to smother the shot before Southampton scramble the ball away."
70',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Joshua King sub-in Jack Wilshere . Another change for Bournemouth and perhaps a sign that Eddie Howe would settle for a point now, as sub-in Jack Wilshere comes on in place of King."
69',action,"Chance!! Another chance for Southampton as Long gets goal side of Cook inside the right-hand edge of the penalty box having been played in by Tadic, but from a tight angle he can only lift his delicate chip across the face of goal and out for a goal kick."
67',action,Half-hearted appeals for a penalty from the Southampton fans as Boufal drives into the penalty box from the left before being ushered out of play by Fraser. There wasn’t a lot in it in truth but it’s certainly a good start from the substitute.
65',action,The Bournemouth fans are trying to give their side a lift now by getting making themselves heard. It doesn’t appear to be having a huge effect though as Southampton are still dominating possession.
63',substitution,Substitution sub-out Jay Rodriguez sub-in Shane Long . And it's going to be a double change for Southampton as Rodriguez is replaced by sub-in Shane Long.
63',substitution,Substitution sub-out James Ward-Prowse sub-in Sofiane Boufal . And that will be Ward-Prowse's last action as he's replaced by sub-in Sofiane Boufal.
62',action,A half-chance for Southampton as Ward-Prowse side-foots wide of the far post from the right-hand side of the penalty box after Boruc had failed to deal with Redmond’s well struck effort from 25 yards out.
61',action,"WHAT A CHANCE FOR AFOBE!!! King wins the ball from Yoshida and breaks forward with only Stephens ahead of him, before rolling the ball across to his strike partner who only has Forster to beat from 12 yards out, but takes an age to get the shot away before eventually sliding it wide of the left-hand post."
58',action,"Bournemouth are sitting incredibly deep now, with all 11 men inside their own half as Southampton knock the ball around at the back under very little pressure. Bournemouth seem quite happy to absorb the pressure though with Southampton struggling to create any clear-cut openings."
56',action,"Southampton are certainly looking to get the ball out to the right-hand side whenever they can, this time Cedric looks to play the ball over the top of Daniels for Ward-Prowse to chase, but the right-back is stretching as he plays the ball and subsequently over hits the pass."
54',action,"Cedric picks out Davis on the right-hand touchline and having cut inside onto his left foot the Southampton captain plays a neat reverse ball into the box towards Rodriguez, but not for the first time today the flag goes up against the striker."
52',action,"It’s been a relatively quiet start to the second half so far with both sides looking a little cagey, although Bournemouth are certainly seeing more of the ball than they did at the end of the first half."
50',action,Redmond goes on a superb run into the Bournemouth half before attempting an ambitious cross-field pass towards Tadic which is easily intercepted by Smith. Claude Puel will be keen to see more of that from Redmond though as he looks dangerous with the ball at his feet.
48',action,"Afobe looks to get in behind the Southampton defence but Stephens tracks back well and knocks the ball back to his goalkeeper, albeit at some pace making it difficult for Forster to deal with, but he gets enough on the clearing kick to get it away from danger."
46',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Andrew Surman sub-in Harry Arter . sub-in Harry Arter, who was actually stripped and ready to go before the second half started, is now coming on just seconds into the half in place of Surman, who did take a knock in the first half."
46',action,Kick-off! King gets the second half underway for Bournemouth.
,action,"Claude Puel will be hoping his side can start the second half the way they finished the first, when they had a couple of good opportunities to open the scoring, while Eddie Howe will be hoping Bournemouth can get the ball into the feet of King and Afobe more often after the break, with the two strikers having had very little opportunity to run at the Southampton defence so far."
,action,"No goals at the break at St Mary’s, but Southampton have certainly come close on a number of occasions, forcing Boruc into several smart saves in the Bournemouth goal as well as hitting the post. Bournemouth struggled to get into the game for the majority of the half, but did have an effort cleared off the line just after the half hour mark."
,action,Half-time: Southampton 0-0 Bournemouth
45'+1',action,We’re into two minutes of added time now and Southampton look extremely dangerous all of a sudden.
44',action,"CLOSE!! Two chances in a matter of seconds for Southampton as Maya Yoshida heads a Tadic corner over the bar from just six yards out, despite being completely unmarked, before Boruc is forced into palming Rodriguez’s powerful first-time shot over the bar. Southampton don’t look as though they want half-time to come now as they’ve just got the momentum back in their favour."
42',action,Stephens is now down receiving treatment having been clattered by his own goalkeeper Forster as he came off his line to collect a loose ball. The centre-half looks to be in some discomfort but he’s going to carry on for now with half-time just a couple of minutes away.
40',action,"Another half-chance for Bournemouth as the ball falls to Afobe 12 yards out from goal after a good run forward from Charlie Daniels from left-back, but the striker rushes his shot on the turn and scuffs it straight into Stephens."
38',action,"OFF THE POST!! Southampton work the ball really well through Ward-Prowse and Cedric down the right before the full-back cuts a low cross back towards the edge of the penalty box where Tadic is arriving late, but having taken a touch his left-footed shot just grazes the outside of the post, with Boruc rooted to the spot."
35',action,"It looks as though Surman has taken a knock in the process of attacking that ball, but it looks as though he’s going to be able to continue although Jack Wilshere is out warming up just in case."
33',action,"OFF THE LINE!! Southampton fail to deal with the initial ball from the corner and Andrew Surman looks to poke it past Forster from the edge of the six yard box, and despite failing to get a good connection with the ball it still finds its way past the Southampton keeper, but the slow pace of the ball allows Steven Davis to hack it clear off the line."
32',action,"King is penalised for throwing Cedric Soares to the ground as the pair battle for possession before winning a free-kick himself moments later after stealing possession back from Ward-Prowse. Fraser swings in the cross from the free-kick out wide on the left-hand side, but Stephens gets up well to head the ball out for a corner."
29',action,"Eddie Howe is patrolling the edge of his technical area barking instructions to his team, but he’ll be relatively happy with his side who’ve certainly grown into this game in the last 10 minutes."
27',action,The intensity of this game has dropped significantly in the last few minutes after a good start for Southampton. That will suit Bournemouth though who now have their first shot of the game as Gosling fires well over the bar from 25 yards out after Fraser Forster’s punch clear dropped straight to him.
25',action,"The crowd, who have been relatively quiet so far, finally come to life with some ironic cheers as referee Jonathon Moss gives Southampton a corner just moments after awarding Bournemouth a goal kick when the ball looked to have gone out off a Bournemouth player."
23',action,"A chance for Josh King to use his pace now as he gets down the outside of Jack Stephens on the left-hand side and looks to cut inside the centre-back and get into a shooting position, but Stephens stays with the in-form striker well and makes a good tackle on the edge of the box to cut out the danger."
21',action,"Redmond breaks forward at pace and looks to play a through ball into the path of Ward-Prowse on the right-hand side, but he’s clipped by Marc Pugh as he attempts the pass and Southampton are awarded a free-kick just inside the Bournemouth half. Ward-Prowse looks to pick out Oriol Romeu from the free-kick but Boruc comes off his line well to claim it."
19',action,"Josh King and Benik Afobe are looking pretty isolated up front for Bournemouth at the minute, with the midfield four sitting deep and Southampton hardly letting them get out of their own half."
17',action,"Tadic and Rodriguez are involved in almost everything going forward for Southampton at the moment, this time the former plays the ball into the feet of the latter, who cuts inside onto his right foot and hits a powerful effort towards goal from the left-hand corner of the penalty box, but it’s too close to Boruc who catches it with relative ease."
15',action,"Disallowed goal!! Bertrand plays an early low cross into the path of Rodriguez who finds the back of the net on the second attempt having been initially denied by Artur Boruc, but the linesman’s flag is up for offside and the goal will not count."
13',action,"Rodriguez breaks away down the right-had side after a smart ball from Tadic and he has an unmarked Redmond in support at the back post, but the striker fails to get his head up and Dan Gosling gets back to make a good tackle, which deflects back off Rodriguez and out for a goal kick."
11',action,"Bournemouth are really struggling to keep the ball at the moment, and although Southampton haven’t created any clear cut opportunities thus far, Eddie Howe will be eager for his side to get more of a foothold in this game."
9',action,"Another half-chance for Tadic as Rodriguez flicks the ball down the right-hand edge of the Bournemouth penalty and the midfielder shows a good turn of pace to get on the end of it, but he can only fire his low right-footed shot across the face of goal from a tight angle."
7',action,"Lovely play from Redmond to skip away from Ryan Fraser, but his pass forward, which was intended for Ryan Bertrand to chase, is easily dealt with by Adam Smith down the Bournemouth right as Bertrand drops off anticipating a pass into his feet."
5',action,A really bright start for Southampton here as James Ward-Prowse’s cross from the right is missed completely by Jay Rodriguez 10 yards out from goal. It looked as though he was caught in two minds as to how to attack that ball and ended up doing nothing at all with it.
4',action,"A half-chance for Dusan Tadic as Steven Cook and Simon Francis both follow Nathan Redmond’s run leaving the midfielder with acres of space to shoot from just outside the penalty area, but he blasts it high over the bar."
2',action,Southampton are seeing plenty of the ball early on but most of it is inside their own half with Bournemouth not looking to press too high.
1',action,Kick-off! Southampton get the game underway.
,action,"Referee Jonathon Moss leads the players out onto the pitch, kick-off is not far away now."
,action,"Jay Rodriguez scored twice as Southampton came from behind to secure a 3-1 win at the Vitality Stadium when the two sides met earlier in the season, with Ryan Bertrand also getting on the scoresheet for Claude Puel's side."
,action,"Bournemouth are unchanged from the side that saw off Swansea, but Harry Arter and Junior Stanislas are both included on the bench having missed that game through injury."
,action,"Claude Puel makes just one change to his Southampton side that was beaten by Spurs, with Jay Rodriguez starting up front in place of Manolo Gabbiadini who misses out with a groin injury. Martin Caceres could make his Southampton debut having been included on the bench."
,action,"Subs: Allsop, Cargill, Smith, Arter, Ibe, Wilshere, Stanislas"
,action,"Bournemouth (4-4-2): Boruc; Smith, Francis, Cook, Daniels; Fraser, Surman, Gosling, Pugh; King, Afobe"
,action,"Subs: Hassen, Caceres, McQueen, Clasie, Hojbjerg, Boufal, Long"
,action,"Team news: Southampton (4-2-3-1): Forster; Cedric, Stephens, Yoshida, Bertrand; Davis, Romeu; Ward-Prowse, Tadic, Redmond; Rodriguez"
,action,"That run earned Eddie Howe the Premier League manager of the month award and moved Bournemouth comfortably clear of the relegation zone, after a dreadful start to 2017 saw them go seven games without a win."
,action,"Bournemouth meanwhile enjoyed an extremely successful month of March, with a creditable 1-1 draw against Manchester United followed by wins over West Ham United and Swansea."
,action,"They do though come into the game having lost seven of their last 10 Premier League matches, including a 2-1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in their last outing, and will be looking to bounce back after an international break which saw James Ward-Prowse and Nathan Redmond make their England debuts."
,action,"The two sides are level on points in the table, although Southampton are ahead on goal difference and do have two games in hand over their south coast rivals."
