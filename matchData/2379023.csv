,action,"United's defence of their FA Cup crown has started with an easy win, and it's certainly a well-deserved one. Straight from the start, they were comfortably on the front foot and caused plenty of problems for Reading, who, at both ends of the pitch, failed to muster up enough of a challenge to trouble an impressive United side."
,action,FULL-TIME: MANCHESTER UNITED 4-0 READING
90'+2',action,"With 92 minutes on the clock, Reading are finally able to test Romero with their first shot on target, but Obita's 30-yard effort fails to beat the Argentine and is instead easily saved in the middle of the United goal."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be two minutes of added time.
88',action,"McCleary and Gunter link up well deep down the right flank before the latter skips past Blind before being cynically tripped over by the Dutchman, resulting in a free-kick for Reading in a dangerous position. Kelly steps up and curls a cross over to Moore, but the defender is unable to hit the target with his close-range header."
86',action,"McCleary, who has arguably been one of Reading's better players during the second half, gets himself into a good position deep down the left wing before trying to pick out a teammate with a low pass into the penalty area, but he's unable to do so and United easily hold on."
84',action,"Fellaini goes close! The corner fails to result in a chance on goal but allows Rooney to dart into the penalty area and set up Fallaini, but the Belgian is unable to beat Al-Habsi from close range and sees his toe-poked effort pushed away by the goalkeeper."
83',action,"United almost make it 5-0! Martial flies into the left-hand side of the Reading box before trying to poke a pass back to Rooney, but the visitors' back line are just about to deal with the danger as the ball dangerously pinballs around the penalty area and out for a corner."

79',goal,"Goal Marcus Rashford. GOAL! What a howler from Al-Habsi! The goalkeeper receives the ball inside his penalty area and is quickly closed down by Rashford, who forces the Oman international into completely fluffing his attempted clearance and gifting the young striker with one of the easiest goals he'll ever score."
78',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Juan Manuel Mata Garc√≠a sub-in Bastian Schweinsteiger . And the second is sub-in Bastian Schweinsteiger, who receives a rousing round of applause from the home fans as he replaces Mata."
78',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Michael Carrick sub-in Timothy Fosu-Mensah . United have decided to make a double substitution. The first player to come on is sub-in Timothy Fosu-Mensah, who takes the place of Carrick."

77',action,"Swift bursts forward on a promising run as he tries to get Reading back into the game, but his long-range strike isn't hit well enough to test Romero and instead bounces several yards wide of the United goal."
75',assist,"Assist Michael Carrick. Carrick showed great vision to pick out Rashford with that bouncing pass, but Moore really should have done more as he tried to cut out the danger to stop the ball from reaching the striker."
75',goal,"Goal Marcus Rashford. GOAL! It's 3-0! Carrick picks up the ball and quickly fires a long pass forward towards Rashford. It bounces past Moore and into the path of the youngster, who controls it well and heads into the penalty area before easily beating Al-Habsi with a side-footed finish."
74',action,"Rashford is dragged back as he tries to dart down the right wing, resulting in a free-kick for United that Smalling heads off a Reading player and out for a corner. Blind steps up and curls a dangerous cross into the middle of the box, but it's easily dealt with by the visitors."

60',action,"Great touch by Van den Berg! Rooney bursts into the left-hand side of the Reading box before trying to tee up Rashford with a low pass across the face of goal, but just as it looks as if the youngster is going to side-foot the ball into the back of the net, Van den Berg gets a touch on the cross to send it away from the striker."
58',action,"What a chance for Mata! Rooney is left all alone in far too much space in the middle of the pitch and quickly threads a through-ball into the path of Mata, but the Spaniard is immediately flagged offside, sparing his blushes as he fires his shot the wrong side of the near post."

They've certainly been the better of the two sides, with the Reading back line continually failing to deal with Martial, Rashford and Rooney, all of whom have been brilliant. At the other end, the visitors started to cause more problems as the half wore on, with Kelly and McCleary managing to get into the game, but so far they've failed to give Romero much to think about."
,action,HALF-TIME: MANCHESTER UNITED 2-0 READING
45'+2',action,"An attempted Reading attacking move breaks down and United hit the visitors on another quick counter-attack.

42',action,"Vital block by Evans! Young easily skips past Beerens on the right-hand side of the Reading box and then tees up Mata with a clever pass into the middle of the penalty area, but Evans is there to throw his body in the way of the Spaniard to stop him from firing in United's third goal."

31',action,"Rashford battles with Van den Berg over on the right wing before eventually losing out to the defender. The Dutchman's attempted clearance is poor and can only find Rooney on the edge of the box, and the captain then unleashes a cheeky chipped shot that sails a few yards over the top of the crossbar."
30',action,"Kelly breaks into the right-hand side of the United penalty area and latches on to a lovely lofted pass forward before fizzing the ball across the face of goal, but it's sent slightly too near to Sergio Romero, who is easily able to collect the pass before it can pick out Kermorgant."

7',goal,"Goal Wayne Rooney. GOAL! Rooney's done it! He's equalled Sir Bobby Charlton's goal-scoring record!

The striker is in a pocket of space in front of goal and comfortably manages to knee a shot past the outstretched limbs of Al-Habsi and into the back of the net."
7',assist,"Assist Juan Manuel Mata Garc√≠a. Mata did well to set up Rooney with a deft chipped pass, but questions have to be asked of the Reading defence. They haven't started at all well, with space opening up in and around the penalty area far too easily."

,action,"Jose Mourinho has decided to make nine changes to the United side that started the victory against West Ham United on Monday evening, with only Marcos Rojo and Michael Carrick retaining their places in a heavily-altered line-up."
,action,"Reading substitutes: Moore, Watson, Cooper, Meite, Obita, Samuel, Swift."

,action,"There‚Äôs just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let‚Äôs have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon‚Ä¶"
,action,"After three games out with a thigh injury, Rooney is back in the United starting line-up as he searches for that all-important 249th goal. If he hits the back of the net today, the 31-year-old striker will equal Sir Bobby Charlton‚Äôs record and become United‚Äôs joint-highest goalscorer of all time."
,action,"It‚Äôs now almost exactly 90 years since Reading last beat United in an FA Cup tie, with the Red Devils winning six of the last eight subsequent meetings between the two sides. United were also victorious in the last Premier League game between the two, with that fixture ending in a 1-0 win thanks to a first-half goal from Wayne Rooney."
,action,"Stam‚Äôs first taste of full-time management has proven to be a big success thus far, with the Dutchman managing to guide his Reading side to third place in the Championship table thanks to Monday‚Äôs spirit comeback against Bristol City. The Royals have been one of the standout teams in a very impressive division this season, and they will be quietly confident about their chances of pulling off an upset today."
,action,"United are unbeaten in their previous¬†24 FA Cup meetings against second-tier sides, with their last defeat coming against Watford in 1982. However, they will be well aware of the embarrassment they suffered at the hands of MK Dons two seasons ago, and Jaap Stam is certainly bringing an impressive Reading team with him on his return to Old Trafford."
,action,"It‚Äôs been a good two months for United, who head into today‚Äôs cup tie unbeaten in 13 games, their longest run since March 2013. The last seven of those ended in victories, setting them up perfectly for the defence of their FA Cup crown. It took until extra-time to beat Crystal Palace in May‚Äôs final, but with his United side looking far more slick than they did earlier in the season, Jose Mourinho will be hoping for an easier¬†day this afternoon."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today‚Äôs FA Cup third round game between Manchester United and Reading at Old Trafford.
