,action,"Atletico secure all three points at the Vicente Calderon with a comfortable 3-0 win over relegation threatened Osasuna, thanks to a brace of goals from Yannick Carrasco as well as one from Filipe Luis. Atletico did miss two penalties within the space of two minutes late on, but it did not prove costly against an Osasuna side who created very little and rarely threatened Jan Oblak’s goal. That's all from us for today, thanks for joining us and we hope you can join us again soon."
,action,Full-time: Atletico Madrid 3-0 Osasuna
90'+2',action,We’re into three minutes of added time now at the Vicente Calderon.
90',yellow-card,Yellow Card Miguel Ángel De las Cuevas Barberá. De las Cuevas has also been shown a yellow card for protesting at the decision.
90',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Juan Rafael Fuentes Hernández. Fuentes has been shown a yellow card for handball, which is what the second penalty was given for although it looked a little harsh."
90',missed-penalty,Missed Penalty Thomas Teye Partey. SAVED AGAIN!!!! Thomas is this time denied by another stunning save by Sirigu high to his right!!
90',action,ANOTHER PENALTY TO ATLETICO!!
89',missed-penalty,Missed Penalty Yannick Ferreira Carrasco. SAVED!!! Carrasco is denied a hat-trick by Sirigu who dives low to his right to make up for bringing down Correa.
88',yellow-card,Yellow Card Salvatore Sirigu. Sirigu is shown a yellow card for bringing down Correa after the striker had controlled a wonderful long ball forward from Tiago and looked to take the ball round the Osasuna keeper. There was defensive cover though so there was no danger of the card being red.
88',action,PENALTY TO ATHLETICO!!
87',action,"Close!! Wonderful footwork from Correa as he twice turns away from Garcia inside the penalty box before curling a low, left-footed effort narrowly wide from 10 yards out."
86',action,"Osasuna look to be pretty exhausted now and unsurprisingly so, they’ve had to do a lot of work without the ball."
83',action,"Sergio Leon, who’s hardly been involved at all for Osasuna, controls a long ball forward really well with the outside of his boot before driving down the right-hand side of the penalty box, but Savic gets across well to ease him off the ball, although the striker seems to think the challenge is worthy of a penalty."
81',action,"Osasuna go on a rare venture into the Atletico half as Berenguer drives down the right-hand side before cutting in field to look for support, but Thomas shows his strength to ease him off the ball and regain possession. The midfielder has been outstanding for Atletico so far today."
79',action,"Atletico break forward on the counter attack through Correa who feeds the ball wide to Carrasco on the left. The winger then cuts inside onto his right foot and shapes to shoot, but instead rolls the ball back into the feet of Correa who is tackled almost immediately by Oier."
77',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Fausto Antonio Tienza Nuñez sub-in Roberto Torres Morales . Osasuna are also making another substitution with Roberto Torres coming on for Tienza, who doesn't look too pleased to be going off."
76',substitution,Substitution sub-out Osvaldo Nicolás Fabián Gaitán sub-in Alessio Cerci . A third and final change for Atletico as Gaitan is replaced by sub-in Alessio Cerci.
73',action,Atletico are in total control of this game now as Thomas and Carrasco knock the ball around close to the left-hand touchline without any real attacking intent.
71',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Fernando José Torres Sanz sub-in Tiago Cardoso Mendes . Diego Simeone is making another change as Tiago comes on in place of Torres, who will be wondering quite how he hasn’t scored today, but is still given a deafening reception as he leaves the field."
69',action,"Carrasco plays a neat one-two on the edge of the box before curling an effort towards goal in search of his hat-trick, but it’s straight at Sirigu who holds on to the ball without any problems."
67',substitution,Substitution sub-out Filipe Luis Kasmirski sub-in Stefan Savić . Atletico are making another change now as Stefan Savic comes on in place of Filipe Luis who goes off to a standing ovation. That change is likely to see Lucas move across to left-back to accommodate Savic in the middle of the defence.
65',action,The tempo of this game has dropped off dramatically now with neither side showing any real intent to throw too many bodies forward with just under half an hour still to play.
63',action,"That goal should kill this game off now for Atletico, with Osasuna still yet to have a shot on goal. Diego Simeone though will feel his side are more than capable of adding to this score line."
61',assist,Assist Ángel Martín Correa. Correa could have gone for goal himself but instead chose to set up Filipe Luis.
61',goal,"Goal Filipe Luis Kasmirski. GOOOOAAAALLLLL!!!! Moments after Torres had been denied by a wonderful close-range save by Sirigu, Filipe Luis gets Atletico’s third goal, sweeping the ball right-footed into the far corner from 12 yards out after Correa had played the ball perfectly into his path."
59',action,"Correa turns away from two Osasuna defenders really well and drives towards the Osasuna penalty box, but his control just lets him down and Garcia is able to regain possession for his side."
57',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Carlos Clerc Martínez sub-in Aitor Buñuel Redrado . And it‘s going to be a double change in fact with Aitor Buñuel coming on in place of Clerc, which is likely to mean a switch to a back four for the visitors."
57',substitution,Substitution sub-out Miguel Olavide Montes sub-in Miguel Ángel De las Cuevas Barberá . A first change for Osasuna now as Olavide is replaced by Miguel De las Cuevas
54',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Oier Sanjurjo Mate. Oier is shown a yellow card for a cynical foul on Carrasco and Atletico take the free-kick quickly down the left-hand side before the ball falls to Torres on the edge of the six yard box, and the Spaniard does everything right by opening his body up and guiding the ball towards goal, but it’s straight at Sirigu who keeps it out with his legs."
53',action,"Clerc wins a free-kick for Osasuna to the left-hand side of the penalty box having been blocked off by Juanfran, although the right-back didn’t really have anywhere to go. Berenguer swings in the free-kick but it’s headed away by Atletico."
51',action,The home crowd chant Diego Simeone’s name and the Atletico boss responds with a round of applause for the fans. He’ll certainly be much happier now that his side have added a second goal.
49',action,"Atletico break forward again through Carrasco who looks to put an early cross into the middle, but he’s slightly off balance as he attempts the cross and it fails to cause Osasuna any problems as a result."
47',assist,Assist Osvaldo Nicolás Fabián Gaitán. The cross from Gaitán from the corner of the penalty box was absolutely perfect for Carrasco to head in.
47',goal,Goal Yannick Ferreira Carrasco. GOOOOAAAAALLLLLLL!!! Carrasco gets his second of the game!! Atletico have started this second half really well and they double their lead as Gaitan whips in a superb left-footed cross from the right-hand side and Carrasco peels away from Olavide at the back post and heads the ball into the corner from five yards out.
46',action,Kick-off! Carrasco gets the second half underway for Atletico.
,action,"Diego Simeone will be hoping his side can add a second goal early in the second half, and will be eager for his full-backs, Filipe Luis and Juanfran, to continue to get forward as often as possible as Atletico have caused Osasuna the most problems from wide areas. Osasuna boss Petar Vasilijevic though may well have to make a change before too long, as his side have barely troubled Oblak in the Atletico goal."
,action,"Atletico lead at the interval at the Vicente Calderon thanks to Carrasco’s 25 yard strike on the half hour mark, and they could easily have added a second when Godin headed wide from the edge of the six yard box. Osasuna meanwhile had looked well organised in defence up until the goal, but have offered very little going forward."
,action,Half-time: Atletico Madrid 1-0 Osasuna
45',action,"Osasuna have one last chance to get the ball into the Atletico area as Berenguer stands over a free-kick just to the left of centre 40 yards out, but his floated delivery is too easy for Jan Oblak who gathers it in."
43',yellow-card,Yellow Card Kenan Kodro. Atletico are awarded a free-kick for a foul in the air by Kenan who looked as though he just made contact with his elbow on Gaitain’s head as both players jumped for the ball. Kenan is subsequently shown a yellow card for the foul.
41',action,"Atletico are starting to look much more dangerous now as Carrasco is clean through on goal down the left-hand edge of the area, but he decides against shooting with his left foot and instead tries to cut back inside onto his right foot, but he’s then tackled by Alex Berenguer."
39',action,"Another chance for Atletico as Torres gets in behind the Osasuna defence down the right-hand side of the penalty box and has a chance to test Sirigu, albeit from a tight angle, but he tries to lift the ball over the keeper and gets it horribly wrong causing the ball to roll harmlessly across the face of goal and out for a goal kick."
38',action,"CHANCE!! Gaitan swings in a delightful cross from a free-kick on the left-hand side after a foul on Carrasco by Garcia and Godin gets up well to meet the cross seven yards out from goal, but he heads wide with Sirigu rooted to the spot in the middle of his goal."
36',action,"Boos ring out around the stadium as the offside flag is raised against Correa despite him appearing to be comfortably onside, with Torres, who was in an offside position, not getting involved in the play."
35',action,"Atletico show the threat they possess on the counter attack as Carrasco breaks forward at pace into the Osasuna half following a corner, but the Osasuna defence get back in numbers this time and force the Belgian winger into running the ball out of play for a throw-in."
32',action,"That goal has suddenly brought the home fans inside the Vicente Calderon to life, as they’d been unusually quiet up until now."
30',assist,Assist Filipe Luis Kasmirski. Filipe Luis played the simple pass into Carrasco who turned away from Causic extremely well before shooting.
30',goal,Goal Yannick Ferreira Carrasco. GOOOAAALLLLLLL!!! Carrasco picks the ball up 25 yards out from goal before skipping past Goran Causic with ease and drilling a low shot into the bottom left-hand corner to give Atletico the lead.
28',action,"Close!! The ball breaks to Correa after Osasuna fail to deal with a corner and the striker shoots on the turn from seven yards out, but the ball deflects into the side-netting off Olavide."
27',action,"Gaitan shows an extraordinary burst of pace to make up several yards on Juan Fuentes and get to the ball ahead of him down the right-hand side before sending a deep cross towards an unmarked Carrasco at the back post, but David Garcia just gets there first to head it clear."
25',yellow-card,"Yellow Card José María Giménez de Vargas. Thomas gives the ball away cheaply in midfield and Kenan looks to break away into the Atletico half, but he’s brought to ground by a lunging Gimenez who is shown a yellow card for the foul."
23',action,"Atletico are seeing far more of the ball now but this game really hasn’t got going yet, with Osasuna playing what is essentially a 5-4-1 formation when they don’t have the ball, preventing Atletico from finding any way through the middle."
21',action,"Carrasco cuts inside from the left-hand touchline onto his right foot before playing a crisp pass in towards Correa. The striker though lets it run through his legs in the hope it will reach Torres behind him, but Osasuna have enough men back to cut out the danger."
19',action,"Torres holds the ball up well with his back to goal and eventually gets it out to Juanfran on the right-hand side, but the right-back’s cross is straight into the arms of Sirigu, although there were no Atletico players anywhere near it anyway."
17',action,This game has started at a pretty low intensity in truth with neither side really dominating possession. Atletico have though looked the more dangerous in the final third.
15',action,"Diego Simeone looks slightly apprehensive on the touchline but Atletico come close to taking the lead as Gaitan bursts away down the right-hand side before crossing towards Angel Correa, but the striker can’t make clean contact with the ball and scuffs his effort across the face of goal from 10 yards out."
13',action,Kenan Kodro wins a free-kick as he’s given a nudge in the back by Thomas Partey just inside the Atletico half. Osasuna though chose not to play the ball forward and instead seem content to roll the ball backwards and keep possession.
11',action,Superb work from Carrasco as he wins possession back inside the Osasuna half allowing Diego Godin to spread the ball wide to Juanfran on the right-hand side. The attack comes to nothing in the end but Atletico are certainly starting to settle into this game now.
9',action,"The ball looks as though it’s running harmlessly out of play for an Osasuna goal kick but Filipe Luis does exceptionally well to get to it and keep it in play before the ball eventually finds its way to Juanfran on the edge of the box, but he slices his shot and Sirigu can watch it go comfortably wide of his goal."
7',action,Filipe Luis is brought to ground by Miguel Olavide on the left-hand touchline but the referee deems a free-kick to be sufficient. Carrasco whips in the free-kick but it’s far too high and Salvatore Sirigu catches it high above his head with ease.
5',action,"It looks as though Yannick Carrasco has started on the left with Nico Gaitan starting on the right for Atletico, but it’s likely that they’ll swap during the course of the game. It’s Osasuna who are seeing marginally more of the ball at the minute though."
3',action,Diego Simeone is already on the edge of his technical area remonstrating with the linesman as he gives a throw-in to Osasuna just in front of the dugouts. It’s been a relatively quiet opening to the game from both sides though.
1',action,Kick-off! Referee Melero Lopez blows his whistle and Osasuna get the game underway.
,action,"The players are out on the pitch, kick-off is not far away now."
,action,"Osasuna look as look as though they will play with five at the back in attempt to nullify the attacking threat of Atletico, but they will be looking for Alex Berenguer and Carlos Clerc to provide plenty of attacking intent from the wing-back positions."
,action,"Diego Simeone has chosen to leave Antoine Griezmann and Saul Niguez on the bench ahead of the Champions League quarter-final second leg against Leicester City next week, meaning Angel Correa gets the chance to start alongside Fernando Torres up front, while Jose Gimenez will partner Thomas Partey in the middle of midfield, with Gabi not included at all."
,action,"Subs: Nauzet, Vujadinovic, Bunuel, de las Cuevas, Torres, Merida, Riera"
,action,"Osasuna (5-3-2): Sirigu; Berenguer, Garcia, Oier, Fuentes, Clerc; Olavide, Causic, Tienza; Leon, Kenan"

,action,"Teams: Atletico (4-4-2): Oblak; Juanfran, Godin, Lucas, Filipe Luis; Carrasco, Gimenez, Thomas, Gaitan; Correa, Torres"
,action,"Two of those three wins have though come in their last two matches, against Alaves and Leganes, offering them an outside chance of pulling off what would be an unlikely escape."
,action,"Osasuna in contrast are bottom of the La Liga table, 10 points adrift of safety having won just three games all season, conceding 70 goals in the process."
,action,"Only Barcelona and Real Madrid have won at the Vicente Calderon in the league this season, with Espanyol and Deportivo Alaves the only other sides to have taken points off Atletico at their home stadium."
,action,"Atletico have been beaten just once in their last 15 games in all competitions, and come into the game on the back of a 1-0 win over Leicester City in their Champions League quarter-final first leg, with Antoine Griezmann scoring the only goal of the game from the penalty spot."
