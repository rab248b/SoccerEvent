,action,"As for Lazio, they impressed in the first half and were arguably the better of the two sides, but they failed to deal with Roma after the break and looked increasingly bereft of ideas in front of goal. Immobile struggled to deal with the three centre-backs diligently watching him, whilst both Anderson and Keita failed to offer enough service out wide."
,action,"The referee blows his whistle for the final time and the Roma players and fans immediately erupt with joy. They played brilliantly this afternoon and certainly deserve to leave with three hard-earned points that, once again, send them above Milan and keep them just four points behind leaders Juventus ahead of next weekend's big game against the Rossoneri."

90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be four minutes of added time.
89',action,"It's all Roma at the moment as they do well to hold on to possession deep inside the Lazio half of the pitch. They're moving the ball around nicely and are causing plenty of problems for Inzaghi's men, who haven't been anywhere near good enough during the second half."
88',action,"Almost a chance for Milinkovic-Savic! Anderson breaks down the right flank and sends a lovely through-ball into the path of Lombardi, who then cuts a pass back to Milinkovic-Savic in the middle of the penalty area, but just as he does, the linesman's flag is eventually raised for offside."
86',action,"Anderson battles his way down the right flank before being fouled by Nainggolan, resulting in a free-kick for Lazio in a very dangerous position. Kishna steps up and fires a low cross into the penalty area, but it's poorly hit and easily dealt with by Roma."

81',action,"Fantastic play by Nainggolan! The Belgian, who has been absolutely brilliant this afternoon, flies back to help out his side deep inside the Roma half of the pitch, and he does wonderfully well to win the ball back before weaving his way through a group of three Lazio players."
80',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Dušan Basta sub-in Patricio Gabarrón Gil . And the second is Patric, who takes the place of Basta."
80',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Lucas Rodrigo Biglia sub-in Cristiano Lombardi . Lazio have decided to make a double substitution as they try to find a way back into the game. The first player to come on is Lombardi, who replaces Biglia."

There are still a few players pushing and shoving one another, despite the best efforts from the referee and his assistants."
66',red-card,"Red Card Danilo Cataldi. It's all kicking off on the pitch!

,action,"With just one point currently separating the two rivals, this afternoon’s Derby della Capitale is set to be an extremely entertaining one.
