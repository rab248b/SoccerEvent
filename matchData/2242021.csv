,action,"Thanks for joining our commentary this afternoon. Until next time, goodbye."
,action,"Referee Kevin Friend was a critical figure in the contest as he did not send off Tyrone Mings, Harry Arter or Ibrahimovic, despite being solid cases for all three to be dismissed. Andrew Surman was the unlucky man that was sent off and Adam Smith was on the receiving end of a terrible penalty decision. Not a great game for the official."
,action,"Artur Boruc is the hero for the visitors as he made a number of fine stops, including a penalty save from Zlatan Ibrahimovic - who had a game to forget."
,action,"WHAT AN INCREDIBLE GAME! Bournemouth somehow secure a point from this fixture despite playing the second half with 10 men. Manchester United threw everything at the Cherries, but were unable to come away with the win."
,action,FULL-TIME: MANCHESTER UNITED 1-1 BOURNEMOUTH
90'+5',action,THAT'S IT! Bournemouth have held out for the point!

90'+3',action,"MISS! Pogba has the chance to win the game for United, but he scuffs his effort at goal, wasting a golden opportunity unmarked at the back post."
90'+3',action,"Nervy times at the back for Cargill as he misjudges his header, but he just manages to clear ahead of Mata."
90'+2',action,"Mata stabs his cross forward into the box, but the ball hits the deck and rolls away from Ibrahimovic at the vital moment."

88',substitution,Substitution sub-out Joshua King sub-in Max-Alain Gradel . Gradel replaces King for the visitors.
87',action,"Cargill remains disciplined in his play in the box, refusing to jump into his challenge with Rashford before dispossessing the United forward."
86',action,Fellaini has joined Ibrahimovic in the forward line and United are simply throwing bodies into the box and hoping for the best at this stage.
84',action,"Afobe has space to break into down the right, but his delivery is awful as he fails to even threaten to find the two team-mates that joined him in the box."
83',action,Pogba tries to do too much with his cross into the box and it allows Boruc to come off his line to claim with ease.
82',action,"Bournemouth pile men forward for a corner, but United are able to clear their lines and break down the right."

76',action,"BLOCK! From the resulting corner, Ibrahimovic collects at the back post and hammers his effort towards goal, only to see his strike blocked by Mings. The defender goes down and needs more treatment."
74',action,"WIDE! Pogba goes for goal from the edge of the box, but he pulls his effort just past the post with the aid of a deflection. A crazy match continues as United were allowed to play on despite Arter being down on the deck after a collision with the Frenchman."
72',penalty-save,Penalty save Artur Boruc. Boruc gets down low to his right to make the save. He's been brilliant this afternoon.
72',missed-penalty,"Missed Penalty Zlatan Ibrahimović. MISS! Ibrahimovic's poor display continues as he fires his effort low to the bottom corner, but Boruc makes a brilliant save to deny the Swede."

61',action,None of the 38 visiting teams that have been reduced to 10 men at Old Trafford have managed to beat Manchester United. Only eight of them have managed to take a point away from the stadium.
60',action,"Rooney attempts to time his run behind the Bournemouth defence to latch on to Shaw's pass, but he is a fraction early and is caught offside."
59',action,"Valencia bursts down the right flank and whips an early cross into the box, but it's straight down Boruc's throat."

46',action,We're back underway at Old Trafford.
,action,As the players emerge from the tunnel Mourinho lets his feelings known to Mings for his stamp on Ibrahimovic.
,action,"The referee appeared to acknowledge the incident by taking to him, but incredibly did not send the United forward off. If Bournemouth were not raging before then they were seconds later when Andrew Surman earned his second booking."
,action,The drama did not end there as first Tyrone Mings decided to step on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's head after the Swede had fallen down in the box. Referee Kevin Friend did not spot the incident. Ibra retaliated by swinging his elbow straight into the defender's face a minute later.
,action,"Somehow the scores are level at the break. Manchester United have dominated this game and took a deserved lead through Marcos Rojo, but a foul by Phil Jones on Marc Pugh allowed Josh King to equalise from the penalty spot."

45',action,There will be three minutes of added time.
45',yellow-red,Yellow/Red Andrew Surman. Incredibly Surman is the man to be sent off as he collects his second booking for his protests to Friend.
45',action,"DRAMA! A lot to cover here. First Mings steps on Ibrahimovic's head - that should be a red. From the resulting corner - Ibrahimovic retaliates with a huge swing of his elbow against Mings - that should be a red. Friend talks to the Swede, but does not send him or Mings from the field."

37',action,Ibrahimovic throws Mings to the ground off the ball and somehow escapes with only a talking to from the referee. Interesting decision.
35',action,United are dropping the tempo slightly in an attempt to gain better precision with their passing in the final third. The gaps are so huge in the Bournemouth defence there is no need to rush themselves.
33',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Andrew Surman. Surman wipes out Shaw on a surge down the left and goes into the book, despite his appeal to referee Friend."
32',action,"For all of United's dominance, somehow Bournemouth are only one goal behind. Howe would be delighted to get into the break trailing by a one-goal margin. An important 13 minutes ahead."

27',action,"Mata steers the ball into Ibrahimovic's path on the edge of the box, but a good covering tackle from Smith dispossesses the Swede before he can threaten."
25',action,More concerns for the Cherries as Cook has sustained an injury and requires treatment off the pitch.
23',assist,Assist Luis Antonio Valencia Mosquera. Valencia drives a low strike at goal and he sees his effort diverted into the net by Rojo.
23',goal,"Goal Faustino Marcos Alberto Rojo. GOALLLLL!!! ROJO PUTS UNITED AHEAD! It has been coming since the opening seconds of the game, but the Red Devils finally take the lead as Rojo diverts Valencia's strike from the edge of the box past Boruc into the bottom corner."
21',action,Smith raids forward and loses possession giving Martial acres of space to raid down the left flank. Only a good covering tackle from Cook stops another threat at goal from United.

13',yellow-card,Yellow Card Harry Arter. Arter goes into the book for a lunge on Carrick.
12',action,"SAVE! Martial collects on the left flank and cuts inside on his right foot to fire a low effort at goal, but Boruc makes a solid stop to keep the ball out."
11',action,"SLIP! Afobe breaks away from Rojo at the other end of the pitch and only has De Gea to beat, only to lose his footing at the vital moment, allowing the Spaniard to gather."
10',action,"CHANCE! Rooney robs Mings of possession and tees up Ibrahimovic to shoot inside the box, but the Swede takes an uncharacteristically poor first touch and the opening is spurned by the Red Devils."
8',action,"OFFSIDE! Mata breaks in behind once again and fires at goal, but his effort is saved by Boruc. It would not have mattered anyway had he found the net as the Spaniard was flagged offside."
6',action,"Mata raids in behind the Bournemouth defence on the right flank, but his low cross into the box is cleared away by Cook. The Cherries are looking extremely vulnerable at the back in the early stages."
5',action,"SAVE! Boruc makes a fine stop to keep the scores level as a simple ball over the top has the Cherries all over the place at the back. Pogba stabs his strike towards the bottom corner, but the keeper just gets a fingertip on the ball to send it wide."
4',action,"United are cut open at the back by a long ball and King barges Jones off the ball, with referee Friend not awarding a free-kick. However, the forward is unable to pick out a blue shirt in the box."
3',action,"A long ball over the top of the United defence has Jones struggling with Afobe. De Gea comes off his line to help his team-mate, only for the ball to strike Jones. Fortunately for United, De Gea reacts in time to stop it in its tracks."
