,action,"FULL-TIME! What a result for Real Madrid! It all appeared lost, after Joselu scored twice to put Deportivo 2-1 to the good at the Bernabeu, but late finishes from Mariano Diaz and Sergio Ramos ensure that Zidane's men maintain their six-point lead at the summit of La Liga courtesy of a 3-2 victory. What a rollercoaster that was. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time!"
90'+4',action,"Real Madrid are back ahead and are now left with the matter of seeing this result out. Deportivo win a free-kick on the left-hand side, which is lofted into the box, but Navas comes out to claim."
90'+2',assist,Assist Toni Kroos. Kroos whips in a wonderful near-post corner delivery.
90'+2',goal,"Goal Sergio Ramos García. GOOOOOOOOOAL! SERGIO RAMOS THUMPS HOME A HEADER! The Real Madrid captain rises well at the near post to guide home a good finish, in some more lata drama at the Bernabeu. Tyton gets nowhere near it. What a leap!"
90'+2',action,"Tyton gets hurt! The Poland international gets up well to palm a save over the crossbar, can collides with the post. He lands flat on his back and doesn't move, as it appears he knocked himself out for a few moments. Somehow he is carrying on."
90',action,"Real Madrid are looking incensed now, they're pushing on trying to find a goal desperately. That little scuffle has inspired a new motivation out of Zidane's men. There are five minutes of added time."
88',yellow-card,Yellow Card Sidnei Rechel da Silva Júnior. Yellow card Sidnei Rechel da Silva Júnior
88',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Keilor Navas Gamboa. Navas races from his own goal to get involved, and gets a card for his trouble."
88',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Sergio Ramos García. Ramos comes flying into the action and shunts Sidnei away from his teammate, which is worthy of a caution."
88',action,"Late drama! Alvaro Morata is again the man involved, as he tries to get Tyton to get up and carry on despite appearing to be injured. Sidnei clashes with the Spaniard, with Vazquez and Ramos hurtling into the fray too. There is plenty of pushing, but somehow the ex-Espanyol winger escapes a card."
86',action,"A change of system appears to be working for Zidane, whose three-man defence is allowing for Marcelo and Vazquez to push high upfield. Kroos opens the ball out to the right, but Deportivo then race away on the counter. Joselu is released in behind, but Navas is off his line in a flash to take it under his control."
84',assist,"Assist Lucas Vázquez Iglesias. Vazquez flights in a nice cross, which is guided home beautifully by Diaz."
84',goal,"Goal Mariano Díaz Mejía. GOOOOOOOOAL! MARIANO DIAZ MAKES IT 2-2! The substitute manages to guide a lovely header into the far corner, leaving Tyton with absolutely no chance. Real Madrid could still try to get back into the lead with five minutes or so on the clock."
83',action,"Marcelo breaks down the left-hand side and bends a low cross in from the byline, with Tyton able to gather it up at the near post. Real Madrid are going to have to show a bit more quality in the final third if they are to get back on level terms here tonight."
82',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Ryan Babel sub-in Fayçal Fajr . Fajr is given the last 10 minutes to impress, with Babel taking his leave after running himself into the ground."
81',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Danilo Luiz da Silva sub-in Marcelo Vieira da Silva Júnior . Borges almost makes a costly mistake on the edge of his own penalty area, but Tyton gobbles the ball up ahead of Morata. A break in play then allows for Marcelo to replace Danilo for the dying stages."
80',action,"Vazquez tries to split the visiting defence with a good pass, which finds Diaz, but the substitute goes down after colliding with Sidnei. No foul, says the referee. Moments later, Babel heads up the other end and goes down on the periphery of the box, but again the official is unmoved."
78',action,"The home fans are growing a little nervous, as Real Madrid's cushion at the top is in real jeopardy. Another cross is swung in from their left-hand side, but Sidnei is present this time to nod the danger away. Zidane's men need to find another gear, but I'm not sure if they have one."
76',action,"The referee will have to watch for any timewasting or cynicism from the away side now, as they're very close to a huge away result. Real Madrid are dominating possession and trying to get a dangerous move going, but Deportivo are defending their penalty area brilliantly."
75',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Florin Andone sub-in Pedro Mosquera Parada . Tyton is happy to take his time over his goal-kicks now, as Deportivo try to close out what would be a sensational three points. Garitano makes a change, with Andone replaced by Mosquera, which shows that the away side are set to shut up shop now."
72',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Francisco Román Alarcón Suárez sub-in Mariano Díaz Mejía . Isco is hauled off, with Mariano Diaz given the chance to make himself a hero as an extra striker. His first involvement sees him slide in and narrowly miss a good cross from the left from Morata."
72',action,"Andone and Joselu have been causing all kinds of issues on the break, as Garitano has been happy to leave two strikers up top to battle for long clearances forward. A deep cross from Nacho on the left-hand side looks for Morata, but Tyton is off his line quickly to claim."
70',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Álvaro Borja Morata Martín. The referee is forced to intervene in a disagreement with Morata and Albentosa, with the Real Madrid striker getting a booking for shoving the defender in the chest."
70',action,"Sidnei does well to make a clearance from deep within his own penalty area, before the Brazilian nods the ball away from the danger zone once again moments later. Nacho is found overlaps down the left-hand side, but then gives the ball away, with Andone and Joselu being left up top to cause all kinds of problems on the counter."
68',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Marco Asensio Willemsen sub-in Lucas Vázquez Iglesias . Asensio is replaced by Vazquez for the last 20 minutes or so, with Zidane giving the young winger plenty of instructions before he heads onto the pitch."
65',assist,"Assist Florin Andone. Andone races down the right-hand side and into a threatening area, before cutting a neat ball into the box."
65',goal,"Goal José Luis Sanmartín Mato. GOOOOOOOOOAL! JOSELU HAS MADE IT 2-1! Andone races down the right-hand side and slides a low pass into the penalty area, with the Spanish substitute turning and shooting from close-range. His finish wriggles in between Navas' legs and bobbles into the back of the net. A real shock is on the cards here."
63',assist,"Assist Carles Gil de Pareja Vicent. Carles Gil gets the assist for the away side, but the finish is the main talking point here!"
63',goal,"Goal José Luis Sanmartín Mato. GOOOOOOOOAL! JOSELU MAKES IT 1-1! What a strike from Joselu! The substitute takes aim from the edge of the penalty area, and thumps a fantastic effort into the top-left corner. Navas has no chance, it kisses the angle of post and bar on its way into the box. Unbelievable effort! Casemiro gave the ball away in a costly area in the build-up."
62',action,"Morata gets into the penalty area, but Sidnei shuffles across to make a good tackle. The set-piece is worked short and whipped into the box, but Albentosa heads to safety. Moments later, the ex-Eibar defender tries to make another intervention from inside his own penalty box, and stabbed a low ball straight at Tyton."
61',action,"The home side have only got half an hour to see out at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu, with Zidane's men searching for the second goal required to make the points safe. Nacho drills in a low cross from the left-hand side, but Albentosa lashes a clearance into touch. The defending from Deportivo is getting a little more desperate."
59',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Raúl Albentosa Redal. Albentosa picks up a yellow card for diving into a poor tackle on Nacho, with the centre-back arguing that it was only his first foul of the night."
58',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Emre Çolak sub-in José Luis Sanmartín Mato . Joselu is brought into the game for the away side, with Emre Colak taking his leave."
58',action,"Asensio tries down the left-hand side and ghosts infield, before play is worked out to Danilo. The Brazilian is tackled strongly, and appears to be in some discomfort, with Deportivo breaking upfield at pace. Babel runs into traffic and the move comes to a halt, with physios then required to come on for the ex-Porto defender."
56',action,"Real Madrid work their way upfield at pace, with Zidane's men trying to control the game and set the foundations for a strong final half an hour. James bends in a cross from the left-hand side, but Morata is beaten to the delivery by Sidnei."
54',action,"The away side enjoy a long spell of possession, but they don't really go anywhere with the ball. Danilo manages to earn a free-kick on the right, which is guided in towards the back post, but Morata can only head an effort high into the air. Poor marking again from the away side."
52',action,"Deportivo win a free-kick deep on the right-hand side, but a lofted, sailing delivery can't pick out a visiting player at the back post. Garitano's men may have to alter their approach to the game now, given that they have to come from behind."
50',assist,"Assist Francisco Román Alarcón Suárez. Isco sets a neat pass infield, with picks out Morata, and the striker does the rest."
50',goal,"Goal Álvaro Borja Morata Martín. GOOOOOOOOAL! MORATA MAKES IT 1-0! James combines with Isco on the counter-attack, but the Spaniard flicks a pass in behind that Tyton gobbles up. Nacho is picked out on the overlap down the left-hand side, before setting a pass back to Isco, who then finds Morata. The Spain international takes aim from long-range, and picks out the top-right corner brilliantly!"
48',action,"Isco tries to drive forward down the right-hand side, with Danilo then driving into space on the overlap. He tries to whip in a cross, but it heads out of play. Real Madrid are retaining the ball well, with Zidane's men coming out for the second half firing on all cylinders."
46',action,"We are underway in the second half at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu! The hosts have been unable to find a breakthrough so far, but Los Blancos will have to keep an eye on a Deportivo side who are fancying themselves on the break and from set pieces this evening."
,action,"HALF-TIME! Real Madrid and Deportivo go into the interval goalless, but the away side have struck the woodwork on two occasions. The hosts have threatened through James and Isco, but the deadlock remains intact. Zidane will need to get his players a bit more motivated for the second half."
45',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ryan Babel. Babel picks up a yellow card for clashing with Pepe, after deliberately stepping across his man when the ball was dropping."
45',action,"Danilo breaks into the penalty area and then goes down due to a push, but the referee doesn't think that it is worthy of a penalty. Babel did push the Brazilian a little, but he went down in stages there. A good decision from the referee."
43',action,"Danilo whips in a cross from the right-hand side, but James can only poke a volleyed finish wide of the back post. Real Madrid are knocking on the door, but can't seem to find a breakthrough. Deportivo are sat very deep indeed, they're essentially camped on the edge of their box."
41',action,"Isco bends in a cross from the near post, but Morata can only divert a header onto Sidnei's chest and behind for a corner. The first set-piece comes to nothing, with the next nodded wide by Casemiro. There are less than five minutes for Deportivo to see out, and they're performing well so far."
39',action,"With less than 10 minutes on the clock in the first half, Deportivo are defending very deep. Isco tries to wriggle infield and approach the box, but Albentosa slides in to deny the ex-Malaga midfielder. Morata is then picked out at the back post, but the Spain international snatches at an attempt and Juanfran stabs a ball behind for a corner."
37',action,"Casemiro makes a great interception inside his penalty area, with Isco then trying to start a break for the home side. Morata cuts infield, but can't find an angle to shoot from, before the Brazilian joins the attack and blasts wildly over the crossbar!"
35',action,"OFF THE POST AGAIN! Deportivo win a free-kick deep on the right-hand side, with a flicked header from Borges kissing the woodwork, bouncing onto the turf and then looping over Guilherme at the far post. Real Madrid get away with it again!"
33',action,"Casemiro manages to rob the ball from Emre Colak, which sparks a break down the right-hand side, but Navarro covers across to deal with the danger. Both teams keep enjoying spells on the ball, but there's a lack of cutting edge on show. Morata gives away a free-kick for a scrappy tackle on Borges."
31',action,"Big chance for Isco! The Spaniard has a chance from close-range, with James also having the opportunity to follow up and turn home the rebound, after Albentosa failed to deal with a loose ball. Neither side can quite seem to find the breakthrough at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu."
29',action,"OFF THE POST! Albentosa drills in a low cross from the left-hand side, which Borges turns goalwards, but it strikes the foot of the upright with a bit of help from Navas. The referee, however, points for a goal-kick."
27',action,"Ramos takes aim from the resulting free-kick situation, but sends a powerful effort dipping just over the crossbar, as Ronaldo watches from the stands. Emre Colak makes progress down the right-hand side and tries to whip in cross, but he is tackled earlier. Deportivo then win a corner on the left, which is curled in, but Nacho heads clear well."
25',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Celso Borges Mora. Casemiro drives into midfield and beats a few players, before going down on the edge of the penalty area. Borges makes a cynical tackle to halt his progress, which earns the Costa Rica international a booking."
23',action,"The home side continue to retain possession, with their full-backs keen to break down both flanks. Asensio tries to lift a ball out to the left-hand side, but Juanfran gets there first. Ramos is perhaps lucky to get away with a poor tackle, as the Spain international dives into a poor challenge on Andone."
21',action,"Isco tracks back to make a great sliding tackle on Andone, after Babel tried to spark a break down the left-hand side. Deportivo have got forward sparingly thus far, but the Romania international has looked like a man on mission. He has the wind in his sails after scoring last week."
19',action,"Isco tries to wriggle into the penalty area from the right-hand side, but Sidnei tracks back and does brilliantly to rob the Spain international of possession. Real Madrid continue to ask all of the early questions, as Kroos tries to release Danilo in behind Navarro, but Tyton is quick off his line to get there first."
17',action,"Asensio bends in a great cross from the right-hand side, but his delivery is met by Tyton. The Polish goalkeeper spills the ball briefly, with James trying to turn home the rebound from close-range, but the Deportivo shot-stopper is quickly back to his feet to gobble up the loose ball."
15',action,"Isco shoots wide from long-range, after taking aim from an ambitious distance, as Real Madrid continue to put a lot of pressure on. Andone has been chasing lost causes up front, but often finds himself giving away cheap free-kicks after forcing opponents into touch situations."
13',action,"Great block from Albentosa! A terrible attempted clearance from Juanfran allows for Nacho to steal in at the back post, but the ex-Eibar defender is present to deflect the Real Madrid defender's close-range effort over the crossbar. That was a big opportunity."
11',action,"Andone is picked out making a run in behind, but the former Cordoba man is penalised for shunting into Pepe while attempting to get onto the end of the throughball. Danilo is guilty of another terrible pass upfield, which sparks a few groans within the crowd. He isn't doing himself any favours so far!"
9',action,"Deportivo have calmed down with their play, and now are sat rather deeper, after a bright opening few exchanges. Andone is leading the line, but otherwise all of the visiting forward options are offering their services much deeper to aid their midfield. Zidane is also out of his technical area and right on the touchline, he wants to get his ideas across early on."
7',action,"The home side are calling the shots early on, and Asensio has already shown his fantastic technical ability with some neat touches. Kroos opens his body up and lets fly with a right-footed effort from around 30 yards out, but blasts a fierce attempt straight into Sidnei."
5',action,"Asensio wins the ball back high upfield, before attempting to exchange a one-two with Danilo, but the ex-Porto wing-back slots his pass straight out of play for a throw-in. Not ideal from the Brazil international. Real Madrid enjoy a long spell of possession, with Zidane's men happy to settle down and get their foot on the ball."
3',action,"It is a bright start in Madrid, as Deportivo are more than happy to play at a fast pace and get the ball fizzing around themselves. Marco Asensio goes on a mazy run, which sees the Spaniard find Morata on the far side, but the ex-Juventus striker is caught straying slightly offside. A bad mistake to make, given that he could look along the entire visiting back four from his position."
1',action,"We are underway in the first half in the Spanish capital! Real Madrid need three points to keep their cushion at the top of La Liga intact, but Deportivo are arriving with no fear and the target of picking up a share of the spoils to aid their bid to get away from the drop zone."
,action,"Deportivo substitutes: Lux, Mosquera, Joselu, Moreno, Arribas, Luisinho, Fajr."
,action,"Deportivo starting line-up (4-2-3-1): Tyton; Juanfran, Albentosa, Sidnei, Fernando Navarro; Guilherme, Broges; Carles Gil, Emre Colak, Babel; Andone."

,action,"Real Madrid starting line-up (4-3-3): Navas; Danilo, Pepe, Sergio Ramos, Nacho; Kroos, Casemiro, Isco; James, Morata, Asensio."
,action,"TEAM NEWS: Fernando Navarro continues at left-back for the away side, with Celso Borges and Guilherme chosen to anchor the midfield. The attack remains the same from the win against Real Sociedad, with Ryan Babel, Emre Colak and Carles Gil supporting the lone striker of Florin Andone. The likes of Marlos Moreno and Joselu are other attacking options that Gaizka Garitano can call upon."
,action,"TEAM NEWS: Danilo and Nacho rotate in at full-back, with Pepe given a chance ahead of Raphael Varane at centre-back. Toni Kroos gets a first league start in a long while, as he returns from injury, with Casemiro also featuring. James, Isco and Marco Asensio are the trio to supply Alvaro Morata, with the latter needing to get some first-team action under his belt after suffering from a hamstring problem. Karim Benzema, Luka Modric and Cristiano Ronaldo aren't even on the bench for the hosts."
,action,"Deportivo are yet to win on the road this season in La Liga, but will believe that anything is possible after their huge win last time out. Barcelona picked up three points away against Osasuna earlier, however, which means that Real Madrid have to be professional and see out another much-needed victory in the Spanish top flight. They can stay six points clear at the top with a victory."
,action,"Due to having a trip to Japan for the Club World Championship in the offing this month, Los Blancos are rotating slightly, with a few players getting a chance to impress. After falling to a late 2-2 draw with Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League during the week at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu, their home supporters will want an improved result tonight."
,action,"Hello and welcome to live coverage of Real Madrid's home league game against Deportivo. The visitors are in high spirits, after defeating in-form Real Sociedad 5-1 last time out, but Zinedine Zidane's men will be approaching this game in uncompromising fashion due to having one eye on the league title already this season."
