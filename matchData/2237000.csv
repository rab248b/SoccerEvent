,action,"FULL-TIME! PSG close out a hard-fought 3-1 away win over Dijon in Ligue 1, with late goals from Cavani and Thiago Silva enough to help the visitors over the line. Lucas opened the scoring, before Tavares replied, with Emery's men labouring for a long while before finding their vital breakthrough. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+2',action,"Varrault is forced to lash a rushed clearance behind for a PSG corner, which Draxler will take. The Germany international plays it short, with the away side looking to run down the clock by retaining possession for the last 60 seconds or so."
90'+1',action,There are three minutes of second-half stoppage time. Areola easily claims a looping cross from the left-hand side.
89',action,"The home side are still trying to lead the charge with some counter-attacks, but this game has long been past them. Marie tries to bend in a cross from deep on the right-hand side, but Rabiot makes a simple block to deny the substitute."
87',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Pierre Lees Melou sub-in Dylan Bahamboula . Lees-Melou takes his leave after putting in a real shift, with Bahamboula adding some fresh legs into the mix for the dying embers of this contest."
87',yellow-card,Yellow Card Serge Aurier. Aurier picks up a late booking for halting a Dijon counter-attack in its tracks with a high foot.
85',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Edinson Roberto Cavani Gómez sub-in Christopher Nkunku . Nkunku comes into the fray for the last few minutes, with Cavani heading off after finally getting his goal."
85',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Florent Balmont sub-in Jordan Marié . Balmont jogs off for the last five minutes, with Marie given a late run-out."
84',goal,"Goal Edinson Roberto Cavani Gómez. GOOOOAL! CAVANI MAKES IT THREE! That is the win wrapped up for the away side. The Uruguay international is able to find the back of the net from close range, following a good bit of improvisation. A shot from Guedes is angled goalwards, with the PSG goalscorer then flicking the ball home in unorthodox fashion past a wrong-footed goalkeeper. The home fans think he was offside!"
83',action,"Lees-Melou is picked out at the back post brilliantly by a cross from the left, but the French midfielder's low shot is blocked by Kurzawa. Dijon win themselves a corner on the right, which is met by Tavares, but the hosts' striker can only direct his header a long way over the crossbar."
81',goal,"Goal Thiago Emiliano da Silva. GOOOOOOOOAL! THIAGO SILVA MAKES IT 2-1! The captain nets a vital goal for PSG. Aurier saw a shot well blocked, leading to a corner for the away side on the left. The delivery is swung in and met in the air by Motta, with Reynet doing well to push the ball onto the post. Silva followed up, before rattling home a close-range finish to edge Les Parisiens in front."
79',action,"Ben Arfa races down the right-hand side and gets to the byline with a lovely touch. He clips a cross into the box, that Draxler looks to meet with an acrobatic finish, but the German gets his angles all wrong. Dijon respond with a break upfield, but Tavares is quickly dispossessed while trying to get in behind PSG's defence."
78',action,"Rufli and Aurier have to be given some stern words from the referee, with the hosts trying to frustrate wherever possible. Chafik overlaps down the right-hand side and gets into the penalty box, but Kurzawa does brilliantly to get the right side of his man and earn himself a cheap free-kick."
76',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Marvin Martin sub-in Jérémy Bela . Martin takes his leave, with Bela introduced."
76',action,"The home fans are starting to get a little more excited now, with PSG struggling to find a breakthrough heading towards the last 10 minutes. Cavani is played in behind the Dijon back four, and Reynet races out to smother the ball ahead of the Uruguayan striker, but play is pulled back for a previous offside decision anyway."
74',action,"Cavani meets a curling cross from the right-hand side, but the Uruguay international can only direct his header a long way high and wide of the target. Dijon respond with an attack of their own, but Diony's cross is too long."
72',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Blaise Matuidi sub-in Goncalo Manuel Ganchinho Guedes . Matuidi is also taken off, with Guedes having the opportunity to make himself a hero by joining Cavani up top."
72',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Lucas Rodrigues Moura da Silva sub-in Hatem Ben Arfa . Ben Arfa is introduced to add a little bit of flair and creativity, with Lucas making way."
70',action,"A looping delivery from the right-hand side is easy for Reynet to claim, as Dijon continue to defend quite comfortably. Only 20 minutes remain for PSG to find a winning goal, and Draxler appears to be the key man to do it"
68',action,"Dijon are sat in their shape, waiting patiently for the chance to use Diony and Tavares' pace. Matuidi goes on a driving run forward, before Cavani feeds a reverse pass into Draxler. The German winger tees up Matuidi on the edge of the area, but the France international fires a powerful effort straight down Reynet's throat!"
66',action,"The home fans are making plenty of noise, as with every minute that PSG fail to score, it gives the underdogs fresh belief that they can grind out a share of the spoils. Lucas tries his luck from long-range, in a show of frustration, but the Brazilian can't hit the target."
64',action,"Emery's men are still patiently probing, waiting for a gap to exploit, but Dijon are forcing PSG to eventually resort to a long pass to break the monotony. A couple of changes could be in the offing, as PSG's current personnel aren't quite asking enough of a well-protected host defence."
62',action,"Rabiot flights in a cross from deep on the right, but Loties nods clear, before Dijon head forward on the break. Diony races down the right flank and threatens to get into the box, but Rabiot and Matuidi track back brilliantly to ensure that the hosts' striker doesn't have the chance to test Areola."
61',action,"We're into the last half an hour of this precariously poised contest, and PSG need to take one of their chances before Dijon do themselves. Emery's men are controlling the ball and asking all of the questions, but all it takes is one mistake from Les Parisiens for their opponents to break away and punish their profligacy."
59',action,"PSG whip in a corner from the right-hand side, which comes to nothing, but Rabiot follows up. The French midfielder gets the ball onto his right foot and powers a strike goalwards from 20 yards out, but it sails harmlessly over the crossbar. That won't be worrying Reynet whatsoever."
57',action,"Close for Draxler! The ex-Wolfsburg wide man keeps his composure inside the penalty area, before curling a shot towards the top-right corner. Reynet just about has enough time to get up and push the ball clear of the danger zone. That really should have been 2-1."
55',action,"Loties appeared to jar his knee, as Matuidi fell into his outstretched leg, but the Dijon defender is going to try and continue. The hosts rob Draxler of the ball and try to lead a counter, but they quickly surrender possession themselves. This game is getting very untidy indeed."
54',action,"PSG win a free-kick deep on the right-hand side, but Dijon manage to clear their lines pretty quickly. Cavani challenges for Lucas' delivery, but Loties gets in the way, with the hosts' centre-back then going down with an injury problem. He needs some treatment, and a replacement is being readied."
53',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Vincent Rüfli. Rufli picks up a yellow card for a foul in a fairly non-threatening area of the field, but the dead-ball situation comes to nothing."
52',action,"Thiago Silva sees a shot blocked well by Chafik, after a PSG corner on the right-hand side caused a few problems for the hosts. Moments later, Kurzawa has the chance to shoot from the periphery of the area, but the French left-back thunders a low drive into a ruck of defenders."
50',action,"Cavani is the target of a cross in from the right-hand side, but the Uruguay international can only watch as the ball deflects off Loties, onto himself and then behind for a goal-kick. Draxler is drifting infield and coming deep in a bid to exert more influence on the game, but it isn't quite working yet. Diony almost manages to escape on the break for the hosts, but Kurzawa makes a vital interception."
48',action,"PSG start the second half as they finished the first, with plenty of aimless possession. Emery's men are controlling the game, but only in terms of forcing Dijon to shuffle over from side to side endlessly. The visitors need a little spark of genius from somewhere."
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half! PSG are currently at risk of falling off the title pace by dropping further points in the league, as Dijon look organised and ready to grind out a result."
,action,"HALF-TIME! PSG are in danger of dropping further points in Ligue 1, as Dijon are currently holding Les Parisiens to a 1-1 draw. Lucas opened the scoring, before Tavares levelled almost immediately, with the away side having plenty of the ball without really doing too much with it. Emery will need his players to step it up a gear in the second half."
45'+1',action,There is one minute of first-half stoppage time.
45',action,"Rabiot and Cavani combine nicely on the edge of the penalty area, but the former gets the ball stolen off his boot as he shapes to shoot from close-range. Moments later, the ex-Napoli striker is able to pounce on a throughball from Draxler, but Loties covers across to make a brilliant sliding block. Reynet punches the resulting corner clear."
43',action,"PSG continue to hold onto possession and manipulate their opponents, but Dijon are defending very well indeed. It is easy to see why they have had such a brilliant home record in Ligue 1 this season. Only a few minutes remain in this first half for the visitors to pull back ahead."
41',action,"Wide from Motta! The Italian midfielder is picked out in the opposition penalty area, but can only guide a flying volley the wrong side of the post. From that range, he will be disappointed that he didn't hit the target, but the ball was at an awkward height."
39',action,"Kurzawa tries to break to the left byline, but Chafik puts the France international under enough pressure to see him run the ball straight out of play himself. PSG have found their composure again and are dictating play, but a second goal before half-time isn't looking likely. Draxler slots a cross straight at Reynet."
37',action,"Lucas makes some progress down the right-hand side, with a deflected cross from the Brazil international causing a few problems for Chafik. PSG maintain their pressure, but the Moroccan right-back is eventually able to clip a clearance up the line."
35',action,"PSG flash a couple of poor crosses into the danger zone, but Cavani is continuing to feed off scraps in terms of having opportunities lined up for him directly. Motta is found racing to the left byline, but the away side end up recycling possession, with their switches of play needing to be much quicker in order to trouble Dijon."
33',action,"This game is brilliantly end-to-end at the moment, with Tavares causing all sorts of issues with his pace and power on the break. Marquinhos is struggling to live with the Dijon goalscorer. The home fans are making plenty of noise now, they fancy their team to go on and cause an upset tonight."
32',yellow-card,Yellow Card Thiago Motta. Thiago Motta picks up a booking for arguing with the referee in the aftermath of Dijon's equaliser.
31',goal,"Goal Júlio Tavares. GOOOOOOOAL! DIJON LEVEL IMMEDIATELY! Areola has absolutely no chance there. A driving run down the right-hand side causes PSG problems, with a neat cut-back from Lees-Melou finding Tavaras in space. The hosts' forward composedly slots a beautiful finish into the top-right corner."
31',assist,"Assist Pierre Lees Melou. Lees-Melou continues to cause problems down the right-hand side, and his intelligent pass to the edge of the box is perfect."
29',goal,"Goal Lucas Rodrigues Moura da Silva. GOOOOOOOAL! LUCAS MAKES IT 1-0! It isn't pretty, but the away team don't care. Aurier curls in a cross from the right-hand side, from which Rabiot sees a shot blocked. The rebound falls to Lucas, who initially has an effort blocked on the line, but the Brazilian thumps home at the second time of asking to get PSG's breakthrough."
28',action,"Emery is looking quite tense on the touchline, as the Spaniard needs his team to edge ahead in order to dispel their current nerves. Dijon are staying in their shape well, forcing PSG into non-threatening areas of the field."
26',action,"PSG are continuing to labour in possession, with the tempo rather slow and no big chances to speak of. Frustrations are growing a little for the away side, and Dijon will only continue to grow in confidence as PSG fire blanks. A cross from the right flashes across the hosts' net, but nobody is present at the back post to tap home."
24',action,"The hosts will be pleased to have limited PSG to a couple of half-chances inside this opening half an hour. Lees-Melou drives forward in midfield and tries to shoot from 25 yards out, but the Frenchman sees his effort blocked. Moments later, frustrations spill over due to a disagreement between Draxler and Balmont."
22',action,"Martin tries to lift a free-kick delivery into the PSG box, but it is far too heavy and skids behind for a goal-kick. PSG are happy to enjoy more possession and build out from their defence, but Dijon are containing their high-flying opponents quite easily."
20',action,"Aurier plays a one-two with Draxler, but Abeid shuffles across to clear behind for a corner. Lucas bends in the set-piece, but it is headed behind for another dead-ball opportunity, with the second flicked wide of the target by Cavani."
18',action,"Areola makes a fairly easy save after Tavares looked to dip in a cross from the right-hand side. Diony was lurking, but the French goalkeeper got there first. Moments later, Matuidi is robbed of possession, but Rabiot tracks back well to make a recovering tackle and spare his teammate's blushes."
16',action,"PSG go close! Kurzawa bends in a low cross from the left-hand side, that Reynet can only parry! The rebound falls out to Matuidi, who has the goal at his mercy, but the France international pummels a shot straight at Loties! It looked easier to score, there."
14',action,"The away side are enjoying much more of the ball and as a result are looking to build some patient attacks. Dijon are looking composed and organised, however, with PSG needing to keep probing for a gap. Draxler and Lucas are yet to get onto the ball in dangerous pockets of space."
12',action,"PSG definitely haven't had things all their own way early on, with Cavani a little disappointed to not pick up a penalty for his coming-together with Reynet. Dijon build another attack, which this time results in a cross being whipped in from the right, but Areola makes a simple catch."
10',action,"Lucas is trying to get involved by drifting infield from the right-hand side with regularity, but Reynet has still not been worried. The goalkeeper is called into action for the first time, striding off his line to push a throughball away from Cavani. The Frenchman's hand get nastily trodden upon in the process."
8',action,"PSG threaten down at the other end, as Lucas tries to bend a cross in towards the back post, but the ball sails harmlessly out of play. Emery won't be too pleased with how his side have started this evening, as Dijon are growing in confidence. The home side escape down the left, but a cross from Rufli is terrible."
6',action,"Balmont is pickpocketed by Draxler in midfield, but play is pulled back for the German winger clipping the heels of his opponent slightly. This has been a very even game so far, with Dijon having the pace in forward areas to make themselves a nuisance. After a misplaced pass in their own box, Martin cracks a shot onto the post!"
4',action,"The hosts escape down the right-hand side, with Marquinhos needed to come over and deny a bursting run from Lees-Melou. The Brazilian centre-back comes in well to rob back possession, and Dijon are looking capable of causing a few problems on the counter-attack."
2',action,"Areola is immediately involved for the away side, with the young goalkeeper needing to get off his line quickly to slide into a tackle at the feet of Diony. The Dijon wide man takes a tumble, but the Frenchman got all of the ball. Nervy start!"
1',action,"We are underway in the first half! PSG will be hoping to keep up their improved form of late, but Dijon are more than capable of causing an upset while enjoying their own home comforts."
