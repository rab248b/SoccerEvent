,action,Thanks for joining us this evening! That’s all from us from Signal Iduna Park as Borussia Dortmund triumph over Eintracht Frankfurt by three goals to one.
,action,Full time in Dortmund. Reus gave the hosts the perfect start before a glory goal from Sokratis and mandatory strike from Aubameyang wrapped up the points for Tuchel's side.
90'+2',action,SAVE! Hradecky proving he's still awake in this match as Aubameyang slips a pass through to Kagawa but the Japanese international's shot was saved well as the goalkeeper spread himself.
90',action,Eintracht are just trying ambitious shots now as Blum found himself in a bit of space 25 yards from goal but his effort was well over Burki's crossbar and into the fans behind the goal.
88',action,An explosion of relief has whipped around Signal Iduna Park following that goal from Aubameyang and the atmosphere has once again peaked.
86',assist,Assist Ousmane Dembélé. Dembele with a beautifully weighted pass to pick out Aubameyang one-on-one with the goalkeeper and the rest was a formality.
86',goal,"Goal Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. GOAL! Game, set, match. Aubameyang gets his 26th of the season by calmly chipping over Hradecky when one-on-one with the goalkeeper."
84',action,"A free-kick in a dangerous position from Castro is turned towards goal instead of crossing into the box, but there wasn't enough power on his shot and Hradecky catches with ease."
82',action,Dortmund are really grinding for this win! Frankfurt have been unable to craft any significant chances in this half and it's been down to how strong the hosts have been on the ball.
81',substitution,Substitution sub-out Branimir Hrgota sub-in Aymen Barkok . Barkok is on for Hrgota.
80',action,Blum and Rebic almost combine well to grant Eintracht a chance as the former floated a deep cross to the latter but the forward was unable to pick the ball out of the air.
78',action,"It's looking unlikely Frankfurt are going to end their winless run today, but they're still in this fixture and all it takes is one mistake at the back from Dortmund."
77',substitution,Substitution sub-out Julian Weigl sub-in Gonzalo Castro Randon . Weigl has been given a deserved rest as Castro comes on.
75',action,"Weigl has been absolutely brilliant for Dortmund in this match as they look to consolidate. The youngster is continuing to thrive in Tuchel's team, much to the delight of the German national team."
73',action,"There hasn't been much action on the pitch, but it's not stopping the Dortmund faithful from cheering on their team as chants from the home support ring around Signal Iduna Park."
71',substitution,Substitution sub-out Marius Wolf sub-in Danny Blum . Blum comes on for Wolf.
70',action,"CLOSE! Talking of long shots, Fabian took aim once again with a first-time effort and drags his shot inches wide of Burki's right post."
68',action,Dortmund are doing well to keep Eintracht at bay here and are reducing them to long shots from range to retain their lead.
66',action,"Corner to Dortmund, with Dembele taking the honours, but the cross into the box was deep and despite Sokratis winning the ball with Vallejo he couldn't direct his header on goal."
64',action,"Wolf thought he found himself some space on the wing to attack Dortmund, but Schmelzer done well to come across and apply pressure to the winger and win back possession."
62',action,STAT: Eintracht Frankfurt have won just twice in the league at Signal Iduna Park since 1983.
60',action,It seems as if all the excitement from this match was used up in the first! This fixture has gone from an open affair to a cagey game with few chances to talk about.
58',action,"Aubameyang thought he had his chance! The ball broke to the striker in the box as he fired a shot away, but there was a sea of red shirts in the way and the danger was cleared."
56',action,The change for Frankfurt marks a change in tactics from Kovac as it seems the visitors will be reverting to a more traditional back four with Rebic joining Hrgota up top.
56',substitution,Substitution sub-out Anderson Rafael Ordóñez Valdéz sub-in Ante Rebić . Rebic comes on for Ordonez.
54',action,Few chances to report on this half with both sides being a bit more cautious with the next goal being absolutely crucial in the outcome of this fixture.
52',action,"Dortmund are playing much calmer possession football in this half, which one can only presume has been instructed by Tuchel as the hosts did seem vulnerable at times."
50',action,"CHANCE! A free-kick from Fabian was headed back into the box to Hrgota, who thought he had been presented with a one-on-one, but the linesman correctly flagged the striker offside."
48',action,"A much slower start in this half, which will certainly please Kovac after his side couldn't get their bearings in the first."
46',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Marco Reus sub-in Ousmane Dembélé . Dembele comes on for Reus, which appears to be injury related rather than tactical."
46',substitution,Substitution sub-out Sven Bender sub-in Matthias Ginter . Ginter comes on for Bender.
46',action,Dortmund get the second half underway!
,action,"Sokratis' moment of magic seperates the sides, but Eintracht have presented themselves well at Signal Iduna Park thus far. Stay with us for the second half!"
45'+1',action,"CHANCE! A cross into the box from Reus from a corner kick was met by Sokratis in the air, but the Greek defender headed his effort over the crossbar."
44',action,"It looks as if Dortmund are going to head into the break with a lead here, but they must be wary that Frankfurt have presented danger to them a number of times in the first 45."
42',action,"A loose touch from Bender allowed Chandler to steal the ball away from the Dortmund defender in the middle of the park, which forced the German international to bring the full-back down."
39',action,"Dortmund are looking to just knock the tempo down a notch as the half-time break approaches. It's not been the Yellow-Black's strongest performance so far, but they've looked good."
37',action,"Sokratis with just his second goal in the Bundesliga this season, and it's fair to say that nobody inside Signal Iduna Park expected that from him. Hradecky didn't even attempt to save it!"
34',assist,"Assist Sven Bender. Bender gets the assist, but nothing should be taken away from Sokratis for that piece of brilliance."
34',goal,Goal Sokratis Papastathopoulos. OH WOW! GOAL! Sokratis with a goal Aubameyang would have been proud of. The Greek international skipped past Mascarell in midfield before unleashing a thunderous strike into the top corner from outside the box.
33',action,"Dortmund are playing great football but they're doing so with a dangerously high line and are giving Eintracht opportunities to counter-attack, which has been the reason for most of their chances this afternoon."
31',action,"Eintracht may be level, but the hosts are still keeping the atmosphere alive in the stadium. However, it doesn't seem to be stopping the Eagles who are playing with more confidence."
29',assist,Assist Bastian Oczipka. Oczipka gets the assist for spotting the Mexican on the edge of the box.
29',goal,"Goal Marco Jhonfai Fabián De La Mora. GOAL! He may have missed a sitter earlier, but my goodness what a strike! Eintracht are level thanks to Mexican magic from Fabian to drill into the top corner from 20 yards out."
28',action,The Dortmund players are pacing everywhere! It seems like whoever is on the ball there are options open across the pitch. Fantastic work rate from the home team.
26',action,"Injury! A stoppage in play as Vallejo and Gacinovic clashed heads as they both battled to clear the ball away from danger, but it appears as if both will be good to continue."
24',action,SAVE! Burki is called into action as a fantastic cross from Wolf is met in the middle by Gacinovic despite pressure from two defenders but the Swiss goalkeeper made a great reaction save to keep the hosts in the lead.
22',action,"An opportunity for Frankfurt as great work from Oczipka allowed Wolf to drill a low cross into the midfielder, but he was unable to get over his strike properly and put it over the crossbar."
20',action,"CLOSE! An awful mistake from Abraham to slip and allow Reus to pinch the ball off the defender, but fortunately for Frankfurt Hradecky flew off his line to sweep the danger away."
18',action,"Eintracht have been solid at the back all season, with the third best defence in the league, but they're just hacking the ball away with no real objective. The Eagles look really poor defensively this afternoon."
16',action,STAT: Dortmund are fast starters. Reus' goal was the 14th they've scored in the first 15 minutes - the highest in the Bundesliga.
14',action,"CLOSE!  A diagonal pass was floated over to Schmelzer, with the full-back doing brilliantly to get the ball past Chandler with his first touch, but his low cross into the middle was cleared by a sliding tackle from Vallejo."
12',action,Kovac has noticed his side are on the back foot and he's screaming from the side lines. It's looking as if he's telling Abraham to change his positioning.
10',action,AN AWFUL MISS! Hrogota broke behind the Dortmund defence and squared a pass to Fabian for the Mexican to tap home but he put his shot wide of the goal from ten yards out.
8',action,CLOSE! An awkward clearance from Vallejo was almost sliced past Hradecky! The defender was committed to tapping a cross from Pulisic away but almost scored an own goal in the process.
6',action,"Dortmund are looking extremely confident in the opening exchanges with some confident, free-flowing football. The early goal ruins the away side's attempt to contain BVB, too."
4',action,Signal Iduna Park is rocking! The Yellow Wall is in its full voice with the early goal for the hosts and it's only making Eintracht's job harder.
3',assist,"Assist Christian Pulisic. A lot of credit must lie with Pulisic, here. The American worked exceptionally hard to receive the one-two from Aubameyang and round Hradecky before squaring the ball to Reus."
3',goal,"Goal Marco Reus. GOAL! Dortmund get the start they needed! Reus is back, and he's back with a goal. A great one-two between Aubameyang and Pulisic allowed Reus to backheel into the net."
1',action,Eintracht get the game underway!
,action,"Both Tuchel and Kovac have opted for changes going into this fixture, with Marco Reus coming back into the starting XI since injury among some rotations from Europe. Not long until kick-off now!"
