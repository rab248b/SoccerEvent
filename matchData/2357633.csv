,action,"Full-time in Yokahama as Real Madrid win the Club World Cup! Zinedine Zidane's men have claimed the trophy after eventually overcoming J League champions, Kashima Antlers, 4-2 after extra-time. Ronaldo was typically the man of the moment as he bagged a superb hat-trick, with Benzema also getting on the scoresheet, but Kashima can be massively proud of their achievements and certainly acquitted themselves superbly on he night. Thanks for joining us!"
118',action,"Madrid have completely dominated proceedings since that third goal went in as it really took the confidence out of Kashima, who had battled so bravely up until that point. The Spanish giants are just professionally running down the clock towards their second Club World Cup title in three years."
116',action,"With Ronaldo now off the pitch, and Bale out injured of course, free-kick duties have fell to Isco. The former Malaga man has the opportunity to get away a shot on goal with a set-piece from around 30 yards out, but ends up being forced to settle for the corner after his attempt bounces off the top of the wall to go behind."
114',substitution,Substitution sub-out Ryota Nagaki sub-in Shuhei Akasaki . Another change from the J League champions as Nagaki makes way for sub-in Shuhei Akasaki.
112',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro sub-in Álvaro Borja Morata Martín . The Yokahama crowd rise to their feet now as Ronaldo makes his way to the sidelines to a roaring applause, from both the Kashima and Real Madrid faithful. He is certainly popular around there parts, especially after smashing in a brilliant hat-trick to win the tournament. Morata is his replacement."
110',action,"Ten minutes to go in the Club World Cup and although they will eventually lose, Kashima can be incredibly proud to have took Real Madrid to extra-time. As it so often happens, though, the clinching goal comes moments into extra-time which ultimately deflates the chasing team."
108',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Sergio Ramos García sub-in José Ignacio Fernández Iglesias . Nacho is given a run out for 10 minutes or so now, as Sergio Ramos is saved from getting another yellow card by being substituted."
106',action,The second period of extra-time is under way.
,action,Half-time in extra-time.
105',substitution,Substitution sub-out Luka Modrić sub-in Mateo Kovačić . Modric is replaced by Mateo Kovacic as Zidane looks to solidify that midfield area.
104',assist,"Assist Toni Kroos. Assist for Kroos, even if it was a shot..."
104',goal,Goal Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro. GOOOOAAAALLL! GOOOAAAALL FOR REAL MADRID! The contest is over! The ball falls fortuitously to Kroos on the edge of the box where the German fires a half-volley back into the danger area. The strike is going nowhere which actually allows Ronaldo to control with a lovely touch before smashing an emphatic finish into the roof of the net with his left foot! Four-two!
103',substitution,Substitution sub-out Yasushi Endo sub-in Yukitoshi Ito . Endo is replaced by sub-in Yukitoshi Ito for the Japanese side.
102',yellow-card,Yellow Card Daniel Carvajal Ramos. The bookings are coming thick and fast for Real Madrid now and the latest guilty party to see yellow if Carvajal.
102',action,"KASHIMA ANTLERS HIT THE WOODWORK! The Nissan Stadium very nearly explodes in cheers again only to be left disappointed as Suzuki initially does well to rise high inside the box, only to smash a commanding header straight off the top of the bar. He should have scored from such close range but Madrid survive!"
100',yellow-card,Yellow Card Carlos Henrique Casimiro. Casemiro sees yellow now.
99',action,"It will be interesting to see how Zidane's men approach this now as if they sit back on ther lead, Kashima will certainly grow in confidence with the crowd behind them. You get the feeling Madrid will go for the fourth goal to kill this contest off completely."
97',assist,Assist Karim Benzema. Superb assist from Benzema with a defence-splitting pass.
97',goal,"Goal Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro. GOOOOAAAAAAALLLL FOR REAL MADRID! Is this the winner for Los Blancos?! Benzema is awarded too much space in the space in front of the defence and subsequently picks out a gorgeous threaded pass in behind the backline for Ronaldo, who takes an assured touch forward before lashing a strike under the oncoming goalkeeper! Three-two."
95',action,"So far, extra-time has followed pretty much the same formula as the closing stages of normal play as Real Madrid continue to knock at the door looking for their third goal. They will be wondering just how they haven't won in the opening 90 minutes considering their domination. Kashima still with a chance on the break, though."
93',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Fabricio dos Santos Messias. Fabricio is the latest player to see yellow here as he goes in late on Varane, needlessly, off the ball. However, if that is a bookable offence then that makes Sergio Ramos' escape all the more bizarre."
91',action,Extra-time is under way.
,action,End of 90 minutes in the Club World Cup final. We go into extra-time now as Real Madrid and Kashima Antlers can't be separated in normal time following a 2-2 draw. An extra 30 minutes of this pulsating final awaits.
90'+1',action,Three minutes of added time have been allocated by the referee.
90',action,"Well, Sergio Ramos is the luckiest man in Japan here as he takes out Kanazaki to halt a Kashima counter attack. He is already on a yellow card, but the referee completely bottles brandishing another that would result in Real Madrid going down to 10 men."
88',substitution,Substitution sub-out Shoma Doi sub-in Yuma Suzuki . Another change from the Japanese side as sub-in Yuma Suzuki comes on for sub-out Shoma Doi.
87',action,"SAAAAAVE FROM KEYLOR NAVAS! Fabricio almost ensures the roof blows off the top of the Yokahama Stadium as he smashes a superb strike on goal from around 25 yards out, but Kashima are thwarted by the Madrid goalkeeper who somehow gets across goal to tip over the bar!"
85',action,"Five minutes to go before the end of the 90, in which case we will play 30 minutes of extra-time and penalties. This wouldn't exactly be ideal fo Zidane and his charges who are still bang smack in the middle of their assault on the Spanish Primera Division title. Indeed, they were originally meant to take on Valencia this evening."
83',action,"The game has suddenly became very, very stretched now as with Real Madrid piling men forward looking to avoid extra-time with the winner, Kashima are growing in confidence after a few decent ventures into the final third. A couple of whipped crosses into the box have caused Los Blancos problems, with Sergio Ramos and co. needing to maintain discipline at the back."
81',substitution,Substitution sub-out Lucas Vázquez Iglesias sub-in Francisco Román Alarcón Suárez . First change of the match from Zinedine Zidane and that lovely bit of play moments ago from Vazquez will be his last contribution to the game. His replacement on the right flank will be Isco.
79',action,"Vazquez pops up down the right-hand side now and dazzles the left-back with some delightful stepovers before bursting into space to chip a teasing cross into the centre of the box. Ronaldo gets ahead of his marker to bullet a header on goal, but the direction doesn't match the power as the attempt goes a yard north of the bar. Not his best."
77',action,"A good period of pressure from Madrid here but even though there is plenty of neat and tidy passing in the final third, it is not coming with a high degree of penetration into the penalty box. Ronaldo is basically playing as a striker alongside Benzema now, but the duo aren't linking up to hurt this Kashima defence...yet."
75',action,"The game is pretty much attack versus defence at the moment as Real Madrid desperately probe for the winning goal. Kashima aren't showing much going forward, but as we have already discovered they can pop up unexpectedly with a goal if Los Blancos become complacent at the back."
73',action,"GOOOOOOAAAAAAALLL FOR REAL MADRID! WAIT! NO! OFFSIDE! A Benzema strike is deflected to the right of goal where Ronaldo pounces to squeeze a volleyed strike over the line from a tight angle, but the Portuguese is just ahead of the play as the linesman correctly raises his flag."
71',action,"Just under 20 minutes to go in this Club World Cup final and, perhaps surprisingly, we still are no closer to finding out who will lift the trophy. Madrid were fancied by many to win this clash very comfortably, but Kashima can be massively proud of their brave performance no matter what the scoreline ends up being."
69',action,"A small break in play at the moment as Sergio Ramos is currently down injured after taking a hell of a knock from his own goalkeeper, Navas. The Costa Rican actually did very well to dash out from between the sticks and out of the box to clear a dangerous ball with a commanding header, but in the process he completely took out his captain."
68',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Mitsuo Ogasawara sub-in Fabricio dos Santos Messias . First change of the match from Kashima Antlers as 37-year-old midfielder, Ogasawara, makes way for Fabricio."
66',action,"SAAAAVE FROM SOGAHATA! Benzema takes on the opposition backline with a marauding run down the left channel before eventually making it to the byline to reverse a cross back into the danger area. Marcelo meets it with a lashed strike from 10 yards out, but it is straight down the throat of the grateful Kashima stopper."
64',action,"Sergio Ramos, typically, is proving to be a huge threat to the opposition defence from set-pieces. Madrid's corner count is well into double figures now, and if the tallying up continues it will be a matter of time before the Spaniard latches on to a cross with a bullet header. He is too strong for this Kashima defence."
62',action,"Kashima need to sort themselves out here as they are looking weak at the back now after that Ronaldo equaliser. The Portuguese attempts to go for his second goal in as many minutes as he latches on to a mistake from the defender before cutting inside to drill a strike low to the bottom corner, only for Sogahata to deny him with the smart save."
60',penalty-goal,Penalty Goal Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro. GOOOOAAAAAAAAALLLLL FOR REAL MADRID! Ronaldo makes no mistake with his spotkick and confidently smashes a strike from the spot low into the bottom left corner! Two-two! GAME ON.
58',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Shuto Yamamoto. PENALTY TO REAL MADRID! Yamamoto, rather stupidly, absolutely scythes down Vazquez inside the box and Los Blancos have the opportunity to make it all-square again!"
57',action,"Benzema makes his way down the right channel by juggling the ball up and down with a few nice touches before finding the feet of Modric. Vazquez eventually sees possession further forward, but the attempted pass in behind the defence, with the Frenchman the target, is poor."
55',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Sergio Ramos García. First yellow card now, and no prizes for guessing that Sergio Ramos is the first player to get booked."
54',action,"Kashima were never going to be a walkover for Real Madrid as the Japanese side have proved their worth in this tournament so far. However, this will certainly be a shock to the system for Los Blancos as they are running the risk of coming on the wrong end of one of the upsets of the season!"
52',goal,Goal Gaku Shibasaki. GOOOOOOOAAAAALLLL FOR KASHIMA ANTLERS! THIS IS INCREDIBLE! Shibasaki is the man of the moment for the J League champions as he evades three attempted challenges on the edge of the box before lashing a left-footed strike low into the corner past the despairing Navas! Two-one! Sensational.
50',action,"A rare corner for the Japanese side here, which will be taken by Endo. The subsequent cross into the centre of the box is decent and Madrid struggle to clear with a series of lofted attempted clearances high into the air, but Zidane's men are let off the hook as Kroos is eventually fouled for the free-kick."
48',action,"An excellent start to the second period from Madrid, much in the same fashion as how they began the second. Plenty of menace going forward from Los Blancos as they look to restore the lead as early as possible in the second 45."
46',action,The second half is under way in the Nissan Stadium!
,action,Half-time in Yokahama. We certainly have a final on our hands now as Real Madrid and Kashima Antlers go into the break at 1-1 following a brilliant equaliser from Shibasaki moments before half-time following an early opening from Benzema. A cracking second period on the cards!
43',goal,"Goal Gaku Shibasaki. GOOOOAAAALL! GOOOAAALLLL FOR KASHIMA! The stadium explodes in cheers! Doi jinks left and right down the left-hand side before cutting inside to whip a speculative cross into the box. Real Madrid make a meal of the clearance, with Varane putting in a weak tackle, and this allows Shibasaki to latch on and smash a cracking half-volley low into the bottom corner! One-one!"
41',action,"Kashima get a rare corner-kick opportunity which is eventually easily cleared by Madrid. The Spanish giants pounce on the counter and it is actually Varane who leads the charge with a commanding sprint forward, leaving plenty of markers in his wake as he eats up the space. He links up with Benzema down the left, but the attack comes to nothing as the striker eventually concedes the foul on Nishi."
39',action,"Ronaldo opens up his considerable stride with a bursting run forward and lays a pass into Benzema, who just attempts to return the favour with a clever flick back to his team-mate. Possession goes loose only for Kroos to recover the attack with a pass out wide to Marcelo, but Kashima defend well in the end and manage to clear up the park."
37',action,"Lovely stuff from Madrid here as all the attackers are involved in a sweeping move with a series of delightful touches. The latest comes from Ronaldo who just ushers possession into the feet of Modric, but the resulting strike on goal from the Croatian is curled weakly into the arms of the grateful goalkeeper, Sogahata."
35',action,"Varane and Sergio Ramos have been very comfortable in this first half as Kashima are really struggling to lay a glove on the Madrid defence as a whole. A few speculative strikes on goal have came from the J League champions, but they haven't created a real golden opportunity yet."
33',action,"Things aren't going too well for Ronaldo at the moment. Seconds after that poor free-kick, the Ballon d'Or winner breaks down a promising Real Madrid counter by allowing the ball to get caught under his feet with Kashima on the ropes at the back. He looks angry at himself."
31',action,"Madrid get he free-kick inside the right channel and Ronaldo will take it, with his signature pre-strike posture. The Portuguese sees his strike smash into the wall, only to fire another attempt on goal from the rebound, but this too is disappointing and goes high and wide into the crowd."
29',action,"A good period of sustained possession from Real Madrid at the moment as they probe for the second goal, which could very well kill off this contest completely. Decent organisation and defending from Kashima, but they will do well to reach half-time with just the one-goal deficit."
27',action,"Benzema goes deep to see a bit more of the ball and turns sharply in midfield before moving forward and exchanging a lovely one-two with Vazquez. The Frenchman then moves into space inside the box before dragging a left-footed strike low towards the bottom corner, but Sogahata is there to turn behind for another Real Madrid corner."
25',action,"Very nearly a collectors item for Real Madrid here as Casemiro goes for a rare goal. On this occasion, the Brazilian midfielder tries his luck with an attempt from 25 yards out, but doesn't even get the chance to test the goalkeeper as the strike cannons off the defender to go behind for a corner-kick."
23',action,"Endo is looking bright for Kashima and appears to have quite the dazzling feet coming in from the right touchline. He goes to take on the Madrid defence once again and gets into a lovely area around 18 yards out, but the subsequent strike on goal is slammed into the side-netting with Navas once again untested between the sticks."
21',action,"We are just approaching the midway point of the first half now and Madrid are looking relatively comfortable with their narrow lead at the moment. Kashima continue to adapt a decent tempo in the final third, but they need to start testing Navas if they are going to have a hope of equalising."
19',action,"Ronaldo gets the chance to stretch his legs down the left wing as he has plenty of space to run into. Fair play to Nishi as he manages to keep up pace with the Portuguese, who ends up being forced to pass back to Marcelo after opting not to pass to the unmarked Benzema inside the area."
17',action,"Endo pops up down the right flank and cuts inside on to his left foot before attempting to take on Marcelo. He gets beyond the Brazilian just slightly in order to whip a deep cross to the back post, but Carvajal just manages to get there before the attacker can get the header on goal. It was a very tight angle anyway."
15',action,"Kashima's response has been admirable as they are showing plenty of energy going forward. However, they can't afford to pile too many men forward as Madrid are looking pretty dangerous on the counter, with Benzema very nearly going through on goal but for a vital interception from Yamamoto."
13',action,"Kroos pops a neat pass into the feet of Vazquez, who twists and turns on the edge of the area looking to find room to get the shot away. He eventually evades the attentions of the defence to have a crack on goal, but he was leaning back and the strike ends up being ballooned north of the crossbar."
11',action,"Kashima have responded very well to that Benzema goal and are looking to get back on level terms as quickly as possible. Nishi goes on a marauding run down the right-hand side and just gains a yard on Marcelo before smashing a cross into the penalty area, but Navas proactively comes off his line to claim."
9',action,"OGASAWARA! HOW CLOSE WAS THAT?! Kashima very nearly respond immediately to going a goal down as the captain of the Japanese side latches on to a loose ball around 30 yards out to drill a fantastic half-volley high towards the top corner. Navas struggles to get across, but is let-off as the attempt flashes north of the crossbar!"
8',goal,"Goal Karim Benzema. GOOOOOAAAAALLL! GOOOAAAALL FOR REAL MADRID! A perfect start for Los Blancos! A clearance falls nicely to Modric on the edge of the box, who smashes a superb volley back into the danger area which is palmed away by the goalkeeper. However, Benzema is there to pounce on the rebound and cushions a finish into the empty net. One-nil!"
5',action,"Madrid are trying to sustain possession in and around the midfield area but fair play to Kashima as the Japanese outfit are pressing very high up the park looking to pounce on any mistakes. Bags of energy from Antlers, but they wont be able to keep up this kind of tempo for an extended period."
3',action,"Neither side has settled into their passing game as of yet as the opening stages continue to be rather frantic. This is partly due to the Yokahama crowd who are creating a cracking atmosphere inside the Nissan Stadium, but you would reckon that Madrid will dominate sooner rather than later."
1',action,We are under way in Yokahama! Can Zidane's men claim another trophy?
,action,"The J League champions, Kashima Antlers, have had to work a bit harder than their opponents from the Spanish capital in order to make it to this stage. They have had to get through Auckland City, Mamelodi Sundowns, and Atletico Nacional to have the opportunity to take down the European giants, Madrid, in the final."
,action,Real Madrid made it to the final of the competition via the semi-final which took place on Thursday morning. Los Blancos took on Club America and secured a comfortable 2-0 victory thanks to goals from Benzema and Ronaldo.
