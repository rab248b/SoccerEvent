,action,"Juventus take a massive step towards the semi-finals as Paulo Dybala takes centre-stage with a stunning first-half brace, before Giorgio Chiellini added another after the break as the Bianconeri put in a flawless display to convincingly dispose of Barcelona in Turin. That's all for our live coverage, thanks for following along. Goodbye!"
90'+4',action,FULL-TIME: JUVENTUS 3-0 BARCELONA.
90'+3',action,"Juventus kill all sorts of time high up the pitch, playing down the flank in the final third. Sporting scenes as Mandzukic goes down with a cramp, bringing play to a halt, and instead of getting upset with the striker, his countryman Rakitic comes over to help him stretch it out. You always like to see that."
90'+1',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Mario Lemina. Lemina is also booked, appropriately."
90'+1',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Samuel Umtiti. Lemina dominates Umtiti in a physical duel, but the Barca centre-half goes into the book for his role in the altercation."
90',action,The board goes up to indicate an additional four minutes of stoppage-time.
89',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Miralem Pjanić sub-in Andrea Barzagli . One more pair of legs on hand in defence here for Juventus in these final minutes as sub-in Andrea Barzagli is brought on to help see out the clean sheet, with Pjanic the one replaced."
87',action,"A free-kick for Barcelona straight in the centre of the pitch, about 25 yards from goal, is wasted into the wall. Suarez pounces to keep it alive and does well to ride out Chiellini's challenge to win a corner. Now or never for Barca if they are going to find this away goal."
85',action,"Barcelona are camped out in the attacking half again, but there's absolutely no way through for them. Juventus are disciplined and focused as ever in defence, determined to see this out. Everywhere Barcelona look to go with the ball, there's a black and white shirt lurking."
83',action,"Pressure on the Juventus goal is relieved again as the hosts get up the pitch and win a corner. Barcelona only partially clear, and Juve have a free-kick moments later. Precious time being run off the clock here, if nothing else."
81',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Paulo Bruno Dybala sub-in Tomás Eduardo Rincón Hernández . Tomas Rincon enters the fray as Juventus' second change of the night, with Dybala replaced."
78',action,"Juventus are starting to drop a bit deeper now as Barcelona throw everything but the kitchen sink forward in an attempt to find the away goal they so desperately crave. With all due respect to PSG, Juventus are an entirely different animal defensively, so turning this around at the Camp Nou will be a seemingly insurmountable task without an away goal - but never say never, right?"
76',action,STAT: Juventus have conceded fewer goals in the Champions League this season than any of the other seven sides still left in the competition (2 in 8 games). Both of those goals came from set-piece.
74',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Sami Khedira. Khedira and the rest of his team think Juventus have a free-kick just outside the area, in the centre of the pitch, but their joy is short-lived as the midfielder is booked for simulation!"
73',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Juan Guillermo Cuadrado Bello sub-in Mario Lemina . Juventus make their first change of the night as sub-in Mario Lemina comes on to replace Cuadrado, who hasn't quite recovered from the earlier knock."
71',action,"Play comes to a halt at a poor time for Barcelona, just as they're starting to look a real threat, as Cuadrado goes down and requires attention from the medical staff. You cannot say enough about the work Cuadrado and Mandzukic have put in defensively on the flanks tonight."
69',action,"SHOULD THAT HAVE BEEN A PENALTY?! Surprisingly muted appeals from Barcelona, with Suarez the only one adamant, as his shot from the edge of the box strikes the arm of Chiellini. It looked a stone-cold penalty on first glance, but the replay shows it came off the face of the defender and onto the arm. Not sure how the referee spotted that, or if he did, but it's a terrific non-call regardless."
67',action,"HE'S MISSED IT! Well that really has been the difference tonight, hasn't it? Juventus have been clinical in front of goal, while Barcelona can't solve Buffon. Suarez is played through for easily his best, if not only, chance of the night, but Buffon gets the slightest of touches on his effort to steer it beyond the far post!"
65',action,"Tempers are rising and it only figures to get worse as the clock winds down, provided Barcelona can't solve this Juventus defence. On paper this scoreline looks bad, but one away goal for Barcelona would drastically change the shape of the tie, so it's shaping up to be a tense final 25 minutes."
63',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Mario Mandžukić. Mandzukic and Roberto clash as the physical nature of the match increases, and the Juventus striker is cautioned."
61',action,"STAT: Barcelona have conceded three goals in successive Champions League away matches for the first time since October 2000 (Besiktas, Milan)."
59',action,"Chiellini looked like he was going to bust out in tears after that goal. His celebration was one of pure, unbridled joy - and his sentiments were echoed throughout the team. Their focus and desire has not wavered from the opening kick-off and they are thoroughly deserving of this lead."
57',yellow-card,Yellow Card Andrés Iniesta Luján. Frustration clearly setting in here for Barcelona as Iniesta is booked now for a late foul on Pjanic.
55',assist,Assist Miralem Pjanić. Perfect corner from Pjanic who picks up the assist.
55',goal,"Goal Giorgio Chiellini. JUVENTUS RUNNING RIOT IN TURIN! Mascherano is inexplicably left marking Chiellini from a corner, and the Juventus centre-half makes the most of the height difference, getting onto the end of Pjanic's cross and placing a perfect header in off the far post!"
54',action,"SHOULD BE THREE! That really had to be in! Higuain springs the offside trap and finds himself through on goal. His first touch takes the pace out of the move, and his eventual shot is stopped by Ter Stegen, but Mandzukic was all alone at the far post begging for a pass to be made!"
53',yellow-card,Yellow Card Luis Alberto Suárez Díaz. Suarez is booked for a foul on his former team-mate Dani Alves.
53',action,"There's such a big gap between Barcelona's midfield and defence, offering up all sorts of space to Juventus on the break. Cuadrado springs forward and picks out Higuain atop the box, but his shot lacks the proper pace as Ter Stegen makes the save."
52',action,"They're getting closer! Suarez makes a nice run and is sprung through down the left. His flat cross nearly finds the head of Roberto, before the follow-up from Iniesta is lifted just over the bar! Signs of life from Barcelona."
50',action,"Defensively there may not be a sounder team in all of football in current form than Juventus with their full compliment. Combine that with the scoring prowess of Higuain and Dybala, and this is a club that should be right at the forefront of the conversation of Champions League contenders this season."
48',action,"INCHES WIDE! Expert piece of defending from Chiellini to slide in and knock the throughball away from Suarez, but Messi is there to pounce and bends a first-time effort wide of the far post! Buffon looks like he had it covered, though. Back the other way come Juventus and Khedira barely misses the target with an effort of his own! That was actually closer than Messi's attempt."
46',action,Juventus get the second half underway...
46',substitution,Substitution sub-out Jérémy Mathieu sub-in André Filipe Tavares Gomes . Andre Gomes replaces Mathieu at the interval.
,action,"A stunning brace from Paulo Dybala, who has completely outshined fellow countryman Lionel Messi, has Juventus comfortably ahead at the interval, at the end of a near-flawless first half from the Bianconeri. Still 135 minutes remaining in the tie, so they're far from through yet, but they have been impenetrable and clinical through the first 45."
45',action,HALF-TIME: JUVENTUS 2-0 BARCELONA.
44',action,"AWKWARD FROM TER STEGEN! Sandro is sprung down the left and he does well to pick out Higuain. The striker takes a touch to control and powers an effort at goal with his second. Ter Stegen parries it rather awkwardly, sending it straight into the danger area, but Mathieu is excellently positioned to see it behind for a corner."
42',action,Juventus have relieved the pressure on their defence here as they enjoy their first decent spell on the ball in some time. They're trying to slow the tempo down here and you can understand why. It would be an impossible ask of them to keep their work rate and intensity which they had through the opening 20 minutes.
40',action,"STAT: Barcelona are the top scorers in this season’s Champions League with 26 goals in eight games. Nine of those have come from set-piece, also the highest tally in this season’s competition."
38',action,"Juventus have all 10 shirts organised in two tidy lines of four and four, with Higuain and Dybala a bit higher up. They're very narrow in their defensive shape as well, which has created an awfully congested area in the centre of the pitch, from the top of the Juventus box to about 40 yards out from goal."
36',action,"Barcelona are dominating possession, but Juventus are putting in a defensive masterpiece off the ball. They aren't running like madmen trying to win it back, instead keeping their shape and holding Barca to the periphery, biding their time before looking to pounce on a mistake and win it back."
34',action,"Mandzukic does really well to fend off Messi and see the ball behind for a goal-kick. The Argentine takes exception to this, but what exactly he's upset about is unclear as it was perfectly fair and clean. Mandzukic offers his hand to make amends, but Messi is having none of it, before knocking it away off the back of his neck. Frustration setting in, surely."
32',action,"Juventus have looked like world beaters through the opening 30 minutes of this tie. Barcelona started equally poor in the first leg of their tie against PSG, going on to lose it 4-0, but even there they weren't down 2-0 until late in the first half. This could wind up being a similar result if Barca can't figure it out."
30',action,STAT: Paulo Dybala's goal (after 6 mins 34 seconds) was the fastest conceded by Barcelona this season in all competitions.
28',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Daniel Alves da Silva. Well that was coming. Dani Alves commits his fourth foul of the night, this one on Iniesta, and he's deservedly booked for his overaggressive start."
26',action,The noise in this stadium is incredible. Just incredible. It's such a hostile atmosphere here in Turin and you can see how it's fueling these Juventus players. The hosts are chasing down every ball and winning the 50-50 battles. Allegri couldn't have dreamt up a better 25 minutes.
24',action,"Dani Alves commits his third foul of the night here and you have to imagine he's nearing a booking. This is Alves' first time facing his former club since departing this summer, and he's perhaps a bit overzealous as a result."
22',goal,"Goal Paulo Bruno Dybala. DYBALA STAMPS HIS NAME ON THE TIE! There's an Argentine stealing the show in Turin, and it's not Messi! Dybala holds his run to latch onto Mandzukic's excellent pull-back atop the box, and he powers an absolutely marvelous first-time strike into the bottom corner! What an incredible start from the ex-Palermo man!"
21',action,"HOW ABOUT THAT FOR A SAVE?! My word! It all starts with a stunningly incisive throughball from Messi to Iniesta, who times his run perfectly. The midfielder only has the keeper to beat, but Buffon reacts incredibly to stick out a hand and deflect it wide - and you can see from his celebration just what that means to him!"
19',action,"STAT: Juventus and Barcelona’s last encounter was in the 2015 Champions League final, the latter winning 3-1 in Berlin. However, the Catalans have yet to beat Juventus on their own soil in European competition (D2 L2)."
17',action,"Higuain holds the ball up well, showing good strength up against the very physical Mascherano. He can't control the ball as it's poked free, but Mandzukic comes in to collect. The Croatian forward unleashes a speculative effort and doesn't make the best contact with the ball, rolling an effort safely into the hands of Ter Stegen."
15',action,"Plenty of possession now for Barcelona as they have done well to settle down after conceding the early goal. They're not posing much of a threat from open play just yet, but you have to figure if this possession trend continues, the chances will follow."
13',action,"Messi is brought down just outside the penalty area, setting up Barcelona with a great chance from the free-kick. Suarez snuck in to dispossess Chiellini from behind and the centre-half then fouled Messi in his attempt to win it back. The ensuing attempt from the Argentine is poor, however, as his cross-cum-shot sails wide of the far post."
11',action,"Barcelona respond well to falling behind, enjoying their first decent spell in the attacking half. It's all very contemplative from the visitors though, with Juventus very comfortable in containing them for the time being."
9',action,"STAT: Juventus have won their last four games in the Champions League, the current longest run in the competition. They are the only unbeaten team this season alongside Real Madrid."
7',assist,Assist Juan Guillermo Cuadrado Bello. Lovely skill on the ball from Cuadrado to get into the area and tee up Dybala for the strike.
7',goal,"Goal Paulo Bruno Dybala. BARCELONA CARVED OPEN AND JUVENTUS HAVE THE LEAD! The Bianconeri start brilliantly and they have their goal to show for it! Cuadrado dazzles his way into the are and lays off for Dybala, who opens up and bends a stunning finish at the far post! Ter Stegen at full stretch, but he can't get anywhere near it!"
5',action,"Barcelona incredibly unstable in these early minutes, as Juventus have been far and above the better side thus far. Ter Stegen is too relaxed with the ball at his feet, putting his side under unnecessary pressure, but they're just able to get the ball clear."
3',action,"GLORIOUS CHANCE! What on earth was going on with Barcelona's defence?! Higuain is left unmarked in the centre to latch onto the end of the free-kick, but he heads straight at Ter Stegen!"
2',action,"Impressive start from Juventus as they press high up the pitch, leading to an early shot for Khedira which misses the target. Moments later the hosts are back in attack and Dybala wins a free-kick in a dangerous position on the left as he's tripped up by Iniesta."
1',action,"AND THEY'RE OFF! An absolutely deafening atmosphere in Turin as Barcelona get the game underway, attacking right to left."
,action,"Luis Enrique makes a pair of changes as well from that historic victory over PSG. Sergi Roberto, who scored the decisive goal in stoppage-time, is rewarded with a start ahead of Rafinha, while Jeremy Mathieu comes into defence, pushing Javier Mascherano into midfield to replace the suspended Sergio Busquets. Lionel Messi starts atop a midfield diamond in a number 10 role."
,action,"Massimiliano Allegri makes two changes from the second leg against Porto. Giorgio Chiellini is back in defence, with Medhi Benatia dropped from the matchday squad, while Miralem Pjanic gets the nod in midfield ahead of Claudio Marchisio."
,action,"SUBS: D. Suarez, Cillessen, Alcacer, Alba, Digne, Gomes, Alena."
,action,"BARCELONA (3-4-3): Ter Stegen; Pique, Umtiti, Mathieu; Rakitic, Mascherano, Messi, Iniesta; Roberto, Neymar, Suarez."
