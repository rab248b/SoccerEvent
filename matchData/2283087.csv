,action,"FULL-TIME! Atletico Madrid drop two points on the road, with Athletic Club managing to hold Simeone's side to a 2-2 draw. Goals from Lekue and Williams overtturned an opening strike from Koke, before a wonder goal from Griezmann tied things up late on. The away team's good form comes to an end, with Los Leones continuing to scrape results. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+3',yellow-card,Yellow Card José María Giménez de Vargas. Gimenez picks up a late booking.
90'+2',action,"Saul manages to shoot on the half-volley on the edge of the penalty area, but the Spain international's shot is placed too close to Iraizoz. Athletic Club are happy to slow the play down and keep the bulk of their players behind the ball at this point."
90',action,There are three minutes of stoppage time.
89',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Ander Iturraspe Derteano sub-in Mikel Rico Moreno . Mikel Rico is introduced for the last few minutes, with Iturraspe taking his leave."
87',action,"Correa tries to shoot from a tight angle on the right-hand side, but the ball is deflected behind for a corner. The referee has to halt play for some pushing between Saul and Raul Garcia, before a second delivery from Koke is blocked by Garcia."
85',action,"Only five minutes remain for the away side to turn this one around, with Athletic Club still edging forward. Lekue and Villalibre combine on the edge of the penalty area, but Correa tracks right the way back to defuse the situation."
83',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Iker Muniain Goñi sub-in Markel Susaeta Laskurain . Susaeta is introduced for the home side, with Muniain replaced after a bright performance."
83',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Iñaki Williams Arthuer sub-in Asier Villalibre Molina . Williams takes his leave after a quiet second half, with Villalibre given a chance to make himself a hero."
82',action,"Iturraspe delivers a free-kick from the right-hand side, but Filipe Luis manages to get the ball away from the awaiting presence of Raul Garcia. This game is set up in exciting fashion. Gaitan races down the left, but an awful cross from the Argentine winger is gobbled up by Iraizoz."
80',assist,"Assist Fernando José Torres Sanz. Torres lays off a simple pass to his striker partner, and Griezmann does the rest!"
80',goal,"Goal Antoine Griezmann. GOOOOOOOOAL! GREAT GOAL FROM GRIEZMANN! Atletico are level! The former Real Sociedad man is allowed to jink onto his left foot from range, and drills an unstoppable effort into the bottom-left corner. Iraizoz couldn't get done quick enough. What an unbelievable effort!"
80',goal,Goal Antoine Griezmann. Goal Antoine Griezmann
78',action,"Filipe Luis drives to the left byline, but a poor cross from the Brazil international is cleared out for a throw-in on the near side. Athletic Club are defending their penalty area well, with Griezmann and Torres not having any pockets of space to exploit. An equaliser isn't looking particularly likely."
76',action,"Wide from Correa! The substitute is afforded some space on the edge of the penalty area, but can only drill the ball shy of the right-hand post. Atletico are getting closer, but this contest is still incredibly open. Athletic Club definitely have the measure of the away side."
75',action,"Griezmann bursts into the clear and clips home a beautiful finish, but can only look over to the sideline to see the linesman's flag raised for offside. Athletic Club respond with an attack of their own, with Lekue invited down the left. He picks out Raul Garcia at the back post, who knocks the ball down, but Atletico clear."
73',action,"Muniain wriggles his way through a few opponents in the middle of midfield, bursting his way into a shooting position. He unleashes a low drive, which Moya has to get down well to smother, and the home fans sound their appreciation. He is looking in great shape. Lekue crosses from the left, moments later, but Gimenez clears."
71',action,"Muniain lifts a cross in from the left byline, but his cross sails over the danger area and wide of the target. Only 20 minutes are left for Atletico to try and build a comeback, but Torres' introduction is yet to have any discernible effect on proceedings."
69',action,"Muniain tries to scamper forward, with Balenziaga combining with Lekue down the left-hand side. Correa tracks back, but Gimenez comes across in uncompromising fashion to take back possession and clear. Athletic Club are still breaking forward when they can."
67',action,"There is a brief stoppage in play, as Iturraspe goes down with a head injury - he has been in the wars today. Atletico are now the team needing to take the game by the scruff of the neck and push forward, but Valverde's men are content to sit back and absorb plenty of pressure."
65',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Kevin Gameiro sub-in Ángel Martín Correa . Gameiro takes his leave after a quiet outing, with Correa coming into the game for the last 25 minutes or so."
65',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Yannick Ferreira Carrasco sub-in Osvaldo Nicolás Fabián Gaitán . Carrasco is replaced by Gaitain out on the left-hand side, as Atletico look for an equaliser."
64',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Yannick Ferreira Carrasco. Carrasco has a free-kick effort from just outside the Athletic Club penalty box, but the Belgium international dips a powerful attempt just shy of the left-hand post. He then receives a yellow card for arguing with the referee over the wall having clearly deflected his shot wide."
63',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ander Iturraspe Derteano. Iturraspe gets a booked, while limping off the field of play, but the Spaniard have been helped off under his own steam. There is definitely some kind of problem with his knee."
62',action,"Iturraspe slides in to stop Saul on the edge of the penalty area, fouling the Atletico midfielder, but the hosts' midfielder appears to have come off much worse. His knee appeared to buckle, and his body language looks like that of a man who knows he is injured yet again."
60',action,"Filipe Luis wins a corner on the left-hand side for Simeone's men, with Koke bending it in. Raul Garcia rises well at the near post, however, to nod clear against his former club - before conceding another corner. This time, Iraizoz is able to claim the ball confidently."
58',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Gabriel Fernández Arenas sub-in Fernando José Torres Sanz . The booked Gabi is replaced by Torres, which should mean that there is an immediate change of approach from the away side."
56',assist,"Assist Raúl García Escudero. Raul Garcia turns provider, bending a great cross in from the right-hand side."
56',goal,"Goal Óscar de Marcos Arana. GOOOOOOAL! ATHLETIC CLUB TAKE THE LEAD! Williams takes a poor first touch, which enables Godin to stride out of defence and tackle the young forward. Raul Garcia bursts down the right and whips in a good cross, which sees De Marcos nod home from close-range! He popped up unexpectedly!"
54',action,"Griezmann is almost picked out by a looping delivery into the penalty area, but the loose ball falls to Iraizoz, who hoofs clear due to uncertainty about whether he could pick it up or not. Gameiro is released into the box moments later, and angles a cross towards the back post, but Carrasco rises well only to head over!"
53',action,"Koke opens play out to the left-hand side, with Carrasco combining with Filipe Luis well. The ball finds Saul, who bursts to the byline, but Boveda shuffles across well to make a good clearance. Atletico come forward again, this time down the right, but Vrsaljko's delivery is poor."
51',action,"The hosts are continuing to see more of the ball, with no changes being made to personnel or approaches during the early stages of this second half. Iraizoz continues to show a fair amount of inconsistency with the quality of his kicking, as San Jose is required to improvise with a flick-on deep inside his own half."
49',action,"Atletico win a free-kick on the right-hand side, with the referee having to be very busy this afternoon. The hosts whip the dead-ball into the penalty area, but Gimenez nods a header straight down Iraizoz's throat."
47',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Gabriel Fernández Arenas. Gabi picks up the first yellow card of the second half, with the Atletico captain booked for a cynical tug on Muniain."
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half in Bilbao! These two teams are level, with Athletic Club hoping to have momentum on their side after Lekue's equaliser just before the break. Simeone's men might need to find another gear to sink Los Leones."
,action,"HALF-TIME! There isn't any time added on, with both teams heading down the tunnel level. Koke opened the scoring very early on, with Lekue coming up with a thunderbolt late in the half to tie things up. Atletico have been playing on the counter and look a threat, but Los Leones have done quite well considering they fell behind."
44',action,"The home fans are making plenty of noise and the hosts' tails are up, but Atletico win a free-kick in a deep area. Gimenez wins the first ball, flicking it into the box, but Athletic Club hoof clear. This game is going to be poised very interestingly for the second half."
42',assist,"Assist Iñaki Williams Arthuer. Williams cuts a low pass to the edge of the penalty area, finding Lekue in a little pocket of space."
42',goal,"Goal Íñigo Lekue Martínez. GOOOOOOOOOAL! LEKUE MAKES IT 1-1! The young man cuts in from the left, after being found by a low pass just inside the box. He jinks onto his right foot and thunders a wonderful finish into the top-right corner. Great finish!"
40',action,"Filipe Luis makes another good interception inside his own box, with Atletico's back four doing well in the air. The absence of Aduriz is bound to be evident, in this sense. Athletic Club try to open play out to the right, but lose possession, with the hosts making a lot of misplaced passes while attempting to force the issue."
38',action,"Gimenez is happy to launch a long clearance upfield, as anywhere will do for Atletico at the moment. They are spending the minimum time necessary holding possession inside their own half, preferring to instead feed a spring-loaded attack. A few fouls are starting to break up play, as Athletic Club's frustrations are showing."
36',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Iñaki Williams Arthuer. Williams gets a yellow card for catching Godin slightly late, with Athletic Club's players surrounding the referee due to a spate of otehr niggling fouls that haven't been given in favour of the young forward."
36',action,"Less than 10 minutes remain until the break, and Valverde will be hoping that his players can manage to test Moya again before then - as the Atletico goalkeeper has look rather jittery. Williams is released down the right flank for the hosts, but Godin beats him to the pass."
34',action,"Lekue tries to bend a cross in from the left-hand side, but it is cleared with ease, with Athletic Club continuing to dominate the ball without creating anything of note. Atletico are constantly on high alert, preying on even the smallest of mistakes in order to burst upfield in just a few passes."
32',action,"San Jose breaks up play well, before feeding a pass forward to Muniain, with the young Spaniard doing brilliantly to hold off a few opponents. Gabi is all over him, tugging on his shirt, with Godin then giving him a push too. No free-kick is given, and the home players can't believe it!"
30',action,"Wide from Carrasco! The away side counter brilliantly, with the Belgian fed down the left-hand side by Griezmann. The ex-Monaco wide man bursts into the penalty area, before dragging a shot a long way wide of the far post."
28',action,"Griezmann tries to play a pass in behind the Athletic Club defence for Gameiro to chase, but Laporte cuts it out well. Atletico quickly drop deep again, with their front two tucking right back towards the half-way line. Simeone isn't prepared to make a foolish mistake like their opponents managed to."
26',action,"Iturraspe bends a free-kick in from the right-hand side for the hosts, but Moya flies out to try and punch the delivery clear once again. Atletico respond with a drive down the right, but San Jose drops back to cover across and clear the danger. Clear-cut chances are proving elusive."
24',action,"The home side are retaining possession and working the ball well, but Atletico's rigid two banks of four aren't being broken with any regularity. Counter-attacking is the preferred method for both of these teams, but Athletic Club are doing well to keep reasonable control of this game."
22',action,"Williams is the target of another long ball into the box, but Filipe Luis clears Atletico's lines well. The away side break down the right, with Carrasco combining well with Vrsaljko, but Simeone's men are happy to take their time. A throughball looks for the Belgian on the overlap, but Lekue intercepts."
20',action,"Williams is looking very frustrated in this first half, with the young forward already getting in the referee's ear on two occasions. He will have to be careful. This game is very open indeed, with Athletic Club doing well to create a few half-chances."
18',action,"Carrasco bends in a free-kick delivery from deep on the left-hand side, with Atletico threatening again from a dead-ball situation. Godin threatens to meet it, but the ball bounces up into Iraizoz's grasp. Athletic Club head up the other end, with Raul Garcia shooting from long-range, and Moya spills a simple save just around his post!"
16',action,"Muniain has been at the centre of everything so far for Athletic Club, with the diminutive forward slipping some incisive passes into dangerous areas. Atletico, however, have defended well, with Vrsaljko and Filipe Luis not allowing much joy. Valverde will be pleased by his team's response to going behind."
14',action,"Yet again, Atletico look to go long quickly, with Gameiro the target of a searching ball forward. Fortunately for Athletic Club, Iraizoz is quick off his line to clear. The hosts manage to find De Marcos on the right, as Muniain does brilliantly, but a cross from the full-back can't be turned home by Williams - Moya gets in his face well."
12',action,"Gameiro races down the right-hand side and wriggles away from Laporte, before slotting a pass into Koke. The Spaniard tries to put the ball back into his team-mate's path, but his idea doesn't quite come to fruition."
11',action,"Balenziaga is released down the left-hand side, but his cross is poor, with the clearance falling to San Jose. The Spain international takes aim from long-range, but a tame effort rattles into a ruck of bodies. Moments later, De Marcos tries to scamper down the right, but Filipe Luis makes a good tackle."
9',action,"Muniain opens the ball out to the right-hand side, with a cross being whipped in by De Marcos. In the opening stages, Lekue is playing out on the left wing, rather than at right-back. Atletico are holding back and being rather conservative with their build-up play."
7',action,"Athletic Club are being allowed to see more of the ball in the opening exchanges, with Atletico happy to sit deeper and then break at pace. Simeone's men have looked comfortably, holding the hosts at arm's length throughout these early minutes."
5',action,"Balenziaga gets down the left and bends in a good cross from the left, but Moya is off his line well to punch clear. Koke mops up the scraps. It has been a really bright start in this game, but the home fans haven't taken too kindly to conceding in such soft fashion early on."
3',assist,"Assist Filipe Luis Kasmirski. Filipe Luis cuts back an easy pass to his team-mate, who does the rest."
3',goal,"Goal Jorge Resurrección Merodio. GOOOOOOOOOAL! KOKE MAKES IT 1-0! The midfielder cuts in from the left-hand side, before trying to whip in a cross-cum-shot from out wide. His right-footed delivery curls into the box, skips off the turf, before nestling in the far corner. Griezmann's presence unsighted Iraizoz!"
2',action,"Iraizoz almost gives possession away to Griezmann, with a terrible pass out from the back, but fortunately for the goalkeeper, Iturraspe gets back to ensure that Gameiro can't be found with a neat pass. Nervy start!"
1',action,"We are underway in the first half in the Basque Country! Athletic Club will be hoping to end a dismal recent run, but in order to do so they must deal with a resurgent Atletico. Benat and Aduriz's absences could be hard felt, but Simeone won't mind as long as the visitors win."
