,action,"FULL-TIME! Barcelona wrap up an easy 5-0 victory over Celta Vigo, courtesy of goals from Messi, Neymar, Rakitic and Umtiti, which temporarily takes them back to the top of the LaLiga pile due to Real Madrid having played a game less. The visitors weren't at the races at all, with the hosts looking to be in good shape heading into their Champions League second leg tie against PSG. That's all that we have time for, we hope to see you again next time."
90'+2',action,"Sisto drops a shoulder and tries to drill in a cross from the right-hand side, but Ter Stegen is able to smother the ball with ease. The Germany international has had absolutely nothing taxing to do this evening."
90'+1',action,There are three minutes of stoppage time at Camp Nou.
90',action,"Denis has a chance to try his luck with his head from close range, after great work down the right-hand side, but Sergio Alvarez makes a simple save. Celta head down the other end, with Aspas wriggling beyond Pique, but the Spaniard eventually shoots wide of the bottom-left corner."
88',action,"Beautiful play from Barcelona! Some one-touch stuff at the edge of the penalty area threatens to find Suarez in space in the box, but the final ball just zips beyond the Uruguayan's reach. Camp Nou sounds its appreciation."
86',action,"Suarez is found out on the right-hand side, but a low pass towards Messi is cut out by Sergi Gomez. The home side are retaining the ball and stroking it around casually, running down the clock with relative ease. Celta have been complete pushovers."
84',action,"Aspas dribbles into the Barcelona penalty area and wrongfoots Pique with a neat piece of skill, but Alba recovers to bail out his teammate and stab a low pass back to Ter Stegen. It has been a case of so close but yet so far for Celta all evening."
82',action,"Wide from Suarez! The ex-Liverpool striker manages to skip into the clear and get into the penalty area. Sergio Alvarez narrows what is already a tight angle, which forces the Barcelona forward to drag a low shot just shy of the far post. Denis couldn't get there quickly enough to tap it home from close-range."
80',action,"Celta earn themselves a free-kick within shooting distance, and Aspas tries his luck. The Spain international takes aim with his left foot, but sends an absolutely awful effort miles over the crossbar. That pretty much sums up Berizzo's men's night."
78',action,"Barcelona are camped in Celta's half and continue to lay siege to their opponent's box, with Pique treating this as a game of futsal at this point of proceedings. The away side try to play their way upfield with some one-touch passing, but a ball forward towards Sisto is cut out expertly by Umtiti. Calmness personified from the French defender yet again tonight."
76',action,"Suarez flicks a ball around the corner for Messi, who races into the clear. The Argentine tries to pick out his strike partner square across the box, who isn't on the scoresheet yet tonight, but his pass is cut out by Sergi Gomez. The centre-back clears behind for a corner, which comes to absolutely nothing."
74',action,"The tempo of this game has really taken a nose-dive now, with Celta not having any incisiveness on the break at all. They seem to think that the game is lost, with their efforts to be better spent on damage limitation for the last quarter of an hour at Camp Nou."
72',action,"The visiting players would probably like the referee to end the game now, as it appears that Barcelona are only going to go on to make this scoreline all the more embarrassing. Luis Enrique's men retain possession with ease, with even a consolation goal not appearing to be in the offing for Celta."
70',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Neymar da Silva Santos Junior sub-in Denis Suárez Fernández . Neymar is given a rest, with Denis getting a run-out on the left for 20 minutes or so."
69',action,"Celta are sat deep and absorbing pressure, with the lack of Guidetti's presence up top not giving them an easy out-ball. Barcelona are just pushing on looking for more goals, as they look to get into the groove ahead of their make-or-break Champions League second leg against PSG."
68',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Daniel Wass sub-in Marcelo Alfonso Díaz Rojas . Marcelo Diaz replaces Wass in midfield for the dying stages, after failing to offer much going forward."
67',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Sergi Roberto Carnicer sub-in Andrés Iniesta Luján . Iniesta is introduced for the last 20 minutes or so, with Sergi Roberto taking his leave. Mascherano has dropped deeper, with Rafinha playing wide on the right-hand side."
66',action,"Neymar is given some space to gallop into down the left-hand side, with the Brazil international now showing a few bits of showboating. He looks to bend in a cross, but Cabral hacks it clear on the volley. Celta respond with a break, finding Wass in space on the edge of the box, but the Danish midfielder shoots narrowly wide of the top-left corner."
64',goal,"Goal Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini. GOOOOOOOOOAL! IT'S FIVE! After Aspas misses a great chance down the other end, Messi does the honours for Barcelona. Sergio Alvarez is unsighted, allowing for the Argentina international to cut in from the right and slam a low finish inside the near post. Great stuff again from the acting Blaugrana captain."
62',substitution,"Substitution sub-out John Guidetti sub-in Jozabed Sánchez Ruiz . Guidetti is replaced by Jozabed for the last half an hour or so. Aspas goes up top for the away side, with the substitute threatening to offer a little more craft in the final third."
61',assist,Assist Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini. Messi is found in a pocket of space and puts a ball into the box that Umtiti would find it harder to miss than score from.
61',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Sergio Busquets i Burgos sub-in Javier Alejandro Mascherano . Mascherano comes into the game for Busquets, with the Argentine set to sit deep in the hosts' midfield three."
61',goal,"Goal Samuel Umtiti. GOOOOOOOOOAL! UMTITI MAKES IT 4-0! A corner is taken short, with Messi allowed to approach the penalty area cautiously. The Argentine slots an inviting ball to the edge of the six-yard box, with the French defender nipping in ahead of Pique to fire home his first ever LaLiga goal."
59',action,"Barcelona are happy to sit back for a moment and take a breather, as a three-goal lead should be more than enough to earn them three points tonight. Celta aren't even showing any signs of getting back into this contest. Berizzo should probably freshen things up with Guidetti, as the ex-Manchester City man isn't getting any change at all out of Umtiti."
57',goal,"Goal Ivan Rakitić. GOOOOOOOOOAL! RAKITIC MAKES IT THREE! Guidetti just can't seem to get the ball to stick, with Umtiti proving to be the man to frustrate the Swede constantly. Barcelona come forward as a result, with Messi fizzing a low pass into the penalty area. A loose touch from Rafinha falls to the Croatia international and he fires home - but he's so clearly offside."
57',assist,Assist Rafael Alcântara do Nascimento. Assist Rafael Alcântara do Nascimento
55',action,"Messi and Neymar are still proving to be complete nuisances, with Celta's players needing to be much more careful now that the referee has dished out a few yellow cards. Luis Enrique will be pleased that Barcelona have stayed in control and not allowed their opponents to get back into the game early in the second half."
53',action,"Celta are unable to press Barcelona effectively, with the hosts wriggling upfield with relative ease. Aspas tries to play a throughball into the clear for Guidetti to chase, but the weight of the pass is terrible and allows Ter Stegen to come out and collect with ease. Berizzo's system isn't giving the Swedish forward much support in the right areas."
51',substitution,Substitution sub-out Théo Bongonda Mbul'Ofeko Batombo sub-in Pione Sisto Ifolo Emirmija . Bongonda is replaced by Sisto on the left-hand side after a very quiet performance.
50',action,"Great run from Sergi Roberto! The right-back drives infield from the flank and just keeps going, eventually bursting into the penalty area. Sergio Alvarez comes out to meet him and a poor touch from the Barcelona man plays into the goalkeeper's hands. Moments later, Messi picks out Pique at the back post, but Sergi Gomez makes a great tackle to deny the Spain international."
49',yellow-card,Yellow Card Sergi Gómez Solà. Sergi Gomez gets a yellow card for clearing Neymar's legs out from underneath him.
48',action,"Celta are still persisting with playing long balls up to Guidetti, but Umtiti is doing fairly well aerially again the ex-Feyenoord striker. The away side just can't seem to create anything, with Barcelona defending excellently."
46',action,"We are back underway in the second half at Camp Nou! Barcelona hold a commanding lead over Celta, but Berizzo will presumably have had some truths to tell in the dressing room at the break. We could see a second-half resurgence, but the hosts have looked great so far."
,action,"HALF-TIME! Barcelona head into the interval with a comfortable 2-0 lead over Celta, courtesy of goals from Messi and Neymar. Suarez has hit the post too, in a half which the visitors have come off terribly. Berizzo will need to change something drastically, as his players haven't been any match for a Blaugrana side that look in the mood for more goals."
44',action,"The home side continue to look in the mood, with Busquets in particular showing signs of improvement. Celta open the ball out to the right-hand side, with Mallo linking up with Aspas. The two combine, but a return pass from the Spanish international striker heads out for a throw-in. Disappointing."
42',action,"Celta threaten down the left, with a cross from out wide narrowly missed by Guidetti in the penalty area! The visitors need a goal before the break, it would be wonders for their confidence after a terrible first half where they have been clearly second-best."
40',assist,"Assist Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini. Messi is involved once again, and this time unlocks the Celta defence with a crisp pass."
40',goal,"Goal Neymar da Silva Santos Junior. GOOOOOOOAL! NEYMAR MAKES IT 2-0! Sergi Roberto almost makes a mistake, miscuing a clearance badly, but Bongonda doesn't quite have the pace to get beyond the Spanish full-back and bear down on goal. Messi and Rakitic play a one-two to get Barcelona upfield, before the Argentine forward finds Neymar in behind Sergi Gomez. He calmly dinks a close-range chip over Sergio Alvarez!"
38',yellow-card,Yellow Card Nemanja Radoja. Radoja gets a yellow card for manhandling Neymar to the ground as the ex-Santos wide man looked to break forward at pace.
38',action,"Messi fires over the crossbar from a free-kick that was definitely within shooting range, and that was a waste of a good opportunity to test Sergio Alvarez. Celta are struggling to get upfield and create anything. Aspas gets to the right byline and then tries to stab a low pass into Guidetti's feet, but Busquets is there to intercept."
36',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Gustavo Daniel Cabral Cáceres. Cabral gets a yellow card for coming through the back of Suarez, although there didn't appear to be a lot in it from the Celta centre-back."
35',action,"Rafinha is found in lots of space down the right-hand side, before twisting and turning his way into the box. The Brazilian manages to skip beyond Jonny, who slips on the turf, but can only direct a tame shot straight down Sergio Alvarez's throat. Messi and Neymar look very disappointed in their teammate's selfishness there."
33',action,"The hosts continue to retain possession well, with Celta sitting very deep to absorb pressure and to avoid giving Suarez space in behind to attack. A bright start has since seen the away side lose their way entirely in this contest. Ter Stegen has been a spectator for a long while now, and just has to watch as a long-range pass from Roncaglia skips straight behind for a Barcelona goal-kick."
31',action,"Neymar is still causing all kinds of problems for the away side, with the Brazilian roaming around in the final third with a desire to beat players. The home fans are loving this first-half performance, Barcelona are really enjoying themselves at the moment and it shows. Messi tries his luck from the edge of the area, but it is blocked."
29',action,"Guidetti just can't seem to take a good first touch at the moment, with the Swedish target man giving possession away far too regularly. Aspas drops a shoulder and tries to whip in a cross from the right flank, but Alba tracks back and makes a neat tackle. Celta just can't seem to create anything dangerous, with another Mallo cross nodded to safety by Umtiti."
27',action,"Guidetti gifts possession away, leading to Neymar racing down the left-hand side. He drifts infield and beats two players, before the move continues. Messi exchanges the ball with the Brazilian, before finding Rafinha out on the right, but a powerful shot from the ex-Celta midfielder is deflected over the crossbar for a corner."
26',action,"Barcelona have their tails up now, with Celta needing to approach the next 10 minutes or so very carefully. Suarez tries to stab a pass into the box for Messi, and the goalscorer flicks the ball around the corner for Rafinha to chase, but Sergio Alvarez smothers it. The away side are struggling to hold onto possession."
24',goal,"Goal Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini. GOOOOOOOOOAL! MESSI BREAKS THE DEADLOCK! Suarez just peels off to one side, allowing for the Argentine forward to do it all himself. He turns Roncaglia and then approaches the penalty area at pace, before curling a lovely left-footed finish into the bottom corner of the net. Sergio Alvarez had no chance."
24',assist,"Assist Sergio Busquets i Burgos. Busquets plays a simple pass into Messi, before the Argentina international goes on a trademark dribbling run."
23',action,"Neymar dances beyond two players, before finding Messi's feet. The Argentine star clips a diagonal pass over the top for Suarez, but Sergio Alvarez is alert to the danger and rushes out to claim. Moments later, Neymar goes down in the box claiming for a penalty, but a sliding challenge from Mallo is adjudged to have got the ball. That looked rather rough."
22',action,"Just wide from Roncaglia! A free-kick delivery from Wass isn't dealt with well by Barcelona, with Umtiti eventually scuffing a clearance into the path of the ex-Fiorentina defender. Off-balance, the Argentine tries to shoot from 10 yards out, but he can only steer the ball beyond the far upright."
20',yellow-card,Yellow Card Sergio Busquets i Burgos. Busquets gets a yellow card for bringing down Bongonda in a dangerous area of the field.
20',action,"OFF THE POST! Suarez drives forward with real pace, before nutmegging Cabral and bursting into the clear. With Sergio Alvarez at his mercy, the Barcelona striker hits the woodwork with a right-footed effort, before Messi rockets the rebound onto the same right-hand upright again! They're getting closer."
18',action,"This game has been fairly even so far, with both teams having little spells of pressure. Messi finds Neymar out on the left, before Rakitic is found overlapping to the byline. The Croatian's cut-back is deflected behind for a corner - but the set piece comes to absolutely nothing."
17',action,"Aspas is released down the right, before linking up with Guidetti. The Swedish striker tees up Mallo out wide on the right, but a cross from the Celta captain is caught easily at the near post by Ter Stegen. Routine stuff for the German shot-stopper. Moments later, the visitors look for Bongonda over the top, but the winger is caught offside."
15',action,"Neymar drifts in from the left-hand side and bursts beyond Cabral with an injection of pace, with Sergio Alvarez coming off his line to narrow the angle. The Brazil international aims to clip a delicate finish into the back of the net, but his attempt sails a fair way beyond the back post. Audacious stuff!"
14',action,"Neymar and Messi link up brilliantly on the edge of the Celta box, playing consecutive one-twos, but a low shot from the latter is saved quite easily by Sergio Alvarez. The visiting goalkeeper spills the initial effort, but pounces on the rebound quickly. A first sight of goal in this game!"
12',action,"The away side are sat quite deep, with Sergi Gomez required to climb above Suarez to win an easy header. Barcelona are seeing more of the ball and patiently work it from side to side, but neither goalkeeper has had anything to do quite yet. Neymar manages to win yet another corner on the left, and looks to be a real danger, but his set-piece delivery is cleared by Jonny."
10',action,"Barcelona are happy to settle down and retain possession, with Celta already getting a little frustrated when they are penalised for niggling fouls. Messi tries to slide a throughball into the path of the overlapping Sergi Roberto, but Celta clear their lines. The hosts are feeling their way into this one carefully."
8',action,"Neymar races down the left-hand side and shakes off Mallo with ease, but a low cross from the Brazilian is hacked behind for a corner by Sergi Gomez. The hosts go short with their set piece, with Messi eventually released to the byline by Neymar. He tries to speed forward and cut back a cross, but the pass is slightly too heavy. Goal-kick."
7',action,"Celta are being forced to kick long quite regularly due to high pressure from Barcelona. Messi feeds Rafinha down the right-hand side, before the Brazil international plays a pass into the path of Suarez, but the Uruguayan forward is muscled off the ball by Cabral quite easily. It runs behind for a visiting goal-kick."
5',action,"Bongonda tries to burst down the left-hand side and beyond Sergi Roberto, with the Belgian definitely having a pace advantage over the Spanish right-back. Berizzo will be pleased with how his side have fared so far, as they have been happy to give as good as they've got. Guidetti tries to pick out Aspas on the edge of the box, but Umtiti intercepts easily."
3',action,"A couple of early fouls break up the flow of play, with Neymar and Cabral taking it in turns to be fouled in innocuous comings together. Celta are trying to hold the ball and ask a few early questions of their opponents, but the referee will have to keep an eye on things. Roncaglia in particular is already looking feisty."
1',action,"We are underway in the first half at Camp Nou! Barcelona need to turn in another good performance, as they bid to keep the pressure cranked up on Real Madrid in LaLiga, but Celta are always able to put in a competitive showing against Blaugrana."

,action,"TEAM NEWS: Andreu Fontas is out due to suspension, with Sergi Gomez expected to partner Gustavo Cabral at centre-back for Celta. Facundo Roncaglia is back from his own ban and could step up into defensive midfield alongside Nemanja Radoja. John Guidetti leads the line, with Theo Bongonda and Iago Aspas on the flanks, allowing Daniel Wass to replace the injured Pablo Hernandez in the number 10 role. Eduardo Berizzo could well change to a back five if required."

,action,"Barcelona have conceded in four of their last five league clashes at Camp Nou, and will be coming into this clash high on confidence after smashing Sporting Gijon 6-1 recently. Celta, meanwhile, have struggled away from home of late in LaLiga, taking just four points from their last available 15 on their travels."
