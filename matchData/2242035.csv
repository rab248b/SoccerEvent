,action,"It was a slightly nervy end to the game for Hull, but they nonetheless leave with three well-earned and well-deserved points. They were certainly the better of the two sides after suffering a slightly slow start to the game, with Swansea struggling to carve out many chances in front of goal, particularly after Llorente was forced off at the end of the first half."
,action,FULL-TIME: HULL CITY 2-1 SWANSEA CITY
90'+3',action,"Swansea desperately throw plenty of bodies forward as they try to find a late equaliser, but Hull now have every single player camped deep inside their own half of the pitch as they attempt to hold on to what would be three vital points."
90'+1',goal,"Goal Alfie Mawson. GOAL! Swansea have pulled one back! Narsingh is pushed to the ground over on the right wing, resulting in a free-kick for Swansea. It's curled into the penalty area by Sigurdsson and finds Mawson, who skips past Niasse and sends a bullet header into the bottom right-hand corner of the net."
90'+1',assist,Assist Gylfi Þór Sigurðsson. Assist Gylfi Þór Sigurðsson
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be four minutes of added time.
89',action,"Carroll is picked out by Fer deep down the left wing, but he's unable to swing a cross in quickly enough and has to settle for a corner. It's whipped in by Sigurdsson and fails over to the far post, but, once again, Jakupovic is there to deal with the danger."
87',action,"Niasse almost makes it 3-0! Once again, the Senegalese striker is presented with a chance to test Fabianski from inside the penalty area, but his low strike flies just wide of the near post after doing well to beat the goalkeeper's outstretched limbs."
85',action,"The ball pinballs around the left wing as Swansea try to get it under control and whip a cross into the penalty area, but Olsson is comfortably out-muscled by Elmohamady before he's able to do so and the attack fails to result in a chance on goal."
83',action,"Niasse and Grosicki link up well on the left-hand side of the Swansea penalty area before the Polish winger tries to make it 3-0, but his thumping strike towards the near post is easily saved by Fabianski."
82',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Abel Mathías Hernández Platero sub-in David Meyler . Hull have made their final substitution of the game, with Hernandez making way for sub-in David Meyler in an understandably defensive switch."
80',action,"Ayew twists and turns as he weaves his way towards the Hull penalty area, and he's then brought crashing to the ground by a poor challenge from Maguire. Sigurdsson steps up and shoots from the resulting free-kick, but he's unable to guide his shot over the wall."
78',assist,"Assist Ahmed Eissa El Mohamady Abdel Fattah. Elmohamady deserves credit for sending in the cross that caused problems for Fernandez, but that really should have been dealt with by the centre-back, who was far too clumsy in trying to clear the danger."
78',goal,"Goal El-Hadji Baye Oumar Niasse. GOAL! Niasse strikes again! A bouncing cross from Elmohamady flies into the Swansea box and should be easily dealt with by Fernandez, but the Argentine somehow lets the ball bounce between his legs and over to Niasse. With no one around him, he's easily able to fire a thumping strike past Fabianski and into the back of the net to make it 2-0 to the hosts."
77',action,"A lofted, cross-field pass is thumped over to the right flank and finds Narsingh deep down the wing, but the Dutchman is slightly too slow on the ball and is closed down well by Clucas and Grosicki, with the latter eventually dispossessing the substitute."
75',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Lazar Marković sub-in Ahmed Eissa El Mohamady Abdel Fattah . Hull have made another change, with Ahmed Elmohamady coming on to take the place of Markovic."
74',action,Olsson is able to make his way back on to the pitch but doesn't look to be moving particularly well. He could struggle at both ends of the pitch if he's unable to make a quick recovery.
73',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Lazar Marković. Ouch! Markovic charges into Olsson and catches the full-back with a crunching challenge that earns him a yellow card. The Swede looks to be in a lot of discomfort, and just after Swansea made their final substitution."
72',action,"Sigurdsson almost equalises! The Icelander is presented with another opportunity to test Jakupovic from inside the penalty area, but, once again, his shot is closed down well by the Hull defence."
71',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Wayne Routledge sub-in Luciano Narsingh . Swansea have made their third and final change as they try to find a way back into the game, with sub-in Luciano Narsingh coming on to replace Routledge."
69',assist,Assist Abel Mathías Hernández Platero. That was a wonderful pass from Hernandez to set up Niasse. He looked isolated up front during the first half but seems to be thoroughly enjoying himself alongside Niasse at the top of a positive 4-4-2 set-up.
69',goal,"Goal El-Hadji Baye Oumar Niasse. GOAL! Hull have taken the lead! A Swansea attack breaks down and allows Hull to fly forward on a swift counter. Niasse flies down the left wing and plays a quick one-two before penetrating the penalty area, and he's then able to slot a lovely shot under Fabianski and into the back of the net."
68',action,"Swansea keep pushing forward as they try to carve out another chance on goal, but they're unable to find any joy down the left flank and lose out to a sea of Hull defenders just outside of the penalty area."
66',action,"The game is starting to open up as both teams push for an opener. This time it's Sigurdsson who's presented with a good opportunity after latching on to a downward header from Routledge, but his shot is closed down and dealt with by Ranocchia."
64',action,"Hull go close! Hernandez and Niasse link up really well on the edge of the Swansea box before the latter unleashes a shot that's deflected over to the left-hand side of the penalty area. It finds Grosicki, who then skips past the onrushing Fabianski, but he's unable to tee up a team-mate and loses out on the edge of the six-yard box."
63',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Alfred John Momar N'Diaye sub-in El-Hadji Baye Oumar Niasse . Hull have made their first alteration of the afternoon, and it's an attacking one, with N'Diaye making way for Oumar Niasse."
63',action,"Sigurdsson's cross from the resulting corner is a dangerous one, and it's just about pushed behind by Jakupovic once again. The second corner then finds Mawson, but the defender's downward header is accidentally blocked by Routledge before the linesman's flag is raised."
62',action,"Great save by Jakupovic! Sigurdsson weaves his way towards the Hull penalty area before being clipped from behind by N'Diaye, resulting in a free-kick for Swansea. The Icelandic midfielder steps up and curls a wonderful strike towards the top left-hand corner of the net, but Jakupovic is there to push it round the post."
60',action,"Almost a costly mistake by Mawson! A bouncing cross flies into a dangerous position inside the Swansea penalty area and should be easily dealt with by the centre-back, but he lets it beat him. The ball then almost falls to Hernandez, but, luckily for Mawson, Fabianski is there to make sure it doesn't."
59',action,"Maguire charges into the Swansea half of the pitch before sending a lovely lofted pass over to Robertson on the left wing. The full-back takes a quick touch and rifles a low cross into the box, but Fernandez is there to deal with the danger."
58',action,"Carroll gets himself into a pocket of space over on the left wing and quickly swings a cross right on to the head of Ayew. It's sent slightly too high for the Ghanaian, however, and he's unable to stop the ball from skimming the top of his head and out for a goal-kick."
56',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Tom Huddlestone. Cork breaks through the middle of the pitch before being caught from behind by Huddlestone, who receives a yellow card for his poor sliding challenge from behind."
54',action,"Huge chance for Routledge! Sigurdsson and Carroll link up brilliantly over on the left-hand side of the Hull box before the latter fizzes a low pass across the face of goal. It's tipped out by Jakupovic but only as far as Routledge, who then blasts his first-time effort way over the top of the crossbar."
53',action,"Hull keep putting pressure on the Swansea defence as they keep breaking forward. This time it's Elabdellaoui who swings a cross into the penalty area that bounces around dangerously, but Markovic is caught offside just as he's about to shoot."
52',action,"Poor from Grosicki! The Polish winger steps up and tries to curl a cross over to the far post, but it's woefully hit and sails harmlessly out of play for a goal-kick as the home fans groan and sigh."
51',action,"Olsson is caught up the pitch, allowing Markovic to fly forward on a quick counter-attack. He cuts inside from the left wing and takes on Alfie Mawson, who cynically drags the Serbian to the ground and gives away a free-kick in a dangerous position."
49',action,"Ayew picks up the ball just outside of the Hull penalty area before spinning and finding Sigurdsson. The Icelander is in a good position and tries to charge into the box, but he's closed down from behind by N'Diaye and loses out to the midfielder."
48',action,"Huddlestone goes close! Lazar Markovic, who saw little of the ball before the break, muscles his way down the right wing and into a good position. He then curls a dangerous cross that flies just over the head of Hernandez and out to Huddlestone, who unleashes a low strike that's well saved by Fabianski."
46',action,We're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"It's been a half of few chances, with both sides lacking a cutting edge in front of goal. Swansea started the better of the two teams before Hull got themselves into the game, but neither have managed to cause the two respective goalkeepers too many problems. Grosicki has impressed over on the left flank, however, whilst, at the other end, Sigurdsson has been the architect of Swansea's most promising chances."
,action,HALF-TIME: HULL CITY 0-0 SWANSEA CITY
45'+4',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Alfred John Momar N'Diaye. Meanwhile, N'Diaye has also been booked."
45'+4',yellow-card,Yellow Card Martin Olsson. Olsson is shown a yellow card for his part in the fracas.
45'+4',action,"Alfred N'Diaye clashes with Olsson in the middle of the pitch, resulting in a free-kick for Swansea before a shoving match erupts between the two of them. Both clearly aren't happy with the other, but the referee soon brings an end to the scuffle."
45'+2',action,"More good play from Grosicki seems him skip past both Routledge and Amat before sending another cross into the Swansea penalty area. However, it's slightly overhit this time and fails to pick out a team-mate in front of goal."
45',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Fernando Llorente Torres sub-in Jordan Ayew . Llorente is still struggling after receiving a knock from Huddlestone, and he's been forced off to be replaced by sub-in Jordan Ayew."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be four minutes of added time.
44',action,"Clucas goes close! Robertson chips a wonderful cross over to the far post and right on to the head of Clucas, but the midfielder's looping header flies just over the top of the crossbar and on to the roof of the net. That was much better from the hosts!"
43',action,"Grosicki is really causing problems for Amat deep down the left flank. Once again, the Polish winger gets himself into a great position before taking on the Spaniard, but this time the defender comes out on top with a strong tackle."
42',action,"After dealing with Llorente, the Swansea medical team are called out once again to look at Fabianski. The goalkeeper took a knock whilst trying to deal with that last chance on goal, but it looks as if he's going to be able to continue."
41',action,"Brave goalkeeping by Fabianski! Once again, Grosicki causes problems for the Swansea back line over on the left-hand side of the penalty area before floating a dangerous cross over to the far post, where Hernandez is waiting. The striker looks set to reach the ball on the edge of the six-yard box, but, just as he's about to do so, Fabianski dives in the way to punch the ball away at the vital moment."
39',action,"Llorente is able to make his way back on to the pitch after receiving medical treatment for a few moments, but he's unable to chase down a lofted pass forward from Amat and can't keep the ball in play over on the left wing."
38',action,"There are more worrying moments for Swansea, as now Llorente has gone down injured after clashing with Huddlestone. He seemed to receive a knock to the thigh, leaving the striker in serious discomfort."
36',action,"Good play by Hull! Robertson is left in acres of space over on the left flank, allowing him to cut inside and tee up Grosicki. He's in a good position on the edge of the penalty area and tries to beat Fabianski with a first-time shot, but he's unable to do so and has his strike easily stopped by the goalkeeper."
35',action,Hull patiently pass the ball around inside the Swansea half of the pitch before Robertson bursts down the left wing. He initially does well to get forward but lets himself down with a final touch that pokes the ball into the feet of Amat.
33',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Àngel Rangel Zaragoza sub-in Jordi Amat Maas . Rangel goes down off the pitch and seems to be in real discomfort, resulting in him hobbling off to be replaced by Jordi Amat."
31',action,"Great tackle by Maguire! Sigurdsson cuts inside from the left wing and curls a wonderful cross right into the feet of Llorente. The striker has his back to goal and tries to quickly spin round Maguire, but he's unable to do so and loses out to the centre-back before he can shot."
29',action,"Grosicki flies down the left flank before cutting inside and taking on Federico Fernandez, but he has to settle for a corner. It's whipped in by the Polish winger and causes a few problems for Lukasz Fabianski, but, under pressure, the goalkeeper is just about able to deal with it."
27',action,"Hernandez, who has seen very little of the ball so far, is clumsily fouled just outside of the Swansea box, resulting in a free-kick for Hull in a very dangerous position. Clucas steps up and tries to curl a strike into the top right-hand corner of the net, but it's slightly underhit and fails to beat the wall."
26',action,"A lofted pass forward finds Llorente, who easily beats his marker in the air before nodding the ball down to Sigurdsson. The Icelandic midfielder is in a pocket of space and does well to send a quick pass towards Routledge, but it's slightly mishit and fails to find him on the edge of the penalty area."
25',action,"After sitting on the back foot for the last 10 minutes, Hull move the ball around nicely as they try to carve out a first chance on goal. Huddlestone gets himself into a good position before chipping a cross into the penalty area, but, despite his best efforts, Elabdellaoui is unable to get a head on the ball and loses out to Olsson."
23',action,"Another Swansea attacking move breaks down and allows Hull to hit their opponents on a quick counter-attack, but Grosicki holds on to the ball for slightly too long and is unable to send a cross into the box from deep down the right wing."
22',action,"Great interception by Robertson! Sigurdsson bursts down the left flak before sending a lovely pass into the Hull penalty area. It finds Carroll, who then cuts an equally good pass over to Routledge, but the winger is unable to get a shot away after wonderful defending from Robertson."
21',action,"After looking the brighter of the two sides early on, it's Swansea who are dominating the game at the moment. They're starting to cause plenty of problems for the Hull defenders whenever they push forward, and they're finding a lot of space in the middle of the pitch."
19',action,"Jack Cork skips past a hefty sliding tackle in the middle of the pitch as he breaks forward on a marauding run. The ball is quickly worked over to the right wing, where Routledge pokes a clever pass into the path of Rangel, but the Spaniard is just about beaten to the ball by Maguire at the vital moment."
17',action,"Chance for Llorente! The striker is dragged to the ground by Maguire, leaving the referee with no choice but to award Swansea another free-kick in a promising position. Once again, Sigurdsson's cross is impressive and finds Llorente, but he's unable to make decent enough contact with the ball to beat Jakupovic with his downward header."
15',action,"Almost an opportunity for Llorente! Routledge picks up the ball in a pocket of space on the halfway line and immediately chips a beautiful pass up to Llorente. The Spaniard peels away from Ranocchia before charging into the penalty area, but just as he's about to shoot, the linesman's flag is finally raised."
13',action,"After dealing with the danger, Hull break forward on a quick counter-attack of their own. First, Abel Hernandez loses out on the edge of the penalty area before Grosicki swings a cross into the box, but it's overhit by the Polish winger and fails to find a team-mate."
12',action,"Hull clumsily lose the ball in the middle of the pitch and allow Swansea to hit them on a swift counter-attack, but Tom Carroll's pass up towards the penalty area is a poor one and can only find the feet of Robertson."
11',action,"Grosicki catches Rangel with a swinging boot just outside of the Hull box, and Swansea are quickly awarded a free-kick in a dangerous position. Sigurdsson steps up and swings a great cross over to the far post, where Sam Clucas takes the sting off the ball and knocks it back to Jakupovic."
9',action,"Excellent save by Jakupovic! A lovely pass from Sigurdsson carves the Hull back line in two and finds Wayne Routledge in an excellent position in front of goal. He takes a quick touch before firing a low strike towards the bottom left-hand corner of the net, but Jakupovic stops it from giving Swansea the lead with an outstretched foot."
8',action,"An attempted headed clearance from Andrew Robertson flies out of play and results in a throw-in for Swansea. It's quickly sent down the right wing and into the path of Fernando Llorente on the edge of the penalty area, but he's unable to control the ball and allows it to bounce out for a goal-kick."
6',action,"Swansea push forward once again and win the first corner of the game after Olsson's attempted cross is deflected out of play by Omar Elabdellaoui. Sigurdsson steps up and curls a dangerous cross into the six-yard box, but, after a slight fumble, it's just about dealt with by Eldin Jakupovic."
5',action,"Tom Huddlestone catches Leroy Fer from behind on the halfway line, resulting in a free-kick for Swansea. It's quickly sent out to Gylfi Sigurdsson, who then tries to set up Martin Olsson after the Swede had made a good overlapping run. He's unable to do so though, as his overhit pass rolls harmlessly out of play."
3',action,"After a good start to the game from the hosts, Andrea Ranocchia tries to pick out Kamil Grosicki with a lofted pass down the left flank. It fails to find the Polish winger, however, as Angel Rangel gets a good head on the ball at the vital moment."
1',action,"We're off! Hull get us underway, attacking from right to left."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."
,action,"Meanwhile, Swansea boss Paul Clement has also made two alterations to the team that featured in their last outing, with Kyle Naughton and Luciano Narsingh making way for Angel Rangel and Wayne Routledge."
,action,"Marco Silva has decided to make two changes to the Hull side that started the defeat against Leicester last weekend, with Omar Elabdellaoui and Abel Hernandez coming into the starting line-up to replace Ahmed Elmohamady and Oumar Niasse."
,action,"Swansea City substitutes: Nordfeldt, Kingsley, Amat, Narsingh, Ayew, Baston."
,action,"Swansea City XI (4-3-3): Fabianski; Rangel, Fernandez, Mawson, Olsson; Fer, Cork, Carroll; Routledge, Llorente, Sigurdsson."

,action,"Hull were initially given a big boost by the hiring of Marco Silva at the start of the year, but after losing only one of his opening four games (with two of those ending in victories), the Tigers are now without a win in their last three outings. They did come against Arsenal and a rejuvenated Leicester City, however, so today’s clash arguably presents them with a good opportunity to get their season back on track."
,action,"As a result of their impressive recent form, Swansea now find themselves in 16th place, five points clear of the relegation zone and confident about their chances of avoiding the drop. With 18th-place Middlesbrough and bottom side Sunderland both in very poor form, Hull arguably represent the Swans’ most serious challengers near the foot of the table."
,action,"Swansea looked dead and buried under former boss Bob Bradley, but Paul Clement, the American’s successor, has done a wonderful job at revitalising a Swansea side that have thoroughly impressed in recent weeks. Last weekend’s win at home to Burnley was their fourth in six games, with only Manchester City and Chelsea managing to beat them during that time."
,action,"With just two teams separating the two struggling sides and only 11 games left to play, today’s big clash has all the hallmarks of a relegation six-pointer. A victory today could prove crucial in determining who manages to avoid dropping down to the Championship, with both teams desperate for points after suffering tough seasons so far."
