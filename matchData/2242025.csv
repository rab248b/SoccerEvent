,action,"Well, that’s all from me for now. Until next time, goodbye!"
,action,"It was all a case of too little, too late from Everton this afternoon, however. Koeman’s changes were effective, but were made too late to have a real impact, as Kane stole the show to claim the points, condemning the Toffees to their first league defeat of 2017 in the process."
,action,"It was a deserved victory for Spurs, but it is only Alli’s late strike - that seemed a mere gloss on the win initially - that has won it, with Valencia having swept home a minute later."
,action,"FULL TIME! It’s all over at White Hart Lane, where Spurs have sealed a ninth-successive league home win, despite late drama."
90'+5',yellow-card,Yellow Card Ashley Williams. A late booking for Ashley Williams for a foul on Alli.
90'+3',assist,"Assist Ross Barkley. It was a fantastic cross from Barkley, who has played well today."
90'+3',goal,"Goal Enner Remberto Valencia Lastra. GOOOOOOAAAALLLLLL!!! VALENCIA NETS! Madness at White Hart Lane, as awful defending from Spurs allowed Valencia to sweep home Barkley’s free-kick. But, it is certain to be too little, too late."
90'+2',assist,"Assist Harry Winks. It was a clever pass form Harry Winks, who exposed Everton's lacklustre defence."
90'+2',goal,"Goal Bamidele Alli. GOOOOOAAAAAALLLLL!! ALLI SEALS IT! That’s, finally, game over, as awful Everton defending allows Winks to play in Alli, who duly prods home."
90',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Harry Kane sub-in Vincent Janssen . A final Spurs substitute. sub-out Harry Kane, having won the battle of the strikers today, receives a standing ovation, as sub-in Vincent Janssen comes on."
89',action,"A nervy moment for Lloris, who very nearly allows Valencia to nip possession from him on the edge of Spurs’ area."
88',action,"Lukaku has now scored 18 PL goals in 26 games this season, equalling his tally for last season (18 goals in 37 apps in 2015/16)."
87',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Christian Dannemann Eriksen sub-in Moussa Sissoko . A Tottenham change now, as sub-in Moussa Sissoko - who turned down Everton to join Spurs in August - replaces Christian Eriksen."
86',action,"A weaving run from Barkley gets him free down the left, and his ross forces Vertonghen to concede a corner... But Lloris punches it clear and Spurs counter..."
84',action,Lukaku has now scored more goals than any other Everton player in Premier League history (61).
83',action,"A mistake from Robles again costs Everton, but this time, the keeper atones for his error by denying Kane from close-range."
82',substitution,Substitution sub-out Idrissa Gana Gueye sub-in Enner Remberto Valencia Lastra . A third and final substitution for Everton. Idrissa Gueye makes way for Enner Valencia.
81',assist,"Assist Kevin Mirallas. It was nothing more than a hopeful pass into the feet of Lukaku from Mirallas, and Vertonghen's mistake has allowed Everton right back into this!"
81',goal,"Goal Romelu Lukaku Menama. GOOOOOAAAAALLLL!!! LUKAKU HAULS EVERTON BACK INTO IT! A dreadful mistake from Vertonghen, who slips in a one-on-one with Lukaku, who makes no mistake with a venomous finish past Lloris. Game on!?"
80',action,"It’s all too easy for Spurs, as they look to well-and-truly put this game to bed. Eriksen drives in a cross-cum-shot that Robles does well to clear."
78',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Moussa Sidi Yaya Dembélé sub-in Harry Winks . A regular occurrence now, as sub-in Harry Winks comes on. This time, the youngster replaces Dembele."
77',action,"Barkley pings a pass into the feet of Mirallas from the free-kick, but it is not accurate enough, meaning the Belgian winger has to adjust his feet before unleashing a shot, which is easily blocked."
76',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Moussa Sidi Yaya Dembélé. The introduction of McCarthy has helped up the tempo though, and he combines well with Schneiderlin to tee up Coleman, who wins a free-kick right on the edge of the area, drawing a foul from Dembele."
75',action,"Everton look well-beaten here, and in all truth have looked so since the 20th minute, when Spurs blasted in Spurs’ opener. There is certainly a gulf in quality, though the visitors tactics’ were rather negative from the start..."
73',action,"CLOSE! Walker ghosted in behind Everton’s defence, nudging a simple cross back into the feet of Kane, whose shot is saved by Robles. Eriksen rifles in the rebound, but the move is called back for offside."
71',action,"Neat inter-play from Mirallas and Barkley on the edge of the area, with the latter eventually looping a strike into the arms of Lloris, who makes an easy stop."
69',action,"Spurs are simply managing this game now, setting the tempo and making Everton play at their pace. It has been a brilliant, imperious display from Pochettino’s men so far."
67',action,"Immediately, Everton look to get on the front foot, with the energy of McCarthy enabling Coleman to press higher upfield. Still, the passes into Lukaku are poor, though."
64',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Tom Davies sub-in Kevin Mirallas . The second change sees sub-out Tom Davies make way, with sub-in Kevin Mirallas his replacement."
64',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Gareth Barry sub-in James McCarthy . The first substitution sees sub-in James McCarthy replace sub-out Gareth Barry, who has struggled this afternoon."
63',action,"Finally, Everton manage to get on the ball, but the service into Lukaku is poor. Changes are being prepared, but it may already be too late..."
61',action,"Harry Kane has scored 14 home league goals this season, the highest number ever recorded by a Spurs player in a single PL season."
59',action,"Koeman’s refusal to switch his tactics may have led to Everton’s downfall, though individual errors have not helped the Dutchman’s cause. It was poor play from Robles, while Schneiderlin and Williams also failed to cover themselves in glory for that second goal."
56',assist,"Assist Bamidele Alli. It was smart play from Alli, who was on his toes to rob Schnedierlin of the ball and prod a pass into Kane’s feet, who never looked in danger of missing."
56',goal,"Goal Harry Kane. GOOOOOOOAAAALLLL!! Well, it was coming! A calamitous error from Robles, who rolls out a poor pass to Schneiderlin, and Spurs take full advantage as Kane slots home his second of the game."
55',action,"A huge cheer of appreciation from the home faithful, as Vertonghen dispossesses Barkely with a deft tackle and turn. Koeman must be looking to change things sooner rather than later..."
54',action,"What a run! A brilliant charge from Vertonghen carves Everton open, and only an instinctive Robles save denies the Belgian thumping in a second for the hosts."
53',action,"CHANCE! Spurs work a short corner into Davies, who delivers a precise cross onto the head of Alli, but the youngster can’t generate the power to beat Robles."
51',action,"A pause in play now, as Wanyama - who rattled the woodwork with a venomous strike in the first-half - receives treatment for what appears to be a knee injury. He looks set to continue though."
49',action,Everton have failed to win all 11 previous Premier League games against Spurs in which they’ve trailed at half-time (D2 L9).
47',action,"A clattering collision between Davies and Coleman, as both rush in with full-blooded challenges. Fortunately, neither is hurt."
46',action,"Welcome back! Surprisingly, there have been no changes for Everton at the break, as the Toffees get the second-half underway."
,action,"Everton have rarely threatened, and Koeman must surely look to switch systems now, with Barry looking particularly sluggish in midfield, and Lukaku isolated. Spurs could have added more, but Kane, Eriksen and Wanyama all failed to apply the finishes."
,action,"We’ve reached the interval here, and despite a workmanlike display in which they restricted Spurs for 20 minutes, Everton are fortunate to only be 1-0 down. The game was lit up by a moment of magic from Kane, who moves to the top of the Premier League scoring charts in the process."
,action,HALF-TIME: Tottenham 1-0 Everton.
45',action,"Tom Davies makes a brilliant run from deep to take in Coleman’s cross-field pass, but he is wrongly flagged offside."
42',action,"Spurs are unbeaten in eight Premier League games against Everton (W3 D5) since a 2-1 defeat at Goodison Park in December 2012. The Toffees have grown back into this game in recent moments, though it is the hosts who are in pole position..."
40',action,"CHANCE! Davies gets into Everton’s box courtesy of a fortunate bounce, swiftly proceeding to lob in a cross. Eriksen meets it, directing his header back across goal, but the ball inches wide."
37',action,"Good work from Barkley, who pressurises Walker and Dier, winning a corner for his efforts… The playmaker delivers a decent cross, but both Mori and Lukaku fail to apply the finishing touch."
35',action,"CLOSE! Barry finds space in the final third and dinks an inviting lob into the path of Lukaku, who had drifted clear of his marker. The Belgian stretches out a leg, but can’t make contact."
34',action,"It is all a bit too congested for Everton now, and while that aided them in the openings stages, it is proving difficult for their more influential attacking players to gain a foothold on proceedings."
32',action,"Fantastic goalkeeping from Lloris prevents what may have been - against the run of play - an Everton leveller. Barkley seemed down the right, powering in a superb cross that seemed destined for Lukaku, but the France goalkeeper was on hand to tip it away."
30',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Idrissa Gana Gueye. The rain is teeming down at White Hart Lane now, and at the moment Everton are caught in the eye of a Tottenham storm. Gueye picks up the first booking of the game for a late lunge on Davies..."
29',action,"POST! Everton have completely lost their composure now, and Wanyama very nearly added a second with a thunderous strike that rattled the woodwork. Kane latched onto the rebound, firing wide, though he was offside anyway."
27',action,"A reckless challenge from Funes Mori puts Everton on the back foot, with Spurs now having the opportunity to test Everton’s defence from another set-piece… Eriksen whips in an immaculate delivery, but Kane just fails to connect."
26',action,"CLOSE! A sloppy pass from Lukaku allows Kane to thread Eriksen through, but the former Ajax man can only slide his effort wide. Everton are living dangerously at the moment..."
24',action,"Kane has now scored 11 times in 10 competitive appearances in 2017 for Spurs. He almost had another one there, having read Walker’s cross, but Robles managed to get there first."
22',action,"CHANCE! Suddenly, Everton’s defence looks all at sea. Kane finds himself in space in the area, taking the ball around Williams before unleashing a powerful strike, but Robles is out quickly to make the save. Eriksen collects the loose ball, only to blast his effort over."
20',assist,"Assist Ben Davies. Davies will be credited with the assist, but that goal was all Kane, though questions can be asked of Everton’s defending."
20',goal,"Goal Harry Kane. GOOOOOAAAAALLLL!! Talk about the curse of the commentator! It’s that man Kane, who produces a moment of quality from absolutely nothing! The England striker took the ball out on the left, drifting in from the flank, breezing off four defenders before thumping a dipping strike into the bottom-left corner."
19',action,"Koeman will be pleased with his side’s effort in the opening 20 minutes, with Spurs restricted to rather little despite dominating possession, but he will be now looking for Everton to step-up their attacking impetus."
17',action,"Everton are really starting to pressures Spurs in midfield, but at the moment have not been able to find the final ball into Lukaku. Spurs manage to get up the other end, though, with Alli winning a soft free-kick after colliding with Schneiderlin... Again, however, Eriksen's delivery is cleared."
15',action,"A mix-up between Spurs’ defence allows Davies to nip in on the edge of the area, having made a fantastic run from deep. However, at the vital moment, Dier recovers to make an excellent tackle."
13',action,"Pochettino is hunting his 100th win in English football, if you include his time at Southampton. But Spurs are being held at arms length by Everton at the moment."
10',action,"With Everton having set-up to congest the midfield, it is making life very difficult for both sides to get the ball down on the deck. However, it is Spurs who have had the majority of the ball so far..."
8',action,"A big call from the referee Michael Oliver, and he gets it spot on! Waker isolated Baines down the right, but the Everton full-back managed to nip in with a fantastic tackle. Spurs wanted a penalty, but there was nothing doing for the official."
7',action,"Superb defending from Vertonghen! Everton countered, with Barkley picking out Lukaku with a sublime pass. The Belgium striker drove into the area, but his compatriot did brilliantly to time his challenge."
6',action,"Eriksen’s free-kick is a poor one, though, and the wall blocks it. The Danish playmaker regains possession, but a combination of Baines and Schnedierlin copes with the resulting cross."
5',action,"A chance now for Spurs from a free-kick, as Alli draws a clumsy foul from Barry around 25 yards out from goal..."
4',action,"STAT - Spurs are the only unbeaten side at home in the Premier League this season, winning 11 of 13 fixtures (W11 D2 L0), having conceded just five goals at White Hart Lane."
3',action,"Neat play from Coleman and Gueye down the right results in the latter whipping in a dangerous cross. Davies attempts to connect, but the youngster just times his header wrong."
1',action,"KICK-OFF! Spurs, donning their usual black and white away strip, get proceedings underway..."
,action,"We’re just moments away from kick-off at White Hart Lane. Spurs are chasing a ninth straight home victory in the league - which would represent a new club record. Koeman, however, is the last visiting manager to claim a top-flight win here."
,action,"Everton have already gained 44 points this season, and one more victory would see them match last term’s total with more than 10 games remaining. Spurs, however, are looking to apply some pressure to run-away league leaders Chelsea, with Manchester City and Liverpool both hunting down second place."
,action,"There’s plenty of quality on show for both sides, but it is undoubtedly the two No.10s who are the stars. Harry Kane and Lukaku are tied on 17 goals a-piece at the top of the Premier League scoring charts."
,action,"An interesting selection from Koeman, who seems to have gone for a compact shape rather than attempt to match Spurs’ three-at-the-back system. Ademola Lookman is the only player to drop out, with veteran Gareth Barry coming in. Tom Davies and Ross Barkley will be tasked with supporting Romelu Lukaku, who is one goal away from becoming Everton’s top-scorer in the Premier League."
,action,"TEAM NEWS - Everton substitutes: Jagielka, Mirallas, McCarthy, Valencia, Stekelenburg, Holgate, Lookman."
,action,"TEAM NEWS - Everton (4-3-2-1): Robles; Coleman, Williams, Funes Mori, Baines; Gueye, Schneiderlin, Barry; Davies, Barkley; Lukaku."
,action,The big news for Spurs is that Belgian duo Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen - who both went off injured against Stoke - are fit to start today. It means that Mauricio Pochettino retains the same starting XI that featured last week.
,action,"TEAM NEWS - Tottenham substitutes: Son, Janssen, Vorm, Trippier, Sissoko, Wimmer, Winks."
,action,"TEAM NEWS - Tottenham (3-4-2-1): Lloris; Dier, Alderweireld, Vertonghen; Walker, Wanyama, Dembele, Davies; Eriksen, Alli; Kane."
,action,The team news is in now from north London. Let’s start off with the hosts…
,action,"But they are likely to face tougher opposition in the form of Everton this afternoon, who they drew with at Goodison Park on the opening day of the season. Ronald Koeman’s side are unbeaten in the league in 2017, though while their home form has been scintillating, they have failed to win their last three away fixtures."
,action,"Spurs came undone the last time they faced Merseyside opposition - losing 2-0 against Liverpool at Anfield two games ago. After dropping out of the Europa League, they returned to winning ways in style last time out, thumping Stoke City 4-0."
,action,"Hello and welcome, football fans, to LIVE coverage of what promises to be an enthralling encounter between two of the Premier League’s in-form sides, as Tottenham host Everton at White Hart Lane!"
