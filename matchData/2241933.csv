,action,"Everton earn a vital win this afternoon to get them back on track after losing the Merseyside derby last week. Goals from Kevin Mirallas and Romelu Lukaku have fired them to the three points to lift them back up the table, with the hope of an improvement in the second half of the term."

83',action,"CHANCE!  Gueye misses a huge chance to secure the points as Barkley releases Lukaku in the final third and he in turn sends the ball across the face of goal. However, with the entire net to hit the midfielder can only send his strike over the bar on the slide."
81',action,"Simpson sends a cross deep to the back post and Ulloa rises to head it back across goal, but there are no blue shirts ready to pounce on the loose ball."
79',yellow-card,Yellow Card Danny Simpson. Simpson goes into the book for a foul on Barkley.
78',action,"Davies collects 30 yards from goal and makes a decent run towards goal. No Leicester player goes to close him down so he shoots from the edge of the box, just sending his effort narrowly past the post."

76',action,"Everton are doing a lot of defending at the moment, but are holding firm for now as the Foxes look a little short of ideas."

68',substitution,Substitution sub-out Gareth Barry sub-in Tom Davies . Davies replaces Barry for the visitors.

51',assist,Assist Joel Robles Blázquez. Robles notches an assist with a simple clearance downfield to tee up Mirallas.
51',goal,Goal Kevin Mirallas. GOALLL!!! MIRALLAS PUTS EVERTON AHEAD! The Toffees take the lead out of nothing as Robles' kick from deep plays Mirallas behind the Leicester defence. The Belgian keeps his composure to fire at goal and the ball finds the net with the aid of a deflection off Wasilewski. Too easy for the visitors.

48',action,"CHANCE! Albrighton nods a long ball from Chilwell into the path of Slimani, but the striker can only scuff his effort on the half-volley well wide of the post. The Algerian does not look confident out there."
47',action,"Albrighton sends a cross into the box from the right and Gray tries to latch on to it at the back post, but Robles scampers off his line to gather."

40',action,"Lukaku has done very little in the first half, but that's not his fault as he has been starved of service. The past two times he has received the ball his touch has been extremely poor on the edge of the box."

33',action,"We're back underway as Slimani leaves the field, which puts the Foxes down to 10 men."
32',action,Slimani goes down to change his boot and for some reason the referee allows him to do this on the pitch. There will be delay until this is resolved.

22',action,Williams has to be alert at the back once again to stop Albrighton's cross from finding its target in the box.

16',action,"Chilwell makes a great forward run from the back and cuts the ball back across the face of goal, but Barry is on hand to clear it behind."
14',action,"CHANCE! Barry's poor delivery from a corner is claimed by Schmeichel and it allows the Foxes to break. Gray surges through the middle and fires at goal from 25 yards, but his effort just trickles wide of the post."
13',action,"Everton move the ball with speed down the flank and Lennon has the chance to find him with a cross from the byline, but he fails to beat the first man with his attempt."
11',action,"SAVE! Amartey and Okazaki combine on the edge of the box, and it gives the midfielder an opportunity to strike on the half-volley. However, Robles gets down well to make a comfortable save."
10',action,"King sends a good low ball into the box for Albrighton's cross-field rub, but the winger's effort at goal is blocked by Funes Mori."
9',action,Referee Atwell draws the ire of the home fans for not playing advantage for a foul on King. Slimani did have possession on the half-way line before the official brought play back.
8',action,"Everton probe away on the edge of the box, but again Leicester hold firm in their defensive shape and force the mistake from the visitors."

,action,"The players are making their way out on to the pitch, so we should be underway shortly."

,action,"The Toffees' bright start to the season seems a distant memory now. Although their recent win over Arsenal alleviated some pressure on Koeman, the Dutchman will need his side to perform over the next few weeks to stop further questioning of his position."
,action,"Everton come into this game off the back of their crushing defeat at the hands of rivals Liverpool in the Merseyside derby last week. Koeman's side appeared to have done enough to secure a point, but Sadio Mane's 94th-minute winner allowed the Reds to snatch the win."
,action,"They put in their best performance of the season in their last match at the King Power Stadium, defeating Manchester City 4-2 in a scoreline that flattered Pep Guardiola's men. Ranieri will be hopeful of a similar display against the Toffees."
,action,"Despite that solid comeback, Claudio Ranieri's men need to start picking up points at home. The reigning champions were a dominant force at home last season, and will need to reproduce that form to push away from the relegation zone."
,action,"Leicester claimed a vital point in their last outing as they battled back from two goals down with 10 men to draw away at Stoke City. However, the Foxes host Ronald Koeman's men today undermanned without the suspended Jamie Vardy along with Robert Huth."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to the live commentary of the Premier League clash between Leicester City and Everton at the King Power Stadium.
