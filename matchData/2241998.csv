90'+4',action,Rondon kills time in the corner by holding off Bardsley. The full-back wipes him out in an attempt to win the ball. This will allow the Baggies to take further time off the clock.
90'+2',action,"SCRAMBLE! Ngoy gets the ball in the inside right channel and his effort takes a huge deflection to bounce into the six-yard box. However, Dawson is there to clear the danger with a header away."
90'+1',action,"CHANCE! Livermore spurns a chance to win the game as the hosts break on the counter. Rondon picks out his team-mate in the box, but he loses control at the vital moment and Grant gathers."

87',substitution,Substitution sub-out Matt Phillips sub-in Hal Robson-Kanu . Finally Robson-Kanu replaces Phillips after the Baggies initially wanted to bring Rondon off. Shawcross and Arnautovic were not happy men.
86',action,Stoke are furious with the fourth official and the West Brom bench as the Baggies take their time with a substitution.
84',action,West Brom are in dire need of an out ball here. The pressure is beginning to build on their backline and this game has had a propensity for late goals in past meetings.
82',action,"Livermore does well at the back for the hosts as he dispossesses Arnautovic, but as he clears upfield the ball lands straight at the feet of Whelan."
81',action,"WHAT A MISS! Pieters should bring the Potters level as he rises to head Bardsley's cross at the back post towards goal. However, he gets his header all wrong from six yards, putting it well wide of the post."
80',action,"West Brom fans roar in delight as Berahino is dispossessed on the edge of the box by Fletcher, but there is no player upfield for the home side and the Potters come again."
78',action,Grant has been impressive between the sticks today for the Potters and continues his good outing with a firm punch to clear Brunt's corner away from the penalty area.
76',action,"Diouf chases a long ball over the top into the channel. He works the ball back to Arnautovic, but the cross from the Austrian is poor and the attack peters out for the visitors."
74',action,"TACKLE! Whelan does brilliantly at the back for the Potters as he saves a certain goal. Rondon's deflected effort fell into the path of Fletcher, but the Stoke midfielder didn't give up and made the challenge to stop his goalbound strike."
72',action,"The resulting corner is disappointing as the first ball is cleared, while on the follow-up Brunt curls the ball straight into Grant's hands."
71',action,"SAVE! McClean picks up the ball on the left and cuts inside on his right foot to power an effort at goal. The ball looks to be heading towards the top corner, but Grant makes a brilliant one-handed save to turn it over the bar."
69',substitution,Substitution sub-out Ibrahim Afellay sub-in Julien Ngoy . Afellay is replaced by Ngoy for the visitors.
69',action,"West Brom are just lacking a creative edge at the moment in the final third. They're holding firm defensively at the moment, but Pulis will be desperate for a second goal."
67',action,"The game is lacking tempo at the moment, especially from the home side who are beginning to sit quite deep in front of their own goal."
66',substitution,Substitution sub-out Nacer Chadli sub-in James McClean . Pulis reshuffles his pack as McClean replaces Chadli.
66',yellow-card,Yellow Card Ben Foster. Foster heads into the book for timewasting.
65',action,"Afellay gets in behind Brunt on the flank to latch on to Allen's throughball, but the offside flag goes up as he crosses into the box."
63',action,"Phillips collects in space down the right and drives towards the byline. He fires a cross in with pace, but it lacks any direction and sails out for a goal-kick."
61',action,"OVER! The Stoke defence back off Morrison on a surge forward, inviting the midfielder to fire at goal. He accepts the opportunity, but hammers his effort over the bar."
60',yellow-card,Yellow Card Matt Phillips. Phillips goes into the book for a foul on Pieters.
60',action,"SHOT! Bardsley lines up his second effort of the day as he fires at goal from distance, but his shot nestles into the arms of Foster."

58',action,"Chadli breaks into the final third to tee up Rondon, who in turn finds Phillips on the flank. The winger sends a first-time cross into the box, but Martins Indi clears the danger."
57',action,"Allen almost pounces on a ball from Adam in the box, but McAuley and Dawson do enough to force a corner for the visitors."

52',action,SHOT! Space opens up in the final third for Bardsley to strike at goal from distance. His effort has the power and it sails inches past the post with Foster scrambling.
50',action,"WIDE! Martins Indi wins the initial header to clear for the Potters, but it travels to Chadli at the back post. However, the ball moves too quickly for him to react and it simply bounces off his head and goes wide."
49',action,Pieters flies into a challenge with Phillips and gives away a free-kick in a dangerous position on the right flank.
48',action,"Adam goes for goal from 25 yards and he strikes the ball with power, but does not have the dip to sail under the bar."

46',action,We're back underway at The Hawthorns.
,action,"The players are back out for the second half, so we should be underway shortly."
,action,Stoke will feel that they should be level as Ryan Shawcross and Joe Allen missed good chances towards the end of the half. Mark Hughes will want to see more from his side in the attacking third after the break.
,action,"The Baggies lead at the break thanks to James Morrison's second strike of the week. The midfielder collected Nacer Chadli's throughball and fired past Lee Grant in the sixth minute and Tony Pulis' men have played some good attacking football, but have not managed to secure a second goal."

45',action,There will be one minute of added time.

43',action,"WIDE! Stoke clear the first ball into the box, but Livermore gathers on the edge of the box. The midfielder scuffs his volley, sending it well wide of the post."
42',action,"OVER! West Brom come close to a second as Chadli and Brunt exchange passes on the left flank before the former finds Phillips on the edge of the box. The winger tries to steer the ball into the top corner, but Martins Indi diverts it enough to take it over the bar."
40',action,Crouch has barely been in the game thus far and his frustrating afternoon continues as he is penalised for a foul on McAuley.
37',action,"Rondon wipes out Grant as he tries to close down the Stoke keeper following a short backpass. There was no contact, although Grant did have to jump quickly to avoid the striker."

34',action,"SAVE! West Brom break and Morrison threads the ball through to Chadli. Shawcross makes the tackle, but diverts it straight to Rondon. The striker shoots with power towards the bottom corner, but Grant gets down to make the save."
33',action,"Stoke raid again down the right and Bardsley stands the ball up to Crouch in the box. The striker wins the header and knocks it back towards Allen, but it just evades the Welshman."
32',action,Bardsley knocks the ball over Brunt's head and hits the deck as he runs past the left-back. No free-kick is the decision from referee Friend.

25',action,Boos echo around The Hawthorns as Berahino goes through his warm-up routine on the sideline.
24',action,"WIDE! Chadli collects 25 yards from goal and attempts to curl an effort towards the bottom corner. However, his strike drifts wide of the post."

18',action,Brunt does well in his defensive duties at the back as he calmly chests the ball back to Foster from Pieters' cross into the box. Not a great deal of service for Crouch thus far.
16',action,"Phillips runs down the flank with menace and attempts to beat Pieters, but the defender sticks to his task to concede only a throw-in."
14',action,"Livermore bursts forward and slides the ball into Rondon on the move. The forward breaks into the box, but Martins Indi times his challenge to perfection to stop his progress."
13',action,"A decent start to the game from both teams. West Brom are ahead and naturally will be the happier of the two sides, but the Potters are carrying a threat themselves."
11',action,"CHANCE! Chadli causes havoc on the left and there a mild claims for a penalty as the ball strikes Shawcross. Brunt takes over from the deflection and whips the ball across the face of goal, but Morrison and Rondon both fail to connect inside the six-yard box."

6',assist,Assist Nacer Chadli. Chadli slides a delightful throughball for Morrison and the midfielder does the rest with a neat finish.
