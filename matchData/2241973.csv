,action,"The referee blows his whistle for the final and the Swansea fans and players all go wild! They have managed to leave Anfield with a truly historic victory, one that has temporarily dragged them out of the relegation zone and up to 17th place. Once again, poor defending from Liverpool cost them dearly, resulting in Firmino's two goals counting for little at the final whistle."
,action,FULL-TIME: LIVERPOOL 2-3 SWANSEA CITY
90'+5',action,"Liverpool thump ball after ball forward as they desperately try to find a way back into the game, but they look bereft of ideas are unable to cause Swansea too many problems. The visitors have largely performed very well in the air, resulting in the home side finding little joy in front of goal when they fire hopeful balls into the penalty area."
90'+4',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Georginio Wijnaldum sub-in Joël Job Matip . Meanwhile, Liverpool have brought on Joel Matip to replace Wijnaldum and act as an auxiliary striker."
90'+4',substitution,Substitution sub-out Leroy Fer sub-in Jay Fulton . Fer gingerly makes his way off the pitch to be replaced by sub-in Jay Fulton.
90'+3',action,"Fer goes down off the ball in front of the Kop, resulting in the Liverpool fans berating him for what they see as time-wasting. The Swansea medical team are eventually called on, and it doesn't look as if the Dutchman is going to be able to continue."
90'+2',action,"Wijnaldum gets himself into a good position over on the left-hand side of the Swansea penalty area as Liverpool desperately try to find a late equaliser, but his cross fails to pick out a red shirt in front of goal and, again, Fabianski is there to cut out the danger."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be five minutes of added time.
90',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Leroy Fer. Fer and Clyne clash in the middle of the pitch, resulting in the Dutchman throwing himself to the floor. The referee isn't at all happy with his behaviour, however, and awards him a yellow card for simulation. Liverpool are unable to make the resulting free-kick count, however, and Fabianski easily cuts out the danger."
88',action,"Fer ploughs towards the Liverpool box before being dragged back by Henderson, resulting in a free-kick for Swansea in a very dangerous position 25 yards away from goal. Sigurdsson steps up and shoots, but his bouncing shot can only find the side-netting after beating the wall in front of him."
86',action,"Two great chances for Lallana! The midfielder breaks into the left-hand side of the penalty area before testing Fabianski, but his deflected shot ends up bouncing off the top of the crossbar. It falls down to Sturridge, who then tees up Lallana once again, but his headed effort is unable to hit the target."
85',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Fernando Llorente Torres sub-in Borja González Tomás . Swansea have made another alteration, with Llorente making way for Borja Baston."
83',action,"Liverpool look bereft of ideas when pushing forward, which is making life easy for Swansea. The visitors are now comfortably holding on to possession inside the home side's half of the pitch as they desperately try to keep hold of the ball for as long as possible."
81',action,"Thundering strike by Lovren! The Swansea midfield step off the Croatian centre-back and allow him to unleash a rocket of a shot from 30 yards out, but Fabianski gets a strong hand on the effort to tip it over the top of the crossbar."
79',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Martin Olsson sub-in Àngel Rangel Zaragoza . Swansea have made a late, defensive change, with Angel Rangel coming on to replace Olsson."
78',action,"Origi goes close! A Liverpool corner isn't dealt with well enough by the Swansea defence and allows Origi to spin and shoot, but the Belgian is unable to find the back of the net as, once again, Fabianski pulls off a great save at the near post."
76',action,"Another important piece of goalkeeping from Fabianski! Once again, Lallana gets himself into a great position over on the right-hand side of the box before whipping a low cross towards goal, but the goalkeeper just about gets a hand on the ball to sendit away from Origi and Firmino."
74',goal,"Goal Gylfi Þór Sigurðsson. GOAL! Swansea are back in front! Swansea push forward on a rare attack, with Carroll doing well to muscle his way towards the penalty area. He's unable to find a way through a sea of red shirts before an attempted Klavan clearance rolls over to Sigurdsson, who then calmly slots a lovely shot past the outstretched limbs of Mignolet. What a game!"
73',action,"Liverpool go close again! Lallana twists and turns on the left-hand side of the Swansea penalty area before chipping a lovely cross into the middle of the box. It finds Origi, who then tries to nod the ball down to a team-mate, but Fabianski does well ot cut out the danger at the crucial moment."
72',action,"Almost an early chance for Origi! Lovren pushes into the Swansea half of the pitch and immediately whips a bouncing cross over to the far post, but the Belgian striker is slightly flat-footed in trying to get to the ball and is unable to get a shot away from close range."
70',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Emre Can sub-in Divock Okoth Origi . Liverpool have made another change, with Can making way for Divock Origi."
69',assist,"Assist Georginio Wijnaldum. Wijnaldum's first touch in the build-up was wonderful, but Fernandez should have done better to deal with him. The defender completely mistimed his attempted tackle, leaving Wijnaldum all alone in a pocket of space whilst the Argentine was out of position."
69',goal,"Goal Roberto Firmino Barbosa de Oliveira. GOAL! Liverpool have equalised! Wijnaldum darts down the left wing on a great run before skipping past Fernandez far too easily. The Dutchman chests the ball down beautifully before sending a looping cross into the middle of the box, where Firmino brings it down before rifling an excellent shot into the bottom left-hand corner of the net."
68',action,"Lallana twists and turns inside the Swansea penalty area before winning the home side a corner over on the left wing. It's swung into the box and flies towards the near post, but Fernandez is there to deal with the danger with a great headed clearance."
66',action,"Mawson almost makes it 3-1! Once again, Swansea cause problems for Liverpool with a dangerous cross into the middle of the penalty area, but Mawson's looping header ends up flying just wide of the far post after leaving Fabianski rooted to the spot."
65',action,"A Liverpool attacking move comes to an end, allowing Swansea to counter quickly. They initially do well through Routledge, who storms down the right flank on a marauding run, but Klavan darts across the pitch to deal with the winger."
63',action,"Milner finds Clyne once again before a dangerous low cross is fired into the heart of the penalty area, but it's unable to find Firmino in front of goal and Fernandez does well to blast the ball away with a well-timed interception on the penalty spot."
62',action,"Henderson and Milner link up well over on the right wing before the latter spins and finds Sturridge. The striker then cuts inside and tries to set up Lallana with a lofted pass over to the opposite flank, but it's poorly hit and sails straight out of play for a throw-in."
60',action,"Big call by the referee! Llorente charges into the Liverpool half of the pitch before being blocked by Klavan, leaving the Spaniard in a heap on the floor as he holds his cheek. The Swansea players all scream for a second yellow card for the Estonian defender, but the referee doesn't agree and allows play to go on before calling on the visitors' medical staff."
58',action,"Clyne cuts inside from the right wing and heads across the edge of the Swansea penalty area before teeing up Henderson. The captain is in a pocket of space and quickly unleashes a low shot, but it doesn't have enough power behind it to trouble Fabianski at the near post."
57',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Philippe Coutinho Correia sub-in Daniel Sturridge . Liverpool have made their first substitution of the game, with Coutinho making way for Sturridge."
55',assist,"Assist James Milner. Milner, who has been left in plenty of space on several occasions this afternoon, has impressed with his crossing today, but this one was the first that resulted in a chance on goal for a Liverpool player. Olsson is claiming that he was pushed by Firmino in the build-up, but the referee isn't at all interested."
55',goal,Goal Roberto Firmino Barbosa de Oliveira. GOAL! Liverpool have pulled one back! Milner is left in a pocket of space over on the left wing and quickly whips a wonderful cross into the middle of the penalty area. Firmino does well to beat Olsson in the air and then sends a bullet header past Fabianski and into the bottom left-hand corner of the net. Game on!
54',action,"It looks as if both Daniel Sturridge and Divock Origi are warming up as Klopp watches yet another attempted Liverpool attack come to an end. With three goals now needed to leave with a victory, the German needs to do something quickly if his side are to have any chance of getting back into the game."
52',goal,"Goal Fernando Llorente Torres. GOAL! It's 2-0 to Swansea! The Liverpool defence are all over the place once again as the visitors break forward. Carroll gets himself into a wonderful position before swinging a brilliant cross into the penalty area, and Llorente then doubles his side's lead with a great downward header."
52',assist,Assist Tom Carroll. Assist Tom Carroll
50',action,"Liverpool immediately try to push forward from the restart, but they're unable to do so and again run into traffic inside the Swansea half of the pitch. The visitors have defended brilliantly and now, with a goal under their belts, are looking comfortable and confident."
48',assist,"Assist Wayne Routledge. It was Routledge who got the final touch on the ball to tee up Llorente, but questions have to be asked of the Liverpool defence, who were all over the place and didn't do at all well enough in dealing with the danger from the corner."
48',goal,"Goal Fernando Llorente Torres. GOAL! Swansea have taken the lead! A chipped cross from Naughton flies into the Liverpool penalty area and towards Fer, but Lovren is there to head the ball out for a corner with an unconvincing clearance. The resulting set-piece is fired into the middle of the box and finds Fernandez, who nods the ball downwards and sets up Llorente to toe-poke a thumping shot into the back of the net from close range."
46',action,And we're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"Groans of frustration ring around Anfield as the two teams make their way off the pitch, and they certainly aren't coming from the Swansea fans. The away side have defended admirably thus far, resulting in them continually frustrating a Liverpool side that have struggled to test Lukasz Fabianski. At the other end, they went closest to opening the scoring, with a rare chance on goal seeing Carroll hit the post. They'll have to be a little more adventurous if they want to leave with all three points, but, so far, everything is going to plan for Paul Clement's new side."
,action,HALF-TIME: LIVERPOOL 0-0 SWANSEA CITY
45'+1',action,"Liverpool try to push forward on one final attacking move before the half-time break, but they're unable to do so and, once again, well-organised and determined defending from Swansea results in the visitors easily managing to keep their opponents at bay."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be just one minute of added time.
44',action,"And now Coutinho makes a clumsy mistake after getting himself into a good position deep inside the Swansea half of the pitch, as a poor final touch sends the ball rolling out of play before he's able to swing a cross into the penalty area."
43',action,"It just isn't going right for Liverpool at the moment. Coutinho, who has been involved in almost all of the home side's best attacking moves, cuts in from the left flank before trying to tee up Clyne with a great cross-field pass, but the full-back's attempted first touch is poor and lets the ball bounce under his boot and out for a goal-kick."
41',action,"Another opportunity for Firmino! The Swansea midfield fail to press Lallana well enough and allow him to whip a cross over to Firmino, but there's slightly too much height on the pass and, despite his best efforts, the forward is unable to hit the target with his header."
39',action,"Firmino twists and turns as he tries to tee up Wijnaldum with two crosses, but both fail to find the Dutchman in front of goal. The Brazilian's second cross is deflected away by Mawson and out to Lovren, and the defender sends an audacious and poorly hit effort well wide of the goal."
37',action,"Half chance for Mawson! A lovely free-kick from Sigurdsson flies into the Liverpool penalty area and finds Mawson in plenty of space over on the left-hand side of the box, but the defender's first-time half-volley ends up flying safely over the top of the crossbar."
36',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Ragnar Klavan. A poor pass from Lallana fails to find a red shirt on the edge of the Swansea penalty area, allowing Olsson to fly forward on a marauding run. The full-back charges through the middle of the pitch and does well to penetrate the Liverpool half of the pitch, but as soon as he does so, he's clattered to the ground by a cynical challenge from Klavan."
34',action,"Tremendous block by Mawson! A Lallana pass fails to find Coutinho, but Naughton is too sow in trying to clear the danger and has his pocket picked by the Brazilian. He then quickly tees up Firmino, who is in a pocket of space and immediately unleashes a shot, but Mawson is there to throw his body in the way of the strike to send it spinning out of play for a corner."
32',action,"Can falls asleep on the ball and is dispossessed from behind by Llorente. Swansea quickly try to embark on a counter-attack through Routledge, who then spins and finds Leroy Fer, but the Dutchman can't pick out Sigurdsson deep down the left flank."
30',action,"Swansea patiently work the ball around as they enjoy a good spell of possession, but, after linking up well with Naughton, Routledge is unable to find a way past Can and loses out to the German midway inside the Liverpool half of the pitch."
28',action,"Liverpool have continually dominated possession thus far, but they're struggling to break down a resolute Swansea side. The visitors are looking far more well-organised than they have in recent weeks, and it's making life very tough for the home side."
26',action,"Wonderful opportunity for Firmino! Milner is left in acres of space over on the left wing and is easily able to swing a fantastic cross into the heart of the Swansea box, but it ends up fizzing an inch or so over the head of Firmino, who was in a great position in front of goal."
24',action,"Once again, a chipped pass forward causes problems for Swansea on the break, but Coutinho's run through the middle of the visitors' back line is slightly mistimed and he's flagged offside as soon as he latches on to Lallana's pass."
22',action,"Vital block by Fernandez! Coutinho drops deep to pick up the ball before chipping a wonderful pass over to James Milner. The full-back darts down the left wing and does well to keep the ball in play before firing a low cross towards Firmino, but Fernandez is just about able to cut out the danger with a crucial interception."
20',action,"Carroll hits the post! Completely against the run of play, Carroll darts into the left-hand side of the Liverpool box on a great run before firing a low shot towards the near post. It takes a slight deflection off the leg of Dejan Lovren that catches out Mignolet, who is beaten by the effort but sees it ricocheting off the woodwork."
18',action,"Liverpool come back once again, this time through Firmino. The Brazilian twists and turns as he darts down the left channel and then chips a lovely cross over to the far post, but it's just in front of Can, who is unable to meet the ball in an excellent position in front of goal."
17',action,"Acrobatic effort by Lallana! Clyne easily skips past Alfie Mawson as he beats the defender on the right-hand side of the Swansea box. The full-back then chips a great cross over to Lallana, who pulls off an audacious overhead kick that flies just over the top of the crossbar."
16',action,"Olsson is dispossessed just inside the Liverpool half of the pitch, allowing the home side to break forward on a quick counter-attack. Lallana flies towards the Swansea penalty area before playing a swift one-two with Coutinho, but his attempted first-time cross into the box is poor and sails harmlessly out for a goal-kick."
14',action,"Liverpool are initially unable to make the set-piece count, but they quickly come back at Swansea once again. A lovely cross-field pass from Lallana picks out Philippe Coutinho on the left wing, and the Brazilian then sets up Henderson on the edge of the penalty area. The captain is urged to shoot, but his first touch is poor and allows Fernando Llorente to poke the ball away from danger."
13',action,"Clyne and Roberto Firmino link up well over on the right-hand side of the Swansea penalty area before the latter cuts inside and chips a cross towards the near post, but Federico Fernandez is just about able to get a head on the ball to send it away from Lallana and out for a corner."
11',action,"Routledge finds some space after darting down the right wing, but he's unable to guide a cross past Ragnar Klavan and has to settle for a throw-in. It's taken quickly and sent short to Kyle Naughton, but the full-back is also unable to fire his cross into the Liverpool box and the home side are easily able to deal with the danger."
9',action,"Fantastic chance for Can! Once again, Clyne causes problems deep down the right flank before spinning and teeing up Henderson. The captain immediately whips a lovely cross into the heart of the penalty area that picks out Can, but the German ends up sending his bullet header flying over the top of the crossbar."
7',action,"Liverpool revert to patiently passing the ball around inside the Swansea half of the pitch as they try to find a way through the sea of white shirts camped in front of them. Clyne is eventually able to carve out a pocket of space for himself over on the right wing, but his chipped cross into the box fails to pick out a team-mate."
5',action,"Tom Carroll flies down the left flank and makes a good run forward as he tries to latch on to a poked pass forward from fellow new signing Martin Olsson, but, despite his best efforts, the youngster is unable to get the ball from rolling out of play as he tries to take on Nathaniel Clyne."
3',action,"Liverpool move the ball around nicely as they push forward on their first attack of the game. Emre Can does well to get himself into a good position deep down the left flank before spinning and finding Jordan Henderson, but the captain's looping cross ends up flying just past Georginio Wijnaldum's outstretched leg at the far post."
2',action,"A poor pass from Adam Lallana flies straight to Wayne Routledge, who then tries to kick-start a quick counter-attack. Swansea are unable to take advantage of the mistake, however, as Gylfi Sigurdsson's first touch is poor and sends the ball bouncing into the feet of Simon Mignolet."
1',action,"And we're off! Liverpool get us underway, attacking from right to left."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out on to the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."
,action,"Swansea boss Paul Clement has made three alterations to the team that featured in their last outing, with the most notable inclusions being new signings Martin Olsson and Tom Carroll, both of whom start after joining from Tottenham Hotspur and Norwich City, respectively. Meanwhile, Sung-Yeung Ki makes way for Leroy Fer in the centre of midfield."
,action,"Jurgen Klopp has decided to make two changes to the Liverpool side that started the 1-1 draw with Manchester United last weekend, with Nathaniel Clyne and Philippe Coutinho returning to the starting line-up to replace Trent Alexander-Arnold and Divock Origi."
,action,"Swansea City substitutes: Nordfeldt, Amat, Rangel, Fulton, Dyer, McBurnie, Baston."
,action,"Swansea City XI (4-3-3): Fabianski; Naughton, Fernandez, Mawson, Olsson; Fer, Carroll, Cork; Routledge, Llorente, Sigurdsson."
,action,"Liverpool substitutes: Karius, Moreno, Matip, Lucas, Woodburn, Origi, Sturridge."
,action,"Liverpool XI (4-3-3): Mignolet; Clyne, Lovren, Klavan, Milner; Wijnaldum, Henderson, Can; Firmino, Coutinho, Lallana."
,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"Swansea have beaten Liverpool only once in the last nine league meetings between the two sides, but a rare win here today will temporary move them out of the relegation zone and up to 17th place. Despite sitting at the bottom, just one point separates the Swans and Crystal Palace, with Hull City and Sunderland, both of whom face tough clashes this weekend, sitting in between."
,action,"Whilst Liverpool battle to keep up with Chelsea, Swansea are desperately trying to find a way out of the relegation zone. It’s now almost a month and a half since the South Wales side were last outside of the bottom three, and they remain bottom of the table with 15 points after suffering a heavy 4-0 defeat at home to Arsenal last weekend."
,action,"It’s now over a year since they last lost a Premier League game at Anfield, with five of the last six fixtures ending in victories. Manchester City were the last team that failed to leave with at least a point, although both Sunderland and Manchester United managed to hold Jurgen Klopp’s men to draws in each of their previous two league games. As a result, a return to winning ways today is desperately needed."
,action,"Liverpool are finally in to the fourth round of the FA Cup thanks to Wednesday’s replay win against Plymouth Argyle, and their attention now turns to keeping the pressure firmly on league leaders Chelsea. A slight slump means that the Reds have won only one of their previous five games, although their home record remains incredibly impressive."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Premier League game between Liverpool and Swansea City at Anfield.
