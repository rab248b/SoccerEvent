,action,"That’s all for now, thanks for joining us!"
,action,"Tottenham advance to the 4th round of the FA Cup with relative ease against an Aston Villa side who came to White Hart Lane with a clear game plan that they couldn’t quite carry out for the full 90 minutes. Steve Bruce can now fully concentrate on Aston Villa’s Championship campaign, while Spurs continue to fight on three fronts with the Premier League and Europa League still on Pochettino’s radar."
,action,FULL TIME: TOTTENHAM 2-0 ASTON VILLA
90'+3',action,FINAL CHANCE! Well Son could have had at least a hat-trick today! Onomah beats Alan Hutton and put Son through one-on-one but he is once again thwarted by Johnstone. And there goes the final whistle!
90',action,There are going to be three minutes of additional time at the end of this FA Cup tie.
88',action,Jack Grealish hasn’t given up yet as he wins a free kick in Tottenham’s half after beating two Spurs players before being brought down by Carter-Vickers. McCormack puts the free kick over the bar.
85',action,"DOUBLE CHANCE!! Tottenham’s fresh legs are giving a tired Villa defence some trouble now. N’Koudou gets to the by-line and puts a low cross in that just avoids Onomah, before Dele Alli forces Johnstone to stick a foot out to block a pass across goal."
84',substitution,Substitution sub-out Moussa Sissoko sub-in Josh Onomah . The final change of the afternoon and it’s Sissoko who makes way for sub-in Josh Onomah for the final five minutes.
83',action,Aston Villa have battled hard this afternoon at White Hart Lane but there was always going to be a question of whether they could concentrate for the full 90 minutes when they’ve been under this much pressure. Ross McCormack chases a long ball going forward but is flagged for offside.
80',assist,Assist Moussa Sissoko. Sissoko makes up for his miss a few minutes earlier by cutting inside and unselfishly finding his teammate in the middle of the box to seal Tottenham place in the 4th round draw.
80',goal,Goal Heung-Min Son. GOOOAAALLLL!!! It’s all over now surely? Son Heung-min finally gets his goal as he places his shot in the corner after some good work from Sissoko on the right.
78',action,CHANCE! Moussa Sissoko should really do better as he’s put through one-on-one with Sam Johnstone but hits his shot straight at the ‘keeper.
77',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Gabriel Imuetinyan Agbonlahor sub-in Ross McCormack . Villa are trying something different here with a triple substitution, and sub-in Ross McCormack will now lead the line replacing the Gabby Agbonlahor."
77',substitution,Substitution sub-out Mile Jedinak sub-in Keinan Davis . Aston Villa are sacrificing a man in midfield to put on a second striker and it’s sub-out Mile Jedinak who makes way for sub-in Keinan Davis.
77',substitution,Substitution sub-out Albert Danquah Adomah sub-in Andre Green . Adomah’s stint as a defensive winger comes to an end as he’s replaced by sub-in Andre Green.
74',action,"Spurs have grown in confidence since scoring, especially Eric Dier, who has his free kick blocked by the wall before attempting a shot from 35 yards out that only finds the fans in the second tier of the stand behind the Villa goal."
71',assist,Assist Georges-Kevin N'Koudou Mbida. N’Koudou will be really happy to have made an impact that quickly! His ball in from the left evaded all the Villa defenders to find the Welsh full back for his first Tottenham goal.
71',goal,Goal Ben Davies. GOOOALLLL TOTTENHAM!!!! And what a change it was from Pochettino! Ben Davies is the unlikely scorer of a glancing header as he’s found unmarked in Villa’s box. Aston Villa now have just twenty minutes to reply to avoid defeat.
70',substitution,Substitution sub-out Toby Alderweireld sub-in Georges-Kevin N'Koudou Mbida . There’s a change in formation for Spurs now as N’Koudou is brought on for Alderweireld with Eric Dier dropping into centre back.
67',action,This game is coming to life now! Dele Alli does well down the left and finds Winks in the middle. His powerful shot is deflected and well held by Johnstone as the central midfielder attempted to open the scoring.
65',action,BIG CHANCE FOR VILLA!! Toby Alderweireld and Cameron Carter-Vickers have almost certainly just stopped Villa from going in front! A deep free kick from Jack Grealish finds the head of Alan Hutton who puts it back into the box before Carter-Vickers denied Chester a shot and Alderweireld got ahead of Agbonlahor in the six-yard box to put the ball behind.
62',action,ANOTHER CHANCE!! It’s Son again! He turns Nathan Baker and fires a powerful shot towards goal from the edge of the box and Johnstone does well to parry it and put the ball out for a corner.
60',substitution,Substitution sub-out Vincent Janssen sub-in Bamidele Alli . Pochettino needed to change something as Spurs just haven’t been able to find a way through Villa’s defences. Dele Alli has seven goals in his last four games and his side could really do with him adding to that tally again today. sub-out Vincent Janssen is the man to make way.
56',action,"Tottenham are once again dominating possession but similarly to the first half haven’t been able to find a way to break down the visitors. However, it looks like Tottenham’s in-form man is about to make an appearance…"
51',action,"CHANCE!! Well Son won’t want to see this again in a hurry. Kieran Trippier puts in a cross from the right that finds the winger at the far post in space, but he slashes at his shot and the ball is cleared. That was Tottenham’s best chance of the game and the South Korean should really have tested the debutant goalkeeper."
49',action,Villa have turned the tables on Spurs in the last couple of minutes and the home side are now the ones defending. Jack Grealish and Albert Adomah are linking up well on the left but haven’t been able to worry Michel Vorm.
47',action,"This half is already promising to be an improvement on the first as Vincent Janssen has his first shot on the target, however Johnstone safely claims his effort."
46',action,Aston Villa have the kick off and the second half begins!
,action,Both sides are back out on the pitch and we’re almost ready to get the second half underway!
,action,"Well it’s not been the most exciting 45 minutes of football but it’s clear to see why Aston Villa have gone from 19th to 12th in the Championship under Steve Bruce. The away side look organised and are proving hard to break down, and while Spurs have had a large share of possession, they’ve struggled to create any clear cut chances. It can only get better after half time…"
,action,HALF TIME: TOTTENHAM 0-0 ASTON VILLA
45',action,There will be no injury time in this half and it’s goalless here at White Hart Lane!
42',action,"CHANCE! Excellent work from Son as he plays a clever one-two with Vincent Janssen. The striker’s pass is deflected into the path of his teammate and only the outstretched leg of Jordan Amavi denies him a shot, but the Frenchman’s clearance loops over Sam Johnstone and almost finds the back of the net, narrowly going past the post."
40',action,All eleven Aston Villa players are in their own half when Tottenham’s centre backs are in possession and Alderweireld is forced to attempt long balls out wide. He finds Ben Davies who links up with Janssen and wins his side another corner but the home side can’t capitalise on the set piece.
36',action,"Some clever link up play between Moussa Sissoko, Son Heung-min and Ben Davies sees the latter drill a low cross into the box, but with only Vincent Janssen to aim at and Villa shirts crowding the area the ball is easily cleared. Spurs are moving the ball quickly but Aston Villa are sitting so deep that it’s having little effect."
33',action,"Kieran Trippier’s cross is deflected behind for Tottenham’s first corner of the game, and the resulting set piece finds Eric Dier but his flick doesn’t have enough power on it and Johnstone collects the loose ball."
30',action,"Jack Grealish puts in a curling delivery from a free kick that’s only half cleared, Albert Adomah puts the ball back into the box but James Chester and Nathan Baker challenge each other in the air and the ball is cleared."
28',action,"Leandro Bacuna has the first shot of the game, but it’s a speculative effort from 35 yards that curls harmlessly into the arms of Michel Vorm."
26',action,A really good challenge in the box from Nathan Baker denies Son Heung-min the chance to shoot as the South Korean sprinted through the channel. The game is just beginning to open up now.
23',action,"Steve Bruce recognised how difficult today’s tie was going to be regardless of how many changes Tottenham made and has drilled his side well while they’re not in possession. The defence and midfield both look very organised and are making it difficult for Spurs to break them down. As a result, neither side has managed a shot on goal so far."
21',action,Winks is looking good in possession so far and wins a free kick near the corner flag as Grealish brings him down. The ball’s put into the box and Sam Johnstone is called into action for the first time as he punches the ball clear.
19',action,Aston Villa have the first corner of the match after a deep free kick is put behind by Ben Davies. Jack Grealish delivers the cross but Eric Dier is fouled in the box and any danger is averted.
17',action,"Spurs look dangerous on the counter attack when Aston Villa do manage to push up, and a good run and pass from Harry Winks to Janssen ends when the striker runs out of options and is dispossessed on the edge of Villa’s box."
14',action,Gabby Agbonlahor is finding himself very isolated up front for Aston Villa at the moment. He manages to pick up the ball in a forward position however his cross only finds a cluster of white shirts as his teammates struggle to advance up the pitch.
12',action,"Aston Villa are working hard to close down Tottenham on the ball, however the Villains are struggling to maintain possession for any meaningful period of time. Albert Adomah and Jack Grealish are tracking Tottenham’s wing-backs when they don’t have possession meaning the away side are lining up with almost a back six at times."
8',action,Spurs are happy to switch play from wing to wing while Aston Villa flood the centre of the park. Kieran Trippier delivers a good cross towards Vincent Janssen but the striker is adjudged to be offside.
4',action,"The first exciting piece of play comes from Moussa Sissoko, who picks the ball up in his own half and drives past three Villa players before a good challenge at the back sees the ball cannon off his leg and go out for a goal kick."
3',action,"Spurs have settled more quickly into the game at this early stage and look sharp both with and without the ball, while Aston Villa are quite happy to let the home side pass the ball around at the back before putting pressure on the wing backs when the ball comes forward."
1',action,Spurs kick us off and we are underway!
,action,The teams are out and the handshakes are done which means kick-off is just moments away! Stay tuned for all the action from White Hart Lane for this FA Cup encounter!
,action,"Team News: As expected, Spurs have made nine changes to their last starting line-up, with only Toby Alderweireld and Eric Dier retaining their places. Pochettino sticks with the same formation that he used against Chelsea, with 19 year-old Cameron Carter-Vickers lining up as one of a back three alongside Alderweireld and Kevin Wimmer. Aston Villa have made four changes, with Sam Johnstone replacing Mark Bunn in goal for his Aston Villa debut having been brought in on loan from Manchester United."
,action,"ASTON VILLA Substitutes: Gollini, Elphick, Westwood, Cissokho, Green, Davis, McCormack."
,action,"ASTON VILLA Starting XI (4-2-3-1): Johnstone; Hutton, Chester, Baker, Amavi; Jedinak, Tshibola; Adomah, Bacuna, Grealish; Agbonlahor."
,action,"TOTTENHAM Substitutes: Lopez, Walker-Peters, Vertonghen, Wanyama, Alli, Onomah, N'Koudou."
,action,"TOTTENHAM Starting XI (3-4-2-1): Vorm; Carter-Vickers, Alderweireld, Wimmer; Trippier, Dier, Winks, Davies; Sissoko, Son; Janssen."
,action,"The teams are in, here’s how both sides line-up this afternoon, starting with the home side…"
,action,"Aston Villa have been hard to beat in the Championship this season, losing just six games. However, their inability to convert draws into wins sees them only sitting in twelfth, and a push for the play-offs this season looks unlikely but not impossible."
,action,"Tottenham’s win four days ago moved them up to third in the table, above Manchester City and Arsenal and are unbeaten in all competitions at home this season – a record they’ll be looking to maintain today."
,action,"Steve Bruce is likely to have Mile Jedinak available in the centre of midfield once again after missing their 1-0 defeat to Cardiff on Monday. Bruce is likely to field a strong side and has fond memories of the FA Cup, having won the competition three times with Manchester United as a player and leading Hull to the final three seasons ago as a manager."
,action,"Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino is likely to make widespread changes this afternoon as he looks to give some of the fringe players in the squad an opportunity. Erik Lamela is the only player unavailable through injury, but Pochettino is likely to give the likes of Michel Vorm, Ben Davies, Kieran Trippier and Vincent Janssen a chance to start."
,action,"Hello and welcome to our live match commentary of the third round FA Cup tie between Tottenham Hotspur and Aston Villa at White Hart Lane! Spurs come into this game off the back of ending Chelsea’s 13-game winning streak on Wednesday, while Aston Villa are a rejuvenated side under new boss Steve Bruce."
