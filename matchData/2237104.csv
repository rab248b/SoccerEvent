81',action,"Rennes are really starting to put PSG under-pressure at the back now, they're throwing plenty of players forward in an attempt to score an equalising goal. However they are unable to fashion any clear-cut chances, just shots from long-range."
78',action,"Andre forces Trapp into making a diving save! The midfielder had far too much time and space on the edge of the box and although the shot looked to be going wide, the PSG keeper made sure with the save. Corner to Rennes... Nothing comes of it."

62',action,"ANOTHER PENALTY SHOUT! Thiago Motta this time goes down in the box under-pressure from Costil, but once again the referee awards Rennes a free-kick for diving.

51',action,"Rennes are looking comfortable in possession at the moment. However PSG are pressing them high up the pitch, so it is mainly in their own half and are still struggling to put the visitors defence under any pressure."
49',action,"Brief stoppage in play as Marquinhos is down with a head injury, however he looks fine to continue."

A terrific finish from the German international, a first-time shot which curled into the bottom left-hand corner of the net after a pin-point path into his path by Verratti. The shot initially looked to be going wide but it eventually curled into the corner of the net. Fantastic start to his PSG career!"

However as the PSG players appeal for a penalty, the referee awards Rennes a free-kick for diving! Costil came diving in but no penalty is given. That looks to be a harsh call."
27',action,"Yoann Gourcuff looks to be the danger man for Rennes here today, he has just tried his luck from long-range but it doesn't threaten Trapp in the PSG net."

4',action,"PSG corner! Thiago Silva netted twice on Wednesday from corner-kicks, so the Rennes defence need to get a tight grip of the PSG skipper. The ball in is dealt with by Rennes but the visitors have the ball once more and Julian Draxler wins a free-kick down the left flank."
3',action,"Good start by the visitors, after that early chance they have enjoyed the vast majority of the ball and look eager to try and score an early goal here."
1',action,"HUGE CHANCE! IT SHOULD BE 1-0! Edison Cavani misses a brilliant chance to give PSG the lead after just 40 seconds!
