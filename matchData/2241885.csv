,action,"A few boos ring around Old Trafford as the referee blows his whistle for the final time. That's the first time that Manchester United have failed to win in four consecutive home league games since 1990, and it's a result with which they'll feel incredibly frustrated. They impressed after going behind early on and really should have kept that momentum going after the break, but they slowed down and sat back, which allowed West Ham to hold on to an important draw."
,action,FULL-TIME: MANCHESTER UNITED 1-1 WEST HAM UNITED
90'+4',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Dimitri Payet sub-in Sofiane Feghouli . West Ham have made a late alteration as they attempt to eat up some time, with Feghouli coming on to replace Payet, who was excellent al evening."

90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be four minutes of added time.
89',action,"Another chance for Fletcher! West Ham keep putting pressure on Manchester United as they try to steal a late winner, but the youngster is unable to guide his close-range shot through the wall of red shirts camped in front of him and the home side are just about able to hold on."
88',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Marouane Fellaini-Bakkioui. West Ham come back once again, this time through Noble, but the captain is clumsily fouled by Fellaini just outside of the penalty area on the right flank and wins his side a free-kick. The set-piece finds the head of Kouyate but the defender is penalised for a push in the back as soon as he sends his header wide of the goal."
87',action,"What an opportunity for Fletcher to win it for West Ham! The visitors break away on a quick counter-attack through Antonio, who bursts down the right wing on a brilliant run. He beats two players before teeing up Fletcher, who muscles his way through a sea of red shirts and unleashes a shot that De Gea does well to save at his near post."
86',action,"Chance for Pogba! Valencia fires a deep cross into the West Ham penalty area and picks out Pogba in a great position, but the Frenchman is unable to pull off an audacious bicycle kick and sees his effort deflect away from goal."

84',action,"West Ham break away quickly through Payet and Fletcher and initially look as if they're going to cause the home side plenty of problems, but they don't push forward quickly enough and, eventually, the young striker is dispossessed before he can get a shot away."
83',action,"Great defending by Kouyate! A terrible attempted header from Collins fails to find Randolph and is instead picked out by Ibrahimovic on the edge of the box, but as soon as he rounds the goalkeeper, he's dispossessed by a wonderful tackle from Kouyate."
81',action,"Another great save by Randolph! Manchester United break quickly through Rooney on the left wing before a deep cross picks out Ibrahimovic at the far-post, but the striker's first-time volley fails to beat the outstretched foot of the West Ham goalkeeper, who has performed brilliantly today."

Fletcher, who has seen little of the ball since coming on to the pitch, breaks into the right-hand side of the hosts' penalty area before fizzing a low pass across the face of goal, but there's nobody there to meet it and Valencia is just about able to clear the danger."
79',action,"Manchester United quickly win back the ball before Rooney swings a deep cross over to the far post. Ibrahimovic rises high above his marker and is just about able to make contact with the ball, but he's unable to do so well enough to hit the target with his glancing effort."

73',action,"A lovely cross-field pass from Lingard finds Valencia over on the right-hand side of the West Ham box, but the Ecuadorian is unable to get the better of Cresswell and, once again, the visitors are able to keep the determined home side at bay."
71',action,"Valencia cuts inside from the right wing and pokes a pass over to Ibrahimovic, who is camped on the byline, but the striker has to settle for another corner after failing to find a teammate with his back-heeled pass. Rooney's cross this time is better and finds Jones at the near post, but the defender can only knock the ball out for a goal-kick."
69',action,"Pogba battles his way down the right flank before winning his side a corner. It's whipped in by Rooney and sent towards the edge of the penalty area, but it's overhit and fails to find a red shirt before being easily dealt with by West Ham."

62',action,"Sloppy play by West Ham inside their own half of the pitch allows Pogba to pick up the ball and quickly poke it into the path of Rashford, but there's slightly too much power behind the pass and it fails to find the youngster before being dealt with by Randolph."
60',action,"Pogba twists and turns in the middle of the pitch before being dragged back by Noble, resulting in a free-kick for Manchester United inside their own half of the pitch. It's sent short and worked around patiently before Jones fires a long ball forward, but it fails to find Ibrahimovic and ends up bouncing out of play for a throw-in."
58',action,"Valencia charges down the right wing and latches on to a lofted pass forward before spinning and teeing up Herrera. The Spaniard is in a good position and does well to whip a cross into the penalty area, but it's underhit and easily dealt with by Collins."
56',action,"West Ham go close again! The resulting set-piece is curled over to the far post and finds Lanzini in an acre of space, allowing the Argentine to head the ball back across the face of goal.

55',action,"Payet and Lingard battle for the ball midway inside the West Ham half of the pitch before the latter drags the Frenchman to the ground and gives away a needless free-kick in a dangerous position.

53',action,"Sakho almost makes it 2-1! Antonio gets himself into a good position down the right wing once again before firing a cross off Rojo and out for a corner.

50',action,"A deep cross from Lingard fails to find Ibrahimovic in the middle of the West Ham penalty area but ends up bouncing out to Rashford.

48',action,"Lanzini does well to break through the middle of the pitch before working the ball over to Antonio on the right flank, but the wing-back's hopeful cross into the penalty area fails to find Sakho in front of goal and is instead easily headed away by Jones."

,action,"It was a perfect start for West Ham thanks to a lovely header from Sakho, but Manchester United have dominated possession since then and arguably deserve to be in front. They've continuously put the Hammers defence under plenty of pressure with near-constant attacks, but, so far, the visitors have only conceded the one goal and head into the half-time break with the scoreline level. It's going to be tough to keep this up for another 45 minutes, however."

,action,"The 1-1 draw at home to Arsenal last weekend will have been a bitter pill for the Red Devils to swallow after they looked almost certain to come away with all three points, and that result means that they currently sit in sixth place, five points behind Tottenham Hotspur. They will feel confident about their chances of winning here today, however, as they have only lost one of their previous 24 home games and will take on a West Ham team that are struggling at the wrong end of the table."
,action,"Thursday night’s thumping of Feyenoord showed that Manchester United still have the ability to carve opponents apart when they’re playing at their best, but Jose Mourinho will be well aware that his side desperately need to show their worth in the Premier League if they are to avoid falling too far behind their rivals in the race for a top-four finish."
