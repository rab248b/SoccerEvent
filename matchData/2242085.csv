,action,"And that will do it from the Stadium of Light as Sunderland twice fight back from a goal down, but fail to get the win that the so desperately needed. It was an entertaining game, filled with goals, red card, and emotion due to Jones' serious injury. A point apiece, but the Black Cats stay bottom. That's it from us, thanks for tuning in."
90'+10',action,"WIDE OF THE MARK! Anichebe, whose hold-up play has been excellent, works his way infield from the right-hand side, but his strike is sent off the mark to a loud groan from the fans."
90'+10',substitution,Substitution sub-out André Ayew Pelé sub-in Jonathan Calleri . Substitution  sub-out André Ayew Pelé sub-in Jonathan Calleri
90'+8',action,"That's horrible from Khazri, who takes a free-kick and fizzes it well over the bar. He apologises to his teammates."
90'+7',action,"All hands to the pump for both sides as Sunderland, fighting for their Premier League lives, keep hurling the ball towards the West Ham penalty area. Incredible finish to this dramatic game."
90'+5',yellow-red,"Yellow/Red Sam Byram. BYRAM IS SENT OFF! Well I can't say that I'm surprised as he's looked vulnerable all game. He clatters right into Borini down the flank to stop a counter, and the referee had no choice but to show him a second yellow."
90'+2',action,That wasn't a true 90th minute goal since Jones' injury means that there's 10 minutes of added time! Sunderland will surely believe that they can win this.
90',goal,"Goal Fabio Borini. BORINI HAS DONE IT! SUNDERLAND HAVE DONE IT! A hopeful ball into the box is fumbled terribly by Randolph and with the keeper out of position, the substitute lashes in a fine finish!"
89',substitution,Substitution sub-out Javier Manquillo Gaitán sub-in Lamine Koné . Kone is on to replace Manquillo.
88',substitution,Substitution sub-out Billy Jones sub-in Fabio Borini . sub-out Billy Jones is applauded off and on comes sub-in Fabio Borini in his place.
85',action,We can only wish all the best for Jones. He's being strapped to a stretcher and is also wearing what looks like an oxygen mask. Concern all around the Stadium of Light.
83',action,"Jones is still down on the deck here, and there is real concern over his well-being. Surely he won't be able to continue and it doesn't even look like he's been conscious for the entire time that he's been down."
81',substitution,Substitution sub-out Robert Snodgrass sub-in Håvard Nordtveit . Snodgrass makes his way off an on comes the ex-Arsenal man Havard Nordtveit.
79',action,"Ouch. Billy Jones and Masuaku go tussling for a ball down the line, and the Sunderland man goes down hard on his shoulder. That looked painful."
76',substitution,Substitution sub-out Lee Cattermole sub-in Adnan Januzaj . First change of the game as Cattermole is withdrawn for sub-in Adnan Januzaj. The defesive midfielder was involved in more than his fair share of attacking plays.
73',action,"HE SKIES IT! That wa a golden chance for Sunderland to draw level. Khazri's godly first touch takes down a long ball and moves him past his man in one swoop. He squares for Ndong inside the area, but he sends it over when it would have been easier to score."
70',yellow-card,Yellow Card Sam Byram. Byram belatedly gets booked for bringing down his man on the edge of the area. Khazri takes the resulting free-kick but blazes it onto the roof of the net.
67',action,"Sunderland will be happy that they've managed to limit West Ham since the visitors scored the second, but they really need to start creating more, and not just playing it up for Anichebe and hoping for the best."
64',action,The tempo of the game has slowed down somewhat in the last few minutes with no good chances to speak of. West Ham are being pushed back a little more than they would have liked.
61',action,"Just over an hour gone and surprisingly no sign of any changes as yet. Not that anyone is playing particularly badly, but Pickford and Ayew have been among those who have taken noticeable knocks in this game."
58',action,"A lovely, sweeping move from the home side sees the ball move from box to box with a series of one-touch passes, but Defoe is challenged on the edge of the aea before he can get a shot away."
55',action,"Anichebe rises well to pluck a high ball out of the sky and play it into the feet of Defoe, who keeps his defender at arm's length before laying it off for his strike partner, who couldn't shape to shoot in time."
53',action,"VITAL BLOCK FROM FONTE! Khazri, who has looked active in the second half, plays a great ball into the area for Defoe to attack at the near post, but the defender puts him off his finish excellently!"
50',action,"Once again, Sunderland concede a goal in the first seconds after the restart. They have it all to do again after conceding an early gol in the first half as well."
47',assist,Assist Robert Snodgrass. Great corner from Snodgrass.
47',goal,"Goal James Collins. WEST HAM STRIKE AGAIN! Snodgrass whips in a peach of a corner and with Pickford pinned to the line, Collins gets his head on it to glance it home!"
46',action,Off we go again.
,action,"And that will do it for now as it's all square between West Ham and Sunderland. Ayew's early goal was cancelled out by a stunning leveller from Khazri, and both sides will feel that they have what it takes to win this game. Stay tuned for the restart soon."
45'+1',action,"SAVED BY THE KEEPER! Defoe wriggles one way then another at the top of the box before cleverly laying the ball off for Khazri, whose strike is saved smartly down low by Randolph!"
43',action,"Anichebe holds the ball up well and takes Byam out of the equation. He plays the ball into the path of Cattermole, who is challenged by Snodgrass in the box, but the midfielder got that tackle spot on."
40',action,"SCRAMBLE! Pinball in the West Ham box as Ndong's cross causes all sorts of problems inside the area. Cattermole and Anichebe both take swings at it, but it's eventually cleared for a corner which comes to nothing."
38',action,Pickford clearly isn't playing at 100 per cent here as he winces again after a goal-kick. He had knee problems earlier in the season. Will Sunderland try to get him to soldier on until the break?
36',action,"MY WORD! Sunderland somehow escape conceding again. Snodgrass flashes a dangerous ball across the face of goal, and Carroll cuts it back, only for Ayew to spoon the finish over on the spin!"
33',action,"This is turning out to be a cracking game, with both sides looking capable of more goals. There's a little concern for Pickford, who appears to be limping somewhat."
30',action,"Let's talk about that goal, shall we? Incredible stuff from Khazri, but Anichebe played a vital role, blocking off Randolph and preventing him from getting where he needed to be to guard against the corner. In basketball, they'd call that a hard screen."
28',action,"Even though that play was not a penalty, it must be worrying for Bilic that Byram always seems to be caught in these last-ditch defensive scrambles."
26',goal,Goal Wahbi Khazri. IT'S GONE STRAIGHT IN! What a sight that was! Kahzri took the corner and bent it right into the back of the net via the base of the far post!
26',action,"PENALTY? Defoe races across Byram en route to the area and goes down as the keeper comes out to make the gap small. It would have been a soft one though, and the referee is right to stand pat."
23',action,"Sunderland try something different from a free-kick on the left-hand side. With everyone piled deep in the box, Khazri plays it square to the top of the D for Gibson to race onto, but the latter was a step too slow to connect with it and sends it wide."
20',action,"WIDE OF THE MARK! Fernandes and Lanzini link up, with the latter shaping to shoot on his right foot. However, he surprises everyone by laying it off to Snodgrass, who shifts onto his left and misses the target."
17',action,"Still only the one goal in this one, and there haven't been many other chances to speak of. Both tams are still trying to settle into this game."
15',action,Now it's West Ham's turn to be frustrated as a goal-kick is given despite the ball looking to knock off the left foot of Anichebe after he tussled with Byram for the ball near the byline.
12',action,"Gibson tries to ping a first-time ball to meet the run of Defoe, which wasn't a bad one, but James Collins is in position to mop things up."
10',action,"The home fans are aggrieved as they feel that a few decisions have gone against them so far. Their team have attacked decently, but just switched off for one vital possession."
7',action,Fourth goal in seven now for Ayew who is finally starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel after a tortuous season peppered with injuries.
5',goal,"Goal André Ayew Pelé. WEST HAM STORM INTO THE LEAD! A deep cross to the back post finds Carroll taking the shot on the volley. It's scuffed so badly that it ends up being a cross, and Andre Ayew gambled with a dart down the centre to bundle it home."
4',action,"Sunderland are forced to defend in numbers as West Ham swam around their box, but they get a chance to break as Cattermole charges forward, with Victor Anichebe running across Sam Byram and losing his balance, but the referee waves play on."
1',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Lee Cattermole. Surprise, surprise, Lee Cattermole is booked within the first few seconds for a rough challenge."
1',action,Off we go!
,action,"Andy Carroll returns to captain the Hammers, while Edmilson Fernandes is also handed a start. Those are Slaven Bilic's only changes from the win against Swansea, with the suspended Mark Noble and the injured Michail Antonio dropping out."
,action,"Sebastian Larsson begins his three-game suspension after being sent off against Manchester United. Bryan Oviedo is also missing, while Lamine Kone and Jack Rodwell are benched. John O'Shea, Javi Manquillo, Darren Gibson and Wahbi Khazri return to the XI."
,action,"West Ham (4-4-1-1): Randolph; Byram, Collins, Fonte, Masuaku; Ayew, Fernandes, Kouyate, Snodgrass; Lanzini; Carroll."
,action,"Sunderland (4-1-3-2): Pickford; Jones, O'Shea, Denayer, Manquillo; Cattermole, Ndong, Gibson, Khazri; Defoe, Anichebe."
,action,"West Ham's 1-0 triumph over Swansea was their first win in eight tries, which halted a worrying slide down the table. They should be safe from the drop barring an incredible collapse, but with 57 goals conceded in 32 games, their defence is still a real concern."
,action,"Its only the most optimistic Sunderland fans who believe that their side can still beat their latest battle with relegation. They've won five of their 31 games so far, and will need to win that many in the remaining seven to make that a possibility."
,action,Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Sunderland's Premier League match with West Ham at the Stadium of Light. The Black Cats are bottom of the pile and facing a 10-point gap from safety. They face a Hammers side that have only recently returned to winning ways.
