,action,"Despite being tested in the first half, it was a relatively easy afternoon for City, who, once they went 2-0 up, were comfortably able to hold on to three well-earned points. Sunderland's heads seemed to drop after Sane beat Pickford with a delightful shot, and from then onwards they seemed to be content to sleepwalk their way to another defeat that leaves them bottom of the table."
,action,FULL-TIME: SUNDERLAND 0-2 MANCHESTER CITY
90'+3',action,"De Bruyne breaks towards the Sunderland penalty area before finding Sagna deep down the right wing. The Frenchman takes a quick touch and then fires a low cross into the path of Aguero, but, just as it looks as if the striker is going to make it 3-0, he's beaten to the ball by a great interception from O'Shea."
90'+2',action,"Aguero drops deep to pick up the ball in the middle of the pitch and does well to tee up De Bruyne over on the right flank. The Belgian cuts into the penalty area and tests Pickford with another low shot, but, once again, the young goalkeeper pulls off an excellent diving save."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be three minutes of added time.
89',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Leroy Sané sub-in Fabian Delph . City have made their final substitution of the game, with Sane making way for sub-in Fabian Delph."
88',action,"Great save by Pickford! This time it's Aguero who is able to get a shot away from the edge of the Sunderland box, but Pickford pulls off a wonderful diving stop to deny the Argentine his second goal of the game."
87',action,"De Bruyne is left in a pocket of space just outside of the Sunderland penalty area and is presented with a chance to shoot, but his curling effort flies straight into the hands of Pickford in the middle of the goal."
85',action,"Larsson carelessly concedes possession in the middle of the pitch and allows Aguero to fly towards the penalty area on a frantic run, but the Argentine is unable to beat Pickford from 25 yards out and sees his low effort well saved by the goalkeeper."
83',action,"Defoe scores, but it's ruled out! Sunderland win themselves a corner over on the right flank, which is curled into the middle of the box and headed over to Defoe. The striker is completely unmarked in front of goal and easily beats Caballero, but he's at least five yards offside and the linesman's flag is quickly raised."
82',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Adnan Januzaj sub-in Wahbi Khazri . Meanwhile, sub-in Wahbi Khazri has replaced Januzaj for Sunderland."
82',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Raheem Shaquille Sterling sub-in Manuel Agudo Durán . City have made a late alteration, with Sterling making way for Nolito."
81',action,"City keep holding on to possession deep inside the Sunderland half of the pitch, but they're unable to find a way through the sea of red and white shirts camped in front of them and they have to settle for a throw-in deep down the left wing."
79',action,"Kolarov charges into the Sunderland half of the pitch on a marauding run before teeing up Sane over on the left-hand side of the hosts' penalty area, but the German is unable to get the better of Jones this time and the defender comes out on top."
78',substitution,Substitution sub-out Gnégnéri Yaya Touré sub-in Kevin De Bruyne . Toure is serenaded by the travelling City fans as he makes way for sub-in Kevin De Bruyne in the visitors' second change of the game.
76',action,"The life has been well and truly sucked out of this contest, which is now anything but. Sunderland are sleepwalking to another defeat as City patiently pass the ball around them as they try to run down the clock as quickly as they can."
74',action,"Sane twists and turns as he dances his way into the box and towards the near post, but he holds on to the ball for slightly too long and eventually fires a close-range shot off the leg of Kone and out for a corner, which fails to result in an opportunity on goal."
72',action,"A slight mix-up between Jones and Rodwell allows Sane to pick up the ball and fly into the left-hand side of the Sunderland penalty area, but Pickford does well to read the danger and rushes out to blast the ball out for a throw-in."
70',action,"Vital header by Kone! Sunderland lose the ball in the middle of the pitch and allow Sterling to curl a dangerous cross into the heart of the hosts' penalty area, but it fails to find Aguero thanks to a great clearance from Kone."
69',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Darron Gibson sub-in Jack Rodwell . Gibson seems to have picked up an injury after going down off the ball, and he gingerly makes his way off the pitch to be replaced by sub-in Jack Rodwell."
68',action,"Chance for Januzaj! Oviedo is left in a pocket of space over on the left wing and does well to curl a cross right on to the head of Januzaj, but, after doing well to reach the ball, the Belgian is unable to guide his glancing header on target."
67',action,"Toure twists and turns on the edge of the Sunderland penalty area as he tries to find the space needed to unleash a shot, but he's unable to do so and Gibson eventually pokes the ball away from him."
65',action,"Silva embarks on another great run as he weaves his way through the middle of the pitch. He heads towards the Sunderland box before teeing up Clichy to his left, but the Frenchman's cross into the box is poor and sails comfortably over the head of Aguero."
63',action,"It's all City at the moment as they comfortably hold on to possession inside the hosts' half of the pitch. The Sunderland players' heads seem to have dropped, and they're not closing down their opponents with the speed and intensity that was evident earlier in the game."
61',action,"Two chances for Sunderland! Ndong breaks into the right-hand side of the City penalty area and heads towards the byline before setting up Larsson, who then forces Caballero into making a great save with his feet at the near post. The ball spins out for a corner, which is quickly curled right on to the head of Kone, but the defender is unable to beat Caballero with his downward header."
59',assist,"Assist David Josué Jiménez Silva. Silva, who has played an important role in all of City's best attacking moves, did well to break forward before setting up Sane, but Sunderland were caught on the break and left far too much room available in the middle of the pitch."
59',goal,"Goal Leroy Sané. GOAL! It's 2-0 to City! Sunderland leave gaps available in the middle of the pitch and allow Silva to fly forward on a quick run. The Spaniard does so before threading a lovely pass through to Sane, who skips past Jones and fires a great strike into the back of the net via the far post."
57',action,"Silva goes close! City come back once again as they continue putting plenty of pressure on Sunderland's back line, and Silva is eventually able to unleash a thumping shot from the edge of the box that's well saved by Pickford."
56',action,"Ouch! Oviedo flies into Sterling and catches him from behind with a late challenge, but the referee only decides to give the defender a talking to before awarding City a free-kick. It's sent short and worked over to Aguero, but the Ivorian is unable to get the better of O'Shea on the edge of the penalty area."
55',action,"Januzaj darts down the right wing before taking on Kolarov, but he's unable to get the better of the defender and has to settle for a throw-in. It's taken quickly and sent back to the Belgian, who then pokes a lovely pass into the path of Ndong, but the midfielder's run into the penalty area is slightly mistimed and the linesman's flag is quickly raised as a result."
54',action,"Silva and Toure play a series of quick passes between themselves as they desperately try to find a way through the sea of Sunderland players camped in front of them, but they're unable to do so and the Spaniard eventually has the ball poked away from him by Larsson."
52',action,"Poor play by Sagna! Silva dances his way towards the Sunderland penalty area before setting up Sagna with a lovely flicked pass, but the Frenchman's first-time cross-cum-shot is woefully hit and sails well wide of the goal. Aguero doesn't look best pleased with that effort!"
50',action,"Toure and Silva link up well on the edge of the Sunderland penalty area before the latter tees up Sterling. The winger cuts inside quickly and then fires another cross into the box, but it's poorly hit and fails to find a team-mate in front of goal."
48',action,"Almost a chance for Defoe! The ball pinballs around the City penalty area dangerously before rolling out to Gibson. The midfielder immediately unleashes a thumping strike that deflects off Toure and into the feet of Defoe, but just as he's about to shoot, the striker is flagged offside."
47',action,"Oviedo is caught out by Sterling over on the right flank and allows the City winger to burst forward on a dangerous run before firing a cross into the penalty area, but it's poorly hit and sails straight into the hands of Pickford."
46',action,We're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"It's been a tough game for City so far, but they nonetheless head into the half-time break with a one-goal lead thanks to a well-worked goal right at the end. Up until then, Sunderland had defended well and went close to scoring through a rocket of a shot from Defoe, but the visitors were finally able to increase the tempo just three minutes before half-time and were rewarded with a clever close-range finish from Aguero."
,action,HALF-TIME: SUNDERLAND 0-1 MANCHESTER CITY
45'+1',action,"Silva scores, but it's ruled out! Aguero cuts inside from the left wing and darts into the penalty area before teeing up Silva via Sterling, but the latter is caught slightly offside and the linesman's flag is raised as soon as the Spaniard fires a low strike under the body of Pickford."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be just one minute of added time.
44',action,"Sunderland quickly push forward from the restart as they try to find a way back into the game. A lofted pass is fired over to the right flank and finds Jones in a promising position, but he's pushed off the ball by Sane and is unable to keep the ball in play. The Sunderland players and fans all scream for a free-kick, but the referee isn't interested and waves play on."
42',goal,"Goal Sergio Leonel Agüero del Castillo. GOAL! City have taken the lead! Toure charges through the middle of the pitch on yet another strong run. He works the ball over to Silva, who then tees up Sterling, and the winger's cross towards the near post sets up Aguero to lift a wonderful shot into the back of the net."
41',action,"Sterling and Sagna try to play a quick one-two between themselves as they attempt to get City back into the game, but the winger's pass back to the Frenchman is poor and rolls harmlessly out of play for a throw-in. Pep Guardiola looks frustrated over on the touchline."
39',action,"Jones goes close again! The right-back cuts inside from the right wing and picks out Defoe, who then spins round Toure and unleashes a low shot that deflects out for another Sunderland corner. Once again, the cross into the box is a good one, and Jones' header bounces just wide of the near post."
37',action,"What an opportunity by Silva! Toure and Sane link up beautifully before the German out-muscles Jones and fizzes a fierce pass across the face of goal, but there's slightly too much power behind it and it results in the ball flying just inches past Silva's outstretched foot."
35',action,"Chance for Jones! Januzaj picks up the ball on the edge of the City box before teeing up Jones to his right, and the full-back then curls a cross off the head of Kolarov and out for a corner. Januzaj's cross from the set-piece is a great one and finds the head of Jones, but his downward header is well saved by Caballero in the middle of the goal."
34',action,"What a pass by Toure! The Ivorian is able to charge through the middle of the pitch unopposed before teeing up Sterling with an excellent through-ball that flies past Oviedo and into the feet of the City winger, but the latter started his run slightly too early and is flagged offside just as he's about to shoot."
33',action,"Fernandinho tries to take Pickford by surprise with a thumping, long-range strike from the resulting free-kick, but it's poorly hit and comfortably sails straight into the hands of the young goalkeeper."
31',yellow-card,"Yellow Card John O'Shea. An attempted Sunderland attack breaks down, and City quickly hit them on a counter-attack. Aguero flies into the hosts' half of the pitch before taking on O'Shea, but he's cynically fouled by the centre-back as he tries to skip past him."
31',action,"Toure spots a run forward from Aguero and tries to teep up the Argentine with a lofted pass over the top of the Sunderland defence. Aguero skips past O'Shea and sprints towards the ball, but his run is slightly mistimed and results in the linesman's flag being quickly raised."
29',action,"Another patient attacking move from City fails to result in a chance on goal. Sunderland are constantly putting plenty of men behind the ball to frustrate their opponents, who are lacking the urgency needed to carve open the home side."
27',action,"City patiently knock the ball around on the edge of the Sunderland penalty area before Yaya Toure sends a lovely flick over the head of Darron Gibson and on to the head of Sterling. He's unable to fully control the ball, however, and Oviedo does well to come out on top thanks to a strong tackle at the right moment."
25',action,"A thumping, long-range pass flies over to the right flank and finds Sterling in a promising position, but the winger is unable to beat Oviedo and the full-back comes out on top before comfortably clearing the danger."
24',action,"It's been a really good 10-minute period for Sunderland, who have looked dangerous when pushing forward and are pressing well in the middle of the pitch. As a result, City have found it difficult to cause the hosts too many problems in and around their penalty area."
22',action,"After dealing with the danger, City break away quickly down the left wing. Sane and Fernandinho play a lovely one-two between themselves before the German darts into the Sunderland box, but he holds on to the ball for slightly too long and ends up running it out of play for a goal-kick."
21',action,"Larsson sends a great lofted pass down the right flank and into the Jones, who chips the ball over the top of Kolarov before winning the home side a corner. Januzaj steps up and curls a deep cross on to the head of Jones, but the full-back is unable to stop the ball from sailing over to the left flank."
20',action,"Two great chances for Sunderland! Defoe unleashes a brilliant strike from 25 yards out that beats Caballero before hitting the post. The ball then bounces out to Borini and finds the Italian unmarked inside the penalty area, but he's unable to guide his follow-up header towards goal."
18',action,"Lovely play by Januzaj! The Belgian showcases wonderful skills as he dribbles his way through a group of blue shirts and towards the penalty area, but he's unable to tee up Defoe as his slightly overhit pass can only find the hands of Caballero."
17',action,"Silva's corner is a good one and almost finds Fernandinho in front of goal, but, again, it's well dealt with by Sunderland. Borini then tries to break away on a swift counter-attack down the left wing, but Bacary Sagna is there to beat the Italian to the ball on the halfway line."
16',action,"Sunderland just can't seem to break out of their own half of the pitch. City keep pushing forward as they try to carve out another chance on goal, but Aguero is unable to dance his way into the penalty area and, under pressure from Larsson, has to settle for a corner."
15',action,"Almost a mix-up at the back! A tame cross from Silva trickles into the Sunderland box and towards Jordan Pickford. O'Shea decides to leave the ball for his goalkeeper to deal with, despite Sterling lurking just behind them. However, the young shot-stopper is just about able to dive on the loose ball before Sterling can get a toe on it."
13',action,"Silva twists and turns as he weaves his way down the left wing, but he's unable to find a way past Sebastian Larsson and is clumsily fouled by the Swedish midfielder, resulting in a free-kick for City in a promising position. Silva steps up and curls a dangerous cross into the heart of the box, where it's well dealt with by the hosts' defence."
11',action,"City quickly move the ball around midway inside the Sunderland half of the pitch before Fernandinho fizzes a first-time pass up towards Silva on the edge of the penalty area, but the Spaniard is unable to reach the ball and loses out to John O'Shea."
9',action,"City lose the ball on the halfway line and allow Sunderland to hit them on a quick counter, but Borini is unable to pick out Defoe with his lofted pass forward and sends it a few yards over the head of the striker."
8',action,"Silva is left in a pocket of space in the middle of the pitch and is able to break forward quickly before teeing up Sterling to his right, but the winger is unable to get the better of Oviedo and has to settle for a corner that Adnan Januzaj does well to clear at the near post."
6',action,"David Silva and Leroy Sane link up well deep down the left flank before the latter tries to tee up Sergio Aguero with a cross towards the near post, but Lamine Kone is just about able to get a foot on the ball to stop it from finding the Argentine."
5',action,"Sunderland go close! The hosts battle hard in the middle of the pitch before Fabio Borini unleashes a rocket of a shot from 30 yards out. It deflects off the stomach of Kolarov and out to Billy Jones, who then skips past Gael Clichy far too easily before firing a low cross into the middle of the box, but Jermain Defoe is unable to make decent contact with the ball and sends it spinning into the hands of Willy Caballero."
3',action,"City manage to carve out an early chance on goal after Bryan Oviedo is unable to deal with a lofted pass forward from Aleksandar Kolarov. It flies towards the edge of the penalty area and finds Raheem Sterling, who then knocks the ball back to Fernandinho, but the Brazilian unleashes an overhit shot that sails safely over the top of the crossbar."
1',action,"We're off! City get us underway, attacking from right to left."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."
,action,"David Moyes has decided to name an unchanged Sunderland side to the one that started the defeat against Everton, whilst City boss Pep Guardiola has made five changes to the team that featured in their last outing, with Willy Caballero, Bacary Sagna, Aleksandar Kolarov, Yaya Toure and David Silva coming into the starting line-up to replace Claudio Bravo, Pablo Zabaleta, Nicolas Otamendi, Aleix Garcia and Kevin De Bruyne, respectively."
,action,"Manchester City substitutes: Bravo, Otamendi, Fernando, Delph, Nolito, De Bruyne, Iheanacho."
,action,"Manchester City XI (4-3-3): Caballero; Sagna, Stones, Kolarov, Clichy; Fernandinho, Toure, Silva; Sterling, Aguero, Sane."
,action,"Sunderland substitutes: Mannone, Love, Manquillo, Djilobodji, Honeyman, Rodwell, Khazri."
,action,"Sunderland XI (4-5-1): Pickford; Jones, O’Shea, Kone, Oviedo; Januzaj, Ndong, Gibson, Larsson, Borini; Defoe."
,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon..."
,action,"It took a late own-goal from Paddy McNair to steal a nervy victory for City in August’s meeting at the Etihad Stadium, and that win means that today’s visitors have left victorious in each of the last six meetings between the two sides. It’s now almost three and a half years since Sunderland last beat City, although that win - and each of their previous four - have all finished 1-0 on this very ground."
,action,"City have looked like a well-oiled machine in recent weeks, bagging themselves 10 goals in just two games. They managed to score five times against both Monaco and Huddersfield Town, whilst at the back, where their defending had been slightly suspect earlier in the campaign, they have seemed far more solid since the start of the year."
,action,"As for their opponents, things couldn’t be more different for them. Only Everton have managed to beat City in their previous 11 games, with all of their last three Premier League clashes resulting in victories for the top-four chasers. They start the day in fourth place after Liverpool’s win yesterday but can climb back up to third if they pick up what should be a routine victory this afternoon."
,action,"Defensive frailties have proven to be Sunderland’s main problem this season, resulting in them shipping 48 goals in 26 league games. That leakiness at the back was on show in each of their last two outings, with Southampton comfortably putting four past them before Everton found the back of the net twice in yet another defeat for David Moyes’ struggling side."
,action,"Bar the 4-0 thumping of Crystal Palace at the start of the month, Sunderland have had little to smile about in recent weeks as they continue to struggle at the foot of the Premier League table. With just one win from their last nine league games, the Black Cats are quickly running out of time to pull off an escape from the bottom three, and, after the south London side's victory against West Bromwich Albion yesterday, the gap between themselves and 17th-place Palace now stands at six points."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Premier League game between Sunderland and Manchester City at the Stadium of Light.
