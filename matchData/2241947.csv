,action,"Full-time and Bournemouth come away from the Liberty Stadium with a comfortable 3-0 victory. That's all from us this evening, thanks for joining us throughout this Premier League clash."
90'+2',action,McBurnie has been useful for Swansea since coming on. He's offered himself as a target in the area and attack at every opportunity possible when the home side have managed to get forward in this match.
90',action,"Bradley may have departed the club, but the results are still the same for Swansea and they're been dominated this evening. A lot to be done for the new manager, whoever that may be."
89',substitution,Substitution sub-out Andrew Surman sub-in Dan Gosling . Bournemouth's final sub as Gosling comes on for Surman.
88',goal,Goal Joshua King. GOAL! King paces behind the Swansea defence and coolly slots the ball past Fabianski as Bournemouth break admirably from a Swans corner.
88',assist,Assist Charlie Daniels. Daniels receives the ball from Boruc and carries the ball 20 yards before threading a wonderful pass behind the high defensive line of Swansea for King to rush on to.
88',action,"There's just simply a lack of commitment for Swansea at the moment, when deliveries come into the box there are only two or three in the area. Considering Bournemouth have a poor defensive record in the league of late, it's an alarming lack of desire."
85',action,Maybe we spoke to soon! Another great cross from Naughton this evening almost finds McBurnie in the box as he rises high but just misses the ball in the air.
83',action,Seems as if this match is starting to die down in tempo as Bournemouth look happy to defend the lead they've acquired with little stress as Swansea try and fail to break them down.
81',action,"Dyer is looking slightly troublesome for Swansea as he tried to go at Francis at pace, but the winger slipped as he tried to cross into the box and sliced it out for a goal kick."
79',action,"Well, in all our years of watching football we've never seen a linesman's flag break, but there's a first time for everything as they play is brought to a halt to sort a replacement."
77',action,"Almost another opportunity for Afobe as King gets to the byline with the ball and cuts a pass back into the box, but his strike partner is unable to control the play in Swansea's penalty area and the defence hooks it clear."
75',action,"McBurnie almost gets his first Premier League goal as the young striker rises high in the box and directs a header at Boruc, but the Polish goalkeeper does well to pounce on the effort and keep hold of it."
73',substitution,Substitution sub-out Ryan Fraser sub-in Joshua King . Fraser also comes off for King.
73',substitution,Substitution sub-out Junior Stanislas sub-in Adam Smith . Stanislas comes off for sub-in Adam Smith.
73',action,"Mistake at the back from Taylor allows Francis to get pass him and attempt to play a cross into the Swansea box, but fortunately for the full-back Jordi Amat comes across to block the attempt into the middle."
71',action,"Despite Swansea looking a tad more dangerous, their time on the ball hasn't increased significantly and they must press higher up and stress Bournemouth if they wish to grab a goal."
69',action,"Bournemouth still have this element of authority as they look for their second win on the road this season, but Swansea are starting to look better as we approach the final 20 minutes of the match."
66',substitution,Substitution sub-out Leon Britton sub-in Jack Cork . Cork comes on for Britton as the midfielder goes off holding his thigh.
66',action,"Swansea are only looking dangerous from free-kicks and this time it's Taylor who tries his luck from outside the box, but his volley flies well over Boruc's crossbar and into the stands."
64',action,This time it was Stanislas with the fantastic pass to slide Afobe in away from the Swansea defence but Fabianski reads the danger well and rushes out to narrow down the angle on the striker and saves his effort.
62',action,Wilshere is running this match for Bournemouth and Swansea are unable to get the ball off him. He's be gliding around the pitch and picking fantastic passes all afternoon.
60',action,"Dyer finds himself with a chance in a similar position again as a free-kick is headed clear, but this time it's Stanislas to charges down the effort from the Swansea winger to prevent Boruc from being tested."
58',action,"Cries of handball is coming from the home side and support as Barrow heads to Llorente into the box, but the referee waves away the call and Bournemouth counter-attack!"
57',substitution,Substitution sub-out Fernando Llorente Torres sub-in Oliver McBurnie . McBurnie comes off the bench for only the third time this season as Llorente is withdrawn.
56',action,"Wilshere carries the ball at the Swansea defence confidently and offloads the ball to the right, allowing Stanislas to shift the play out of his feet and fire across goal but his effort is just wide of the mark."
54',action,"A deep free-kick from Sigurdsson is headed clear by the Bournemouth defence but only as far as Dyer just inside of the box, but the winger is unable to make clean strike with the ball as he's rushed into his effort but the away side's defence."
52',action,"CHANCE! Afobe does brilliantly to carry the ball inside from the left wing, riding two tackles in the process, but all the striker has left to do was pass to an overlapping Stanislas but his effort was tame and Ki intercepts."
50',action,"Swansea are allowing Bournemouth to reset their attacks time and time again as Llorente is dropping deep to assist in winning the ball back, but the Swans keep clearing the ball by pumping it forward to the Cherries' defence."
48',action,The second half has started in a similar way in which the first ended with the tempo being dictated by the away side and the hosts merely spectating the ball.
46',action,Swansea get the second half underway!
,action,"So far so good for Bournemouth who lead 2-0 going into the half time break and have commanded this match throughout. Swansea have a mountain to climb if they want any chance of getting on the score sheet, let alone rescuing something from this match."
45'+1',assist,Assist Junior Stanislas. Stanislas turns the ball across goal as he breaks behind the Swansea defence to allow Fraser to double Bournemouth's lead.
45'+1',goal,"Goal Ryan Fraser. GOAL! However, now it's 2-0! A one-two between Wilshere and Stanislas puts the winger through on goal but he decided to go for the selfless option and Fraser smashes home from four yards out."
45',action,"A wonderful clipped pass from Wilshere is clipped over the Swansea defence to Stanislas, but despite putting the ball in the net the winger is judged to be narrowly offside as the score remains 1-0."
43',action,"Arter tries his luck from range as Bournemouth ping the ball around and Afobe lays the ball off for the midfielder with his back to goal, but his effort is dragged wide of the right post."
41',action,Half time is on the horizon and in all honesty Swansea need it. It's clear they're unable to even get a hold of the ball and when they do options are few and far between. A tactical switch-up is definitely needed.
39',action,STAT: Swansea have scored nine goals in their last three home matches in the Premier League.
38',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Leroy Fer sub-in Modou Barrow . First sub of the match as Barrow comes on for Fer - appears to be tactical, rather than an injury."
37',action,"Bournemouth are firmly parked in Swansea's half now and they're dictating the match with ease, very few white shirts are able to get anywhere near the visitors as they shift the ball around the pitch."
35',action,"Amat gives away a cheap foul on the edge of the box, right in front of the referee, to present another opportunity for the Cherries to get a shot on goal, but the effort was an easy take for Fabianski."
34',yellow-card,Yellow Card Jordi Amat Maas. Jordi Amat collects a yellow card for his foul.
33',action,This is going to be a real task for Swansea to find their way back into this match for as long as Bournemouth calmly knock the ball around the pitch. The home side are enduring long spells without possession despite being a goal behind.
31',action,CHANCE! A fantastic cross into the box from Stanislas from a free-kick is completely wasted as all the Bournemouth players fail to attack the six-yard area as a glorious opportunity to double their lead goes begging.
29',action,"Just as it looked like Swansea were making their way into this clash, Bournemouth strike a goal which has shifted momentum back with the visitors as they look to command possession in this match."
27',action,"Fantastic footwork from Wilshere on the edge of the box must be highlighted for the Bournemouth goal, but the hosts find themselves in a familiar position yet again as they go one behind."
25',goal,Goal Benik Afobe. GOAL! Afobe is gifted a goal as a clearance from Jordi Amat is cannoned off Fabianski into the striker's path who stabs home the first of the match.
25',action,Swansea are starting to look a bit more confident now as they come into this match. They're starting to get more time on the ball and it looks as if Fer has dropped into a deeper role which has liberated Sigurdsson a bit more.
23',action,"Dyer and Naughton again looking dangerous, with the latter of the duo whipping another cross into the box which is met by Llorente, but the Spaniard is unable to direct his header on target as it just goes wide of the post."
21',action,"Dyer and Naughton combine well to allow the full-back to drill a cross into the box, but nobody in a Swansea shirt expected the quality of the cross and both Fer and Llorente just watch the ball whistle across the six-yard area."
19',action,"SAVE! Fabianski is called into action as Fer presses forward and leaves space behind the midfield, allowing Stanislas a bit of room on the edge of the box but the winger's effort is tipped over the crossbar by the goalkeeper."
17',action,"Bournemouth are commanding the possession stats with a 61% share so far as they calmly knock the ball around the pitch, but the movement up top isn't quite there for them to craft any significant chances."

13',action,"A free-kick for Bournemouth in a dangerous position as Naughton clips Afobe and brings the striker down, but Fraser's deep cross into the box is headed away by Ki to relieve pressure for the time being."
11',action,Swansea look a little nervous when defending in the opening exchanges. Bournemouth are looking much more comfortable on the ball and as the visitors pass the ball around the home side's box them seem to be panicking.
9',action,"First corner of the match goes the way of the Cherries as Francis gets forward and drills a low cross into the Swansea box, but Britton does well to get back and clear the ball behind for a set-piece which is swept away from danger."
7',action,"A half-chance broke to Llorente on the edge of the box but the Spaniard opted against shooting first time and his touch was poor, bringing the attack to a close."
5',action,"Bournemouth are looking to use the pitch as much as they possibly can when they push forward, it's clear Howe has instructed Daniels and Francis to assist with attacks for the visitors."
3',action,Swansea are looking to push men forward in the early stages of this match and the combined pace of Dyer and Naughton has displayed early signs of danger for the hosts.
1',yellow-card,Yellow Card Sung-Yeung Ki. A terribly timed challenge from Ki on Fraser gets the South Korean a booking early on.
1',action,Bournemouth get the match underway!
,action,"Just five minutes until kick-off! The fans are in their seats, the atmosphere is building and the players are in the tunnel. Not long now."
,action,"As to be expected, Swansea head into this match with a host of changes from their 4-1 defeat at West Ham last time out, with just Fabianski, Mawson, Britton and Sigurdsson making the cut. However, Bournemouth also opt for a number of changes, four to be precise, with Afobe getting the nod to lead the line."
