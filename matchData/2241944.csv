,action,"Liverpool hold on to a vital win to keep themselves six points adrift of Chelsea, while City's challenge is fading fast as they are left 10 points adrift. There's much work ahead for Guardiola in 2017, but for Liverpool things look good as we head into the New Year."
90'+6',action,FULL-TIME!
90'+5',action,Things are being held up slightly after a flare found its way into the City area.
90'+3',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Nicolás Hernán Otamendi. Excellent from Origi, as he chases a hopeful ball up the flank, wrestles it away from Otamendi and then forces him into a foule, which brings the Argentinian a booking."
90'+1',action,There will be four minutes added on here.
89',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Sadio Mané sub-in Lucas Pezzini-Leiva . And a second switch for Liverpool now, with Lucas replacing Africa Cup of Nations-bound Mane."
89',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Gnégnéri Yaya Touré sub-in Kelechi Promise Iheanacho . Time's up for Toure, as he is replaced by Iheanacho."
88',action,"City continue to chuck men forward and Silva is adamant he was fouled as he is nudged over on the edge of the area by Lallana, but the England international was simply stronger."
86',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Pablo Javier Zabaleta Girod sub-in Jesús Navas González . First switch for City now and it's an attacking one, as Navas replaces Zabaleta."
84',action,"The corner does little, but it is cleared out for a throw-in and Liverpool take their time with it, so it's at least momentary respite for the hosts."
82',action,Milner wins a free-kick out wide and clips it into the box from the left and he wins a corner.
80',action,"Back come City again. Silva clips a clever pass into the right side of the area for De Bruyne, who sees his delivery deflected and palmed around the post by Mignolet."
78',action,"The corner causes Liverpool little bother and they almost seize the opportunity for a break, but Toure's long leg just about steals the ball from Wijnaldum in time."
77',action,"Sterling tries his luck on the opposite flank this time and his cross is contested by Silva. The ball then comes to Toure and City work it back to the left, where they win a corner."
75',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Emre Can. Out comes the yellow card, as Can is guilty of a pretty wild and late lunch on Sterling."
73',action,"Origi has been effective since coming on, holding the play up well and bringing team-mates into proceedings. He does so again, as Firmino finds him in a central position. The move peters out as the Brazilian sees another pass go astray."
71',action,"The Liverpool pressure is short-lived, though, as Lallana concedes a foul on Sterling."
70',action,"Good play by Origi, as he chases a pass and then runs at Stones, forcing a corner as his delivery is knocked behind."
68',action,"Good play by Sterling, as he keeps the ball in play out wide to cut back on Milner. He then darts past the left-back and attempts to get a cross in, but his counterpart gets back well and blocks it back against the winger to win a goal-kick."
66',action,"Liverpool deal with the free-kick well and break with intensity. Mane drives through the middle and plays Firmino in down the left. He tries to out-trick Kolarov and looks to be fouled, but City comes away unscathed."
65',action,"Not great defending from Lallana, as he is lured into a foul by Aguero out towards Liverpool's left."
64',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Jordan Henderson sub-in Divock Okoth Origi . And there's the change. Henderson makes way and is replaced by Origi, which will likely mean Lallana drops down into midfield."
63',action,We have a bit of a pause now as Henderson received medical attention. He is hobbling a bit and looks as though he may have to be replaced.
62',action,"Poor form Wijnaldum. Sterling manages to get a low cross into the area and the Dutchman intercepts, but he pokes a clearance straight at De Bruyne. Wijnaldum makes a crucial block to keep the Belgian's eventual shot at bay, though."
60',action,"The corner is played to the edge of the box for Kolarov and his volley is deflected towards goal, but it is an easy save for Mignolet."
59',action,"City have grown into this in the last ten minutes or so. Sterling is involved again, as his delivery is deflected behind for a corner."
58',action,"Good ball from Toure, as the Ivorian spots the run of Sterling in behind Milner with a lofted pass from deep, but the winger can only send his volley on the stretch into the side-netting."
56',action,"Close! Silva has been quiet so far, but he explodes into life now, as he breezes past a couple of men and sends a rasping left-footed drive just wide of the bottom-left corner."
54',action,"A rare sight of goal for Aguero, as he receives Silva's pass and makes space for himself before shooting from 25 yards. It's a straightforward stop for Mignolet, though."
52',action,"Stones does well in the corner, as he robs Firmino and then keeps possession. But eventually he clears and it smashes against Sterling before going out for a throw-in."
50',action,"Liverpool have started the second half much like they ended the first; on top. Mane and Clyne link up well on the right, but they are forced to go back on themselves and start again."
49',action,"Lallana and Zabaleta having words now, as the two clash out wide. The Englishman takes offence to his counterpart putting his arm around him and it all gets a bit tetchy."
48',action,"City are straight on to the front foot, but they give the ball away through Fernandinho and Liverpool break. Lallana and Firmino link well, with the Brazilian crossing into the danger zone after being released into the left side of the box. Clyne pounces, but his eventual effort is sliced horribly wide."
46',action,Off we go for the second half. Let's hope things are a little more enthralling than before the break.
,action,"Liverpool take a slender lead into the break after a first half which, quite simply, failed to live up to the expectations many would have held beforehand. It's been scrappy, bogged down in midfield and generally controlled by Liverpool. Guardiola has work to do."
45'+2',action,HALF-TIME!
45'+1',action,There will be one minute added on.
45',action,"A huge opportunity wasted by Liverpool! Toure is robbed by Firmino in front of his defence and the Brazilian prods the ball forward for Lallana as he looks set to race clear, but the England international went too early and is caught offside. City escape."
43',action,"The Belgian's corner is decent and it is delivered with some pace, but it is missed by everyone."
42',action,"Better from City. Firmino's poor pass is intercepted and De Bruyne charges forward, as he darts into the final third, breezes past Henderson and then sees a left-footed shot deflected behind for a corner."
40',action,"A wasted chance for City, as Silva produces a well-weighted lofted pass to Kolarov in the left side of the area, but his left-footed volley is drilled across the penalty area and out for a throw. Whether that was a cross or shot is unclear, but either way it was poor."
38',action,"Sterling has gone quiet since the early exchanges, but he gets back on the ball now and manages to make space after jolting past Milner. Nevertheless, the left-back gets a touch on it and Mignolet jumps up to pluck the ball from the sky."
36',action,"Liverpool press from the front now, as Can, Firmino and Lallana chase Zabaleta and Stones, but City actual deal with the situation quite well."
34',action,Kolarov is forced into a tricky situation with Mane lurking and he opts to simply put the ball out for a throw-in. Liverpool's pressing has been very good so far.
32',action,"Well, that was risky! Mignolet takes a touch with Aguero approaching, but he flicks the ball over the Argentinian in nonchalant fashion, before then scooping the ball over De Bruyne for Milner."
31',action,Not far away! Stones' headed clearance is cut out and Lallana is swiftly charging forward. He looks to Can to his left and the German curls a good effort just wide of the top-right corner.
29',action,"What a pass from Milner, as he intercepts near the halfway line, takes a touch and clips a half-volleyed delivery over Stones for Firmino, but his touch is a little heavy and Bravo gratefully comes out to gather."
28',action,It must be said that City have been underwhelming so far. Silva and De Bruyne have been anonymous so far.
27',action,"Another good attack from Liverpool, as Mane slides the ball in towards the middle of the pitch for Wijnaldum. He races on to it and shoots left-footed from 25 yards, slicing high and wide."
25',action,"The free-kick is launched into the box by Henderson and Lovren heads it goalwards. It should be an easy collect for Bravo, but he mistimes his jump and gets an unconvincing punch to it. They escape unscathed, though."
24',action,"Fernandinho lucky to avoid a booking now, as he catches Lallana very late. Nevertheless, it's a Liverpool free-kick now, about 35 yards out towards the left flank."
23',action,"Brilliant little duel in the corner, as Firmino and Sterling tussle with each other and eventually the Brazilian produces an outrageous flick which goes through his counterpart's legs. But Zabaleta quickly comes across and nudges him over and takes the ball."
22',action,The Kop enjoyed that! Sterling lined up a shot from just outside the area and his effort is blazed well over and into the stands. Cue ironic cheers.
20',action,"Liverpool are playing the much better football here. Wijnaldum does well to rob Toure in the middle before finding Milner to the left. The full-back runs at Zabaleta and squeezes a good cross into the centre, but Kolarov heads clear."
18',action,"Good play by the home side. Clyne and Firmino link up and the right-back finds Mane to the right of the box. He cleverly flicks the ball inside Otamendi and beats him, but Stones covers well and concedes a corner. It doesn't come to much, though."
16',action,"Poor from Otamendi, as the defender looks for a cross-field pass to the right for Sterling, but his effort goes out for a goal-kick."
14',action,"City are starting to see more prolonged periods in charge of the ball, but so far Liverpool have stood up to them well, with Wijnaldum and company in the middle particularly busy."
12',action,"Lovely play by Aguero, as he seizes on a poor pass and darts forward, jinking past Klavan and then going for goal with the outside of his right foot. Fortunately for the hosts, it goes well wide."
10',action,"Guardiola will not be impressed with City's defending for that goal, with Kolarov looking slow and cumbersome. He will be demanding a swift response."
8',goal,"Goal Georginio Wijnaldum. GOAL!!! LIVERPOOL HAVE THE LEAD! Excellent from the hosts, as Lallana delivers a sublime ball from the left at the end of a fine team move and Wijnaldum rises highest, sending a towering header into the left side of the net."
8',assist,"Assist Adam Lallana. Brilliant yet again from Lallana, as he crosses from the left and finds the run of Wijnaldum."
7',yellow-card,Yellow Card Ragnar Klavan. Poor again from Liverpool. This time Milner hangs Klavan out to dry with an awful pass and the Estonian has no option but to cynically flatten Aguero after he got to the ball first. The yellow card is swiftly brandished.
6',action,"Far too casual at the back from Liverpool. Mignolet makes an uncomfortable clearance to Lovren on the right, and then his attempted pass to Clyne is sliced out of play."
5',action,"Almost a good ball from deep by Henderson as he looks for the run of Firmino, but it just sneaks out of play before the Brazilian can reach it."
4',action,"Sterling is seeing a lot of the ball during these early exchanges. This time he quickly finds himself surrounded by three players, but he still wriggles away and keeps City on the ball."
2',action,"Kolarov's free-kick crashes into the wall and squirms through, but Milner hacks it clear."
1',action,"Bright start from Sterling, clearly not bothered by the chorus of jeers aimed in his direction. He brings the ball down on his chest well and gets beyond Milner, who brings him down 25 yards from goal. This is a good position."
1',action,Off we go! City get us started.
,action,Kick-off is just a few minutes away as the players begin to make their way out. What a fixture for the final match of 2016 - but which will be the happiest as we ring in the New Year? Or will Chelsea be the biggest gainers from this?
,action,"The return of Aguero from his four-match ban will undoubtedly be a boost to coach Pep Guardiola, with the Argentinian scoring 10 goals in 12 appearances in the league this season. But he's never had it easy at Anfield. In fact, he's yet to score in seven trips to the stadium."
,action,"Of course Chelsea's 4-2 defeat of Stoke City earlier has put these two sides under even more pressure, with Conte's men nine points clear of Liverpool and 10 ahead of City. A draw won't be much use for either side, but obviously a defeat would be even worse. Which side will be able to handle the pressure better?"
,action,"On the other side, Pep Guardiola makes three alterations from their 3-0 defeat of Hull City. At the back, both Gael Clichy and Bacary Sagna drop to the bench for Pablo Zabaleta and Aleksandar Kolarov, while Sergio Aguero comes in for Nolito further forward. Yaya Toure will look to continue his renaissance alongside Fernandinho in midfield."
,action,"Jurgen Klopp has opted for just the one change from the side which beat Stoke on Tuesday, with Emre Can coming into the midfield in place of Divock Origi, who drops to the bench. Other than that, there are few surprises, with Adam Lallana, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane making a rather fluid front three."
,action,"Man City subs: Caballero, Clichy, Sagna, Fernando, Garcia, Iheanacho, Navas."
,action,"Manchester City starting XI (4-2-3-1): Bravo; Zabaleta, Stones, Otamendi, Kolarov; Fernandinho, Yaya Toure; Sterling, Silva, De Bruyne; Aguero."
,action,"Liverpool subs: Karius, Moreno, Lucas, Alexander-Arnold, Ejaria, Origi, Sturridge"
,action,"Liverpool starting XI (4-3-3): Mignolet; Clyne, Lovren, Klavan, Milner; Henderson, Wijnaldum, Can; Lallana, Mane, Firmino."
,action,"Hello and welcome to the LIVE coverage of this Premier League encounter between Liverpool and Manchester City. I will be describing the action for you today, as these two sides go head-to-head at Anfield looking to close the gap on Chelsea, who are now nine points clear of the second-placed Reds."
