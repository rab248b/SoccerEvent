,action,"That's all from us today folks, enjoy the rest of your day."
,action,"Stoke secure all three points at the Bet365 Stadium with a 3-1 victory, thanks to goal from Marko Arnautovic, Peter Crouch and Xherdan Shaqiri. It was a tight game, with Hull having plenty of chances but they only managed one, with Harry Maguire scoring. However this defeat will hurt the Tigers, who remain in the midst of a relegation battle."
,action,FULL-TIME: STOKE 3-1 HULL
90'+4',action,That's the final whistle!
90'+2',action,"Pieters plays a good one-two with Walters on the edge of the box and then fires a low shot at goal, but it is well blocked by Hull skipper Michael Dawson. The resulting corner is cleared well by the Tigers."
90',action,"Stoke look to have ended their run of defeats, a fifth defeat here today would have been their fifth in a row. However with four minutes of added time played, it looks clear that the Potters have wrapped up all three points here today."
88',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Xherdan Shaqiri sub-in Mame Biram Diouf . Stoke now make their final substitution of the game, with the scorer of the third Potters goal sub-out Xherdan Shaqiri the man heading off the pitch, he is replaced by sub-in Mame Biram Diouf."
86',substitution,Substitution sub-out Lazar Marković sub-in Ahmed Eissa El Mohamady Abdel Fattah . The third and final Tigers substitution sees sub-out Lazar Marković replaced by Ahmed Elmohamady.
86',substitution,"Substitution sub-out El-Hadji Baye Oumar Niasse sub-in Dieumerci Mbokani Bezua . Hull make a double substitution, with Oumar Niasse the man coming off who is replaced by Dieumerci Mbokani."
84',action,Long stoppage in play here as Ranocchia is down receiving treatment for a head injury. The Tigers player are furious that play was not stopped for the injury.
80',assist,Assist Marko Arnautović. A goal and an assist for Marko Arnautović here today. However it is pure magic from Shaqiri!
80',goal,"Goal Xherdan Shaqiri. WHAT A GOAL! Xherdan Shaqiri with a phenomenal strike to give Stoke a 3-1 lead. The Potters broke fast, the ball was then played to Shaqiri who took a touch, cut inside and unleashed an unstoppable strike at goal. The dipping strike flew straight into the top corner, giving Jakupovic no chance."
79',action,"STOKE HIT THE CROSSBAR! Walters almost makes it 3-1 to Stoke and a goal which surely would have sealed all three points for the Potters. Arnautovic gets to the byline, cuts it back for Walters who tries to place it into the back of the net, however his effort smashes against the bar."
78',action,"Hull keep pushing for another goal here. The Tigers have responded well to going a goal down, but time is not on their side now and they need to start taking their chances."
76',action,"HUGE HULL CHANCE! Grosicki does brilliantly down the left flank, beats Johnson with his pace and skill and fires a low shot at goal. His effort forces Grant into making a great save to deny the Polish international, the rebound then falls to Niasse who shoots at goal but his effort is blocked by Martins Indi and out for a corner. The resulting corner comes to nothing."
75',action,"Decent opportunity for Stoke. Arnautovic outpaced Ranocchia down the right flank, he then put a good ball into the box looking for Walters but the ball who slightly too far in front of his team mate and the chance goes away."
73',action,"The Tigers may now look to play the ball over the top of the Stoke defence, using the pace of Hernandez to cause them problems. However Huddlestone's departure means they are now missing their main play maker in the middle of the pitch, who links the defence to attack."
70',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Tom Huddlestone sub-in Abel Mathías Hernández Platero . Here is the first Hull substitution and it is an attacking one, sub-out Tom Huddlestone comes off to be replaced by striker Abel Hernández."
70',yellow-card,Yellow Card Lazar Marković. Marković goes into the book after appealing a decision by the referee. The winger needs to keep his cool now.
69',action,"That Stoke goal will be a bitter blow for the Tigers, who had been playing well before the Potters goal. Marco Silva may need to make a couple of changes in order to turn this game around."
66',assist,Assist Jonathan Walters. What an impact Crouch and Walters have had on this game for Stoke. It was an inch-perfect cross by Walters into the path of Crouch who was never going to miss from the six-yard box.
66',goal,"Goal Peter Crouch. GOOOAAALLL! STOKE TAKE THE LEAD! Jon Walters does brilliantly to bring the ball down on the left wing, he then looks up and whips a great ball into the box. Peter Crouch then rises well above his marker and heads the ball straight into the bottom corner."
65',action,"The home supporters are growing more and more anxious as the minutes pass by. Their side are struggling to create any goal scoring opportunities, whilst the Tigers keep pushing forward in search of what would be a huge second goal."
62',action,"ANOTHER HULL CHANCE! A defensive mistake by Grant and Pieters allows Niasse another good opportunity to score. Pieters fails to deal with the long ball, it then falls to Niasse on the edge of the box who tries to lob the ball over Grant who had rushed out of goal. However the striker once again fails to hit the target."
61',action,"The game is starting to become more and more stretched, with both teams in search of a potentially winning goal. Stoke have been boosted by their recent substitutes, but the Tigers still look dangerous going forward."
59',action,"GREAT SAVE! Jakupovic pulls off a brilliant save to deny Jonathon Walters a goal after a diving header, that looked to be heading into the bottom corner. However the Tigers keeper gets down quickly to make a fingertip save. Peter Crouch then has a good chance with the rebound but he mistimes his effort and it goes well wide."
58',substitution,Substitution sub-out Saido Berahino sub-in Peter Crouch . The other Potters substitution sees sub-out Saido Berahino be replaced by sub-in Peter Crouch up front.
58',substitution,Substitution sub-out Charlie Adam sub-in Jonathan Walters . The first of a double substitution for Stoke as they look to gain a foothold in this game once again. sub-out Charlie Adam makes way for sub-in Jonathan Walters.
56',action,"Stoke have a free-kick in a good shooting position, around 25 yards from goal. Adam dribbled past a couple of players before being tripped up by Huddlestone. Shaqiri takes the set piece, but his effort goes high and wide over the bar."
55',action,"It is now the Hull supporters who are now making all of noise here at the Bet365 Stadium, with Marco Silva's name being shouted from the stands. If the Tigers could go on to win this game, it would be massive in their bid to avoid relegation."
53',action,"That Hull equaliser may give the Potters the kick they needed to start pushing forward and playing good football once again. The hosts dominated the first 15-20 minutes of the game, but since then the Tigers have looked the more likely side to score and have created the better chances."
51',goal,"Goal Harry Maguire. GOOOAAALLL! HULL EQUALISE! Maguire has levelled the scoreline for the Tigers and deservedly so. Hull took a short corner, the ball came in and Stoke failed to clear the lines. The ball then fell perfectly so the centre-back, under no pressure at the far post and he smashes the ball into the back of the net."
51',assist,Assist Andrea Ranocchia. Assist Andrea Ranocchia
49',action,"Huddlestone puts a good ball into the box which is met by Niasse, but the striker elects to try and head the ball towards goal rather than control the ball with his chest. Stoke clear the danger."
48',action,"Surely we will see at least one more goal in this game. Hull have started the second half on top, just as they ended the first period. The Tigers are dominating possession in the middle of the pitch with Huddlestone orchestrating the midfield for the visitors."
46',action,The second half is underway!
,action,"Stoke started the game well and took the lead on six minutes through Marko Arnautovic. It then looked like the Potters would go on to score more after having several chances. However the Tigers have grown into the game, with good chances falling to Niasse, Markovic and Maguire."
,action,HALF-TIME: STOKE 1-0 HULL
45'+2',action,That's the half-time whistle!

45',yellow-card,Yellow Card El-Hadji Baye Oumar Niasse. Niasse is the first player to receive a yellow card for a late challenge on Lee Grant as he gathered a cross.
44',action,"It's all Hull now! However they are lacking the final ball. Robertson and Grosicki are linking up very well down the left flank, but their crosses are poor. Maguire then picks up the ball and fires a shot at goal but it is well blocked."
42',action,"Not long to go until the half-time whistle now here at the Bet365 Stadium. The Tigers look the better team at the moment, pressing for an equalising goal but they are not taking their chances. Grosicki has the opportunity to take a shot at goal, but instead he tries to pass it square to Niasse who was crowed out by Ryan Shawcross and Martins Indi."
39',action,"Good football from Hull. Grosicki takes a quick throw-in, playing the ball to Robertson who lays it off to Markovic. The man on-loan from Liverpool elects to shoot himself but his effort is deflected. The better option was to pass to Clucas to his right, who was in a lot of space and a better position."
38',action,"The Tigers will still be confident of coming away from this game with some points, they have earned an unrivalled nine points from losing positions since Silva's appointment on 5 January."
35',action,"Arnautovic times his deep run to perfection, to beat the offside flag. Charlie Adam played a good ball over the Hull back three into his path. Arnautovic then cuts inside and tries to pick out Berahino but Ranocchia is quick to see the danger and comes away with the ball."
33',action,"STOKE CHANCE! Johnson plays a perfect ball into the path of Arnautovic who fires a low shot at goal, it looks to be heading into the far corner but drifts narrowly wide. Berahino is furious with his teammate for not crossing the ball to him for a simple tap-in."
31',action,"Brief stoppage in play as Eric Pieters is down receiving medical treatment. The resulting corner from Markovic's header comes in and is cleared by Stoke, but the Tigers keep on pressing and they have another corner. This corner is met by Ranocchia and goes high over the crossbar."
29',action,"The Tigers are really knocking on the door now! Andy Robertson whips a very good ball into the box, which is met by Markovic but his diving header is deflected wide and goes out for a Tigers corner."
28',action,"ANOTHER HULL CHANCE! The Tigers have a corner which is lofted in by Grosicki and Stoke fail to clear the ball. The ball bounces around in the penalty area, before Maguire lashes a shot at goal, which goes high and wide of the Stoke goal."
26',action,HUGE CHANCE! Markovic forces Grant into making a superb save. The ball came deep into the box and the run from Niasse diverted the Stoke defenders attention. Markovic took the ball out of the air and fired a volley at goal which Grant had to be alert to. Best Hull chance of the game so far.
25',action,Stoke boss Mark Hughes does not appear pleased by his sides performance over the last ten minutes or so. The Potters were dominating this game and could have been leading by more goals. However they have eased off and this is allowing Hull to fight back and now it is the visitors who look the better team.
23',action,"The Tigers have certainly grown into the game, they are now pressing far higher up the pitch and starting to cause Stoke problems. However their final ball and quality is lacking at the moment."
21',action,"This is much better from the Tigers. Good link up play by Maguire and Lazar Markovic down the right, the latter whips a ball into the box with several of his teammates awaiting the ball, but Stoke clear. However the ball comes straight back into the box and Niasse meets another Markovic cross, but he doesn't get the required touch to turn it into the back of the net. It went just inches wide of the goal, with Lee Grant scrambling to get across."
19',action,"Oumar Niasse does brilliantly to run the ball out of danger area for Hull, he reaches the half-way line but then runs out of ideas, leading to Stoke gaining the ball back. Another Potters attack is mounted."
17',action,"It's all Stoke at the moment. Shaqiri with a good chance from the penalty spot, but several Hull players throw their body at the ball to block the shot and succeed in doing so. A second Stoke goal looks highly likely."
16',action,CHANCE BERAHINO! Another good opportunity for the Stoke striker and this time the flag stays down. However Maguire is able to get back in time to block his shot from the edge of the area and Hull eventually clear.
16',action,"STAT: Hull have won 17 points from 12 games since Marco Silva was appointed as head coach - the ninth best record in the league. However, only one point has been earned on the road as Hull have lost 13 of their last 14 away games."
14',action,"GOAL DISALLOWED! Saido Berahino wheels away in celebration, thinking he has scored his first Stoke City goal. However the linesman rightly rules the goal out for offside. The Potters striker had drifted slightly offside as he tried to outpace Maguire."
12',action,"Hull are struggling to gain any possession of the ball at the moment and the Potters look comfortable in midfield, plus they look dangerous every time they enter the Tigers final third."
10',action,"WHAT A CHANCE! Arnautovic almost doubles his tally, after linking up with Shakiri once again. The Swiss international chipped the ball over the Hull back line, straight into the path of Arnautovic who took the shot on the volley. However his effort has too much power behind it and goes high over the bar. Excellent opportuntity."
9',action,"For a team in the midst of a relegation battle, this is the worst possible start for the Tigers. Especially with their poor record away from home, so far it is all Stoke."
6',assist,"Assist Xherdan Shaqiri. So often the man scoring the goals, this time Shaqiri lays on an assist for his teammate who has given Stoke the lead with a superb strike."
6',goal,"Goal Marko Arnautović. GOOOAAALLL! STOKE TAKE THE LEAD! An excellent finish by Marko Arnautovic. The ball was fed to him by Xherdan Shakiri and the winger cut inside, beating Harry Maguire and Michael Dawson far too easily, before firing a fantastic curling shot at goal which left Eldin Jakupovic with no chance. Perfect start for the Potters."
5',action,"Much better play by the hosts. Glen Johnson puts a brilliant ball into the box, looking for Saido Berahino but Andrea Ranocchia makes a superb clearance and the balls goes out for a corner. The resulting corner comes to nothing."
4',action,"Head-to-head: Stoke have suffered just one defeat against Hull in 13 league meetings (W6, D6). The Tigers have failed to score in five of their last six encounters with Stoke. However, Hull won 2-1 at the Britannia Stadium earlier this season in the EFL Cup."
2',action,"Good start from the Tigers here at the Bet365 Stadium. Sam Clucas and Kamil Grosicki linking up well which ends up with a deflected shot at goal, but the linesman raises his flag for offside."
