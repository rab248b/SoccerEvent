,action,"Thanks for joining our commentary this evening. Until next time, goodbye."
,action,"It was a bizarre game, full of strange decisions and incidents, but Vincenzo Montella will not care about it too much now. Rolando Maran on the other hand will look back on Milan's second penalty decision and Fabrizio Cacciatore's shocking late miss with regret."
,action,"A brace from Carlos Bacca and a strike from the penalty spot from Gianluca Lapadula secure the win for AC Milan this evening, moving the club into fifth place in Serie A."
,action,FULL-TIME: AC MILAN 3-1 CHIEVO
90'+4',action,The referee ends the contest.
90'+3',action,"Gobbi is a lucky man to remain on the field as Chievo botch their free-kick as Birsa gets his delivery all wrong. Deulofeu breaks away and looks to be through on goal, only for the left-back to stick out his arm to stop the winger. It's a clear sending off, but the referee chooses to ignore the incident."
90'+2',yellow-card,Yellow Card Lucas Ariel Ocampos. Ocampos flies into a challenge with Cacciatore and gets a booking.
90',action,There will be three minutes of added time.

87',action,"CHANCE! Deulofeu should notch a fourth goal for his time as Lapadula lays the ball to him on a plate, but he curls his effort past the post."
86',action,"Deulofeu raids forward ass Milan search for a fourth goal, but Cesar gets back to make the block to stop his cross."
84',substitution,Substitution sub-out Jonathan de Guzmán sub-in Sofian Kiyine . Kiyine replaces De Guzman for the visitors.
84',action,"SHOCKING MISS! Cacciatore produces the miss of the season as he belts his effort off the bar from two yards out with the goal gaping. All he had to do was tap the ball into the net as Donnarumma was stranded following a corner, but the defender could not keep his composure. Incredible!"
82',penalty-goal,Penalty Goal Gianluca Lapadula. GOALLL!!! MILAN NOTCH THEIR THIRD! Lapadula puts the game beyond doubt as he hammers his effort into the bottom corner past Sorrentino. Chievo will feel hard done by with that decision from the referee.
81',action,"PENALTY TO MILAN! Oh dear the official has had a nightmare here. Ocampos kicks the boot of Izco and goes down, but the referee points to the spot."
79',substitution,Substitution sub-out Carlos Arturo Bacca Ahumada sub-in Juraj Kucka . Bacca is done for the evening with two goals to his name. It could so easily have been more had he had his shooting boots on. Kucka replaces him.
78',action,"CLOSE! From the resulting corner, the ball from Birsa skims off the head of a Rossoneri player and drifts inches past the post and out for another set-piece. This contest has been intriguing to say the least."
77',action,"SAVE! Izco slides the ball to Birsa in the final third and he escapes Zapata's challenge to fire at goal, but Donnarumma flings himself to his left to palm the ball past the post."
75',action,"CHANCE! Bacca again fails to convert. This time it's a hard chance as he has to drag Lapadula's header from behind him and he cannot make contact with the ball leaning back, allowing Sorrentino to gather on the line."
73',action,Milan cannot afford any slip-ups like they did in the first half. Montella will be hopeful that his team can kill off the contest now.
71',action,"CHANCE! Bacca has the opportunity to complete his hat-trick as he latches on to a ball over the top and escapes the attention of Cesar, only to hammer his effort over the bar. The Colombian could have had five goals this evening had he been at his best."
70',assist,"Assist Alessio Romagnoli. Romagnoli rises highest at the near post to attack the ball and head it towards Bacca, who converts in the six-yard box."
70',goal,"Goal Carlos Arturo Bacca Ahumada. GOALLLLL!!! BACCA FIRES MILAN AHEAD AGAIN! The Colombian's bizarre evening takes another turn as he bundles the ball home from close range, displaying his predatory instincts after latching on to Romagnoli's flick-on from a corner."
69',action,"Deulofeu makes a menancing run down the right, but a solid covering tackle from Cesar sends the ball behind for a corner."
66',action,"BLOCK! Lapadula collects from Deulofeu on the left and takes a touch before firing at goal with his left foot. However, the looming figure of Dainelli makes a vital block to keep his effort at bay."
65',action,"The home side win a corner down the right flank, but the visitors clear the initial cross. Vangioni goes for the strike as he collects the loose ball 25 yards from goal, only to hammer his effort into the stand behind the goal."

61',substitution,Substitution sub-out Manuel Locatelli sub-in Gianluca Lapadula . Lapadula replaces Locatelli for the home side.
61',action,"Birsa has space in the Milan half as the home side back off the Chievo midfielder. However, he fails to provide a meaningful effort at goal or a quality cross into the box. He seemed to be caught in two minds."
60',action,"Bertolacci swings a cross in from the right and Romagnoli rises highest in the box to head his corner at goal, but Sorrentino is able to gather the tame effort with ease."
58',action,"CHANCE! Bacca collects on the edge of the box and beats three Chievo defenders to open up space for a strike. He goes for the shot with the outside of his right boot, but can only send the ball over the bar. He's having a strange evening the Colombian."
56',action,"WIDE! Milan win a corner down the left flank and Deulofeu swings the ball towards the near post where Ocampos attacks the ball. However, his headed effort drifts wide of the far post."
54',substitution,Substitution sub-out Riccardo Meggiorini sub-in Roberto Inglese . Inglese replaces Meggiorini for the visitors.
53',action,"CHANCE! De Guzman sends a deep cross to the back post and Meggiorini on the stretch manages to send it across the face of goal. However, Cesar does not expect his team-mate to win the ball and allows Donnarumma to beat him to gain posssession."
52',action,"OFFSIDE! Sosa sends the ball to the near post for Bacca's run, but the forward lifts his strike over the bar from close range. Bacca will be relieved to see the offside flag go up as it would have been another poor miss from the Colombian."
50',action,"The referee has been extremely active this evening on his whistle. First he blows for a foul against Gakpe, but then from the resulting free-kick for the visitors he awards a set-piece in turn for the home side."
49',action,"CHANCE! Birsa sends a ball over the top for Gakpe's run and the Frenchman takes it in stride into the box. He goes for goal with a right-footed strike, but can only blast his effort well wide of the target."
46',action,We're back underway at the San Siro.
,action,"Bacca had the opportunity to fire his side in front again as the referee was once again in the action, awarding his second penalty of the game. However, the Colombian lost his nerve and blasted his strike over the bar."
,action,"It's level at the break between AC Milan and Chievo. It's been a strange half to say the least as the visitors were on top in the early stages, but fell behind to Carlos Bacca's opener in the 23rd minute. However, Rolando Maran's men were awarded a controversial penalty when Mattia De Sciglio was adjudged to have fouled Serge Gakpe and Jonathan de Guzman converted from the spot."

45'+3',action,The referee ends the first half.

42',penalty-goal,"Penalty Goal Jonathan de Guzmán. GOALLLL!!!! CHIEVO EQUALISE!

37',action,"OFF THE LINE! Gobbi loses possession to Deulofeu who breaks to the edge of the box. He slides the ball to Bacca to fire at goal, but he cannot beat Sorrentino cleanly, although then ball still trickles towards the line. Radovanovic is on hand to clear the danger just in time to save his team."
36',action,"WIDE! Deulofeu raids with menace into the final third, but opts to pass back to Sosa on the edge to strike rather than sending a cross to the back post. His team-mates blasts the ball wide of the target with his strike, wasting the opening."
35',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Jesús Joaquín Fernández Sáez de la Torre sub-in Lucas Ariel Ocampos . Ocampos replaces Suso, who appears to be struggling with an injury."
33',yellow-card,Yellow Card Gerard Deulofeu Lázaro. Deulofeu goes into the book for protesting too much to the official for the spot-kick.
32',action,"Deulofeu makes a weaving run into the box before he goes down under pressure from Dainelli. He wants a penalty, but the referee dismisses his appeal."
29',action,"WIDE! Locatelli latches on to Bertolacci's lay-off on the edge of the box and attempts to place his strike into the corner, only to send his effort inches past the post. Sorrentino was at full stretch and it didn't look like he was getting there."
28',action,"Maran will be furious with his team as they've dominated the contest thus far, but have not been ciinical in the final third, while they were cut open far too easily for Bacca's goal."
26',action,"CHANCE! Chievo spurn a glorious opening to respond as Gakpe raids down the right and sends a low cross into the middle, but Birsa fails to connect at the vital moment."
24',goal,"Goal Carlos Arturo Bacca Ahumada. GOALLLLL!!!! BACCA PUTS MILAN AHEAD! The home side take the lead completely against the run of play. Deulofeu releases Bacca down the left channel and he is allowed to cut back on his right foot before burying his effort past Sorrentino. The keeper attempted to stop the ball with his leg, but was unsighted allowing the effort to trickle into the net."
24',assist,"Assist Gerard Deulofeu Lázaro. Deulofeu simply knocks the ball into the channel with an early pass, allowing the forward to do the rest."
23',action,There will be concerns for Montella on the sideline due to his side's start to the game. Chievo are well on top here and have looked dangerous in the final third.
21',action,"CHANCE! The visitors are on top here and threaten once more as Milan again are lapse at the back. Meggiorini seizes on a loose ball and hammers a left-footed half-volley at goal, sending his strike narrowly past the post. Donnarumma was very concerned with that effort."
20',action,"SAVE! Milan are not closing down the Chievo midfielders fast enough and that allows Birsa to fire at goal from distance. His effort has power and the direction to threaten the back of the net, but Donnarumma is there to make a smart stop low to his left."

15',action,"CHANCE! Gobbi tees up Gakpe in the final third and the Frenchman takes a touch to get the ball on his right foot before firing at goal. However, he pulls his strike wide of the target."

12',action,"Castro sends the ball into the box, but Donnarumma meets the ball with his fists to clear the danger away from the six-yard box."
11',action,Cacciatore runs forward from the back yet again and Deulofeu is forced to act to turn the ball behind for a corner.
10',action,"Cacciatore is demanding a corner from the official behind the goal, but his protests are in vain. The full-back gets a talking to from the referee following his outburst."
8',action,"Chievo are putting the press on the home side in possession at the back, which is making life hard for them to push out of their own half."
6',action,Milan are just trying to build a rhythm in their play in the early stages of the contest. Montella's men have not had the quickest of starts with their attacking play.
