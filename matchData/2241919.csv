,action,"Eddie Howe will be disappointed having watched his side lose just their third home game this season and the game being a derby will only add to that pain. Bournemouth started the game well and were 1-0 up in the opening ten minutes but after a fast paced and high tempo opening 45-minutes, the Cherries tired and couldn't keep up with the game whilst Southampton overcame their struggles."
,action,Southampton run out 3-1 winners at Bournemouth after coming back from a goal down. A disappointing showing from the hosts who normally fare better at home. A change in fortunes for Southampton who have been poor in front of goal of late but Puel will have no complaints today and huge credit needs to go to Rodriguez. The forward has had a huge spell on the sidelines with injury and has been forced to watch his team play but his hard work and patience has paid dividends today.
90'+4',action,"Last Christmas I gave you my heart and the very next day you gave it away, this year to save me from tears, I'll give it to Jay Rodriguez sing the Saints fans and can you blame them? It was a hell of a second-half showing from the forward who should now have his confidence back. The derby hero won the game for his side."
90'+3',substitution,Substitution sub-out Jay Rodriguez sub-in Shane Long . Goal hero sub-out Jay Rodriguez leaves the field to a rapturous applause from the visiting support as he makes way for sub-in Shane Long.
90'+1',action,That stoppage in play has led an additional five minutes in time. Van Djik goes close to making it 4-1 but Boruc makes the save. Cedric and Hojbjerg both go down but are soon back to their feet as Bournemoith show they aren't giving up just yet.
88',action,There's a stop in play as Cedric receives treatment. The Saints man is back to his feet and can concentrate on helping his side see the game out. What a derby debut for Puel.
85',assist,"Assist Nathan Redmond. I'm not sure just how much Nathan Redmond knew about the assist as the ball seemed to just roll up his body and onto his face but they all count, right?"
85',goal,"Goal Jay Rodriguez. WHAT GOAL DROUGHT!? What a way to round off a derby from Jay Rodriguez. The ball rolls up Redmond, the forward turns and volleys it into the net from 20-yards and leaves Boruc with no chance. An excellent goal."
83',action,Bournemouth are putting the ball in the box a lot more now and have another corner but van Djik is there to clear. They're definitely on the search for a leveller but has it come just too late? Southampton take their turn to attack before Ibe wins the ball back.
81',action,So close from Bertrand! His shot from 20-yards is always dipping but just not enough to sail past Boruc. Bournemouth take it down the other end and win a corner but it's another one wasted as Forster catches with ease. Howe will be one frustrated man.
80',action,"Bournemouth play it in front of Southampton as the visitors momentarily hold off and then win the ball back. Redmon looks to race down the wing with it but Francis prevents the run and the Saints have a throw. Ten minutes remaining here, can Southampton hold on or will Bournemouth find a way back?"
78',yellow-card,Yellow Card Steven Davis. Steven Davis goes into the book this time for bringing down Smith.
77',action,"Bournemouth win another freekick in similar position and this time take it long and whilst it's more successful than previous attempts in terms of troubling Southampton, ultimately it still fails. Bournemouth have been far too wasteful in that department."
76',yellow-card,Yellow Card Jordy Clasie. Jordy Clasie is booked for fouling Wilshere.
74',action,"Bournemouth win a freekick in a promising central position after Hojbjerg hacks down Wilshere. The set-piece is taken short and again, that tactic fails for the Cherries. Whatever the plan is there, is anybody's guess."
72',substitution,Substitution sub-out Joshua King sub-in Jordon Ibe . sub-out Joshua King is brought off in favour sub-in Jordon Ibe and this is the £15million man's chance to make his stamp.
72',action,Bournemouth fans shout for a half-hearted penalty appeal after judging Bertrand to have hand-balled it put Clattenburg points to his leg and there's few complaints from the hosts. Bournemouth are running out of time in this clash and look tired.
70',action,Southampton still have the edge as we enter the last 20 minutes of the game here at the Vitality Stadium. It's Puel's first taste of an English derby and he'll be happy with his side's second-half showing thus far. Despite Howe's positive substitutions his men just can't find a route back into the game.
67',action,CLOSE! Ake is the man again for Bournemouth as he clears another Southampton chance off his line! Hojbjerg was left completely unmarked at the back post and hit a volley goalward. A big let off for the Cherries.
65',action,Hojbjerg whips it in for Rodriguez and wins a corner with the resulting chance. The corner is straight into the hands of Boruc who looks to get it away quickly. Bournemouth are just ultimately failing to cause a threat at the moment and Southampton look much more convincing since going 2-1 up.
64',substitution,Substitution sub-out Callum Wilson sub-in Benik Afobe . sub-out Callum Wilson makes way for sub-in Benik Afobe as Howe searches for a way back into the game.
63',action,Steve Cook looks to utilise his long throw but who else other than van Djik is there to clear as he climbs above Francis. The away fans are making all the news here and the hosts could do with being lifted by their fans.
62',substitution,Substitution sub-out Sofiane Boufal sub-in Dušan Tadić . sub-out Sofiane Boufal is not pleased as he hauled off in place sub-in Dušan Tadić.
61',action,King looks to team up with Wilson but his ball bounces off his teammate. King then looks to whip it in for Wilson but a breakdown in communication proves fatal for the chance and the visitors have a goal kick.
59',action,The crowd are turning up the noise as we appraoch the hour mark. Clattenburg awards the hosts a freekick at the halfway line after Adam Smith is brought down but they are struggling in the attacking third and are lacking any real threat in that department. Unusual for the Cherries considering goals have been flowing for them at home this season.
57',action,Close from Rodriguez as he looks for his brace! Boruc was there to stop the danger before Ake cleared it off the line but Bournemouth need to wake up defensively and stop balls like that coming into the box before the Saints kill the game off.
55',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Marc Pugh sub-in Ryan Fraser . sub-out Marc Pugh makes way for sub-in Ryan Fraser. There's no secret about the threat Fraser can pose and some fresh legs may work wonders for the Cherries, only time will tell..."
55',action,"Bournemouth try to get forward again as they take a moment to pass the ball around at the halfway line. Jack Wilshere gives it to Francis who returns it Wilshre and Bournemouth aren't happy as Pugh is brought down as he looks to get on the end of Wilshere's ball. The hosts want a penalty but Clattenburg waves the appeals away, good judgement from the man in blue."
52',action,"Bournemouth deal with a Southampton corner well and begin an attack. Howe is up on his feet trying to rally his troops who are understandably deflated. The away fans are in fine voice and Wilson almost silences them! King races into the box and gives it to Wilson who frustratingly fires it well over. There was just too much power on it from Wilson but it's a promising sign for Howe, who's men are showing they won't lose without a fight."
51',action,That goal is a killer blow to Bournemouth who find themselves 2-1 down minutes after the second-half. Southampton won't want to let this lead slip and will now do everything in their power to make sure they're victorious in this derby. Howe's men certainly have their work cut out as Southampton look to take it forward and make things happen again.
48',assist,Assist Steven Davis. Steven Davis got the assist and what an assist it was.
48',goal,Goal Jay Rodriguez. GOAL! Jay Rodriguez puts the Saints ahead! That will do the striker's confidence the world of good. Davis linked up beautifully with Boufal before back-heeling it across the face of Boruc straight into the path of Rodriguez who made no mitsake in finishing the shot.
47',action,CLOSE! Southampton almost go in frotn immeadiately! Redmond unleashes a fierce low shot and Boruc has to get down low to keep it out. A huge wake up call for the Cherries.
46',substitution,Substitution sub-out Harrison Reed sub-in Steven Davis . sub-out Harrison Reed is replaced by sub-in Steven Davis at the break.
46',action,Bournemouth get us underway as we enter the second-half...
,action,"Southampton ended the first-half on top but only ever so slightly. The first 45 minutes has been a clear indication that many Saints players seem bereft of confidence as whilst chances have been there and there is no problem creating them, they have looked scared or held off when it comes to finishing them."
,action,"The two sides head into the break with the score at 1-1. Ake put Bournemouth ahead in the first six minutes before Bertrand put Southampton back in it. it's certainly been a lovely affair here at Bournemouth, and sometimes firey with Clasie angering a lot of the home support with numerous challenges."
45',action,One additional minute has been indicated here on the south coast. The game has quietened down since we've entered the dying stages of the first-half. Southampton pass the ball around and Bournemouth are happy to let them do so for the minute.
42',action,"Daniels keeps the ball in play for Bournemouth and Wilson looks to bring the ball down but the forward is unable to do so. Five minutes of the first-half remain, can either team find a way through? It's certainly been a lively affair thus far and that's everything you want in a derby."
39',action,"Boufal is on the run but he hits it on the outside of his boot and the ball goes straight to Pugh. The Saints win the ball back and take a minute to pass it around their own half before Redmond fires it into the box. Fortunately for the hosts Steve Cook is there to clear. Wilson goes it alone at the other end and manages to keep ahold of the ball till King arrives but after doing the hard work, he gives the ball away immeadiately."
36',action,"It's a clever ball from Hojbjerg who attempted to switch it Boufal, unfortunately it had slightly too much curve on and Boufal failed to control it. Bournemouth race down the other end, Pugh nips into the box and feeds it to Wilson who heads it straight into the hands of an alert Forster."
34',yellow-card,Yellow Card Sofiane Boufal. Boufal is put in the book for a dive on the edge of the box.
34',action,"A lot of no nonsense challenges flying around here at the minute. Clasie has got away with a number of challenges and the referee finally pulls Boufal up, though this time for a dive, and is met with a sarcastic applause from the home support."
32',action,Bournemouth appeal for hand ball as Yoshida seems to have handled it but the lineman isn't interested. Howe's men are beginning to cause problems for Southampton as the visitors struggle to deal with the ever changing tempo.
30',action,It looked promising for Bournemouth for a second as Wilshere looked to us his pace but the move is shortlived and Southampton make the attack. It's a hell of a miss kick from Redmond who misses a golden opportunity to put his side ahead. Redmon will kick himself when he sees that back.
28',action,"Wilshere takes the corner short and it's a tactic that Bournemouth keep trying and keep failing at as the ball ends up with Boruc and then a Southampton shirt. Boufal gets it forward for the visitors and if there's one person who looks like they're going to make something happen, it's him. The man is constantly trying to take it forward."
26',action,CLOSE! Redmond knocks the ball across the of the goal as James Rodriguez fails to nip in and take it away. A poor decision from the Saints forward who could have put Southampton in front. A clear indication of the lack of confidence from Puel's striking counterparts. Though what is promising for Southampton is that the game is a lot more open now and not so one-sided to Bournemouth.
24',action,Clasie goes in late on Harry Arter and bizarrely escapes without punishment from the referee. Yoshida is the man again for Southampton as he blocks Wilson for a second time. Forster takes the goal kick as Clattenburg continues his word with Clasie.
21',action,"The game looks to have calmed down now as we edge half-way into the first half. Southampton look to pass the ball around on their own half as Yoshida cannons it into the attacking third, though the ball lacked direction and Bournemouth win the ball back following a throw. Wilson takes advantage of Hojbjerg's mistake and goes into the box looking to let the ball run across his body but there's no time and Yoshida clears the danger."
18',action,"King and Wilson look to team up to put Bournemouth back in front. The ball is back with Smith who gives to Pugh who looks to volley it past Forster, fortunately for Puel, his man is there to greet it and Forster plucks the resulting corner out of the air. Southampton look more confident now they are back level."
16',action,"Tempers are getting frayed on the south coast as the home fans chant 'off, off, off' at Boufal. The Southampton man looked to have grabbed Callum Wilson's legs and the hosts are not happy. Clattenburg is having none of it and Boufal is unpunished."
14',goal,"Goal Ryan Bertrand. GOAL! Out of no-where Ryan Bertrand draws it level for Southampton! It was a great goal from Bertrand who tucked it away from a tight angle. Though questions have to be asked of Artur Boruc, the keeper was half a yard from his near post and should not be getting beat from that angle."
14',assist,Assist Jordy Clasie. Jordy Clasie marks his return to the starting eleven with an assist.
12',action,Agonisingly close from Joshua King! It was great link-up play between him and Simon Francis as King unleashed a shot at Fraser Forster. And it was something Forster did not know too much about as he looked startle and just say managed to make the save and quickly collect the loose ball.
11',action,"Bournemouth go close to a second thanks to a good run from Adam Smith. He fed the ball to Pugh who looked to drill it to the far post, though had Tuesday night's goalscorer had to time to compose himself, he could have had an effort himself. Bournemouth are dominating and the Saints can't get a sniff."
9',action,That goal looks to have shook Southampton who can't quite compose themselves at the moment. The Saints have won just one of their eight away games this season and now have their work cut out if they're going to change that today. Daniels shows that Bournemouth are taking the fight to the visitors as he surges into the box and then wins a throw.
6',assist,Assist Jack Wilshere. Fellow loanee Jack Wilshere whipped the ball in for Ake. The midfielder is having a great season at Bournemouth and has already played more minutes this season than the previous two combined.
6',goal,Goal Nathan Aké. GOAL! Bournemouth go 1-0 up thanks to Chelsea loanee Nathan Ake who isn't half making a name for himself at the Vitality Stadium. Ake wanted to get on the end of the ball more than anyone else in that box and he did just that as he scaped Cedric with a low diving header. What a start for the Cherries!
4',action,Ryan Bertrand causes more problems down the left as Charlie Daniels puts the ball out for a throw before the visitors win a corner. Bertrand is not so troublesome this time and Boruc takes the goal-kick. Bournemouth take their turn with two successive corners.
2',action,"Southampton get the first chance of the game as Ryan Bertrand takes the ball from Jack Wilshere, with the Arsenal loanee seemingly lucky to escape punishment from referee Mark Clattenburg after a dubious foul. At the other end of the pitch the hosts win a corner which is ordered to be took again, but comes to nothing."
1',action,Southampton get us underway in this South Coast derby.
,action,"Eddie Howe opts to make one change to the side who beat Leicester in the mid-week fixtures as Callum Smith comes in for Benfik Afobe who drops to the bench. Meanwhile, Southampton see numerous changes as Cuco Martina, Jose Fonte, Shane Long and James Ward-Prowse, drop to the bench whilst Jordy Clasie, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, James Rodriguez and Maya Yoshida return to the starting eleven."
,action,"SUBS: Taylor, Long, Davis, Martina, Ward-Proswe, Tadic, Fonte."
,action,"Southampton XI: Forster, Cedric, Yoshida, Clasie, Rodriguez, Van Dijk, Reed, Boufal, Bertrand, Redmond Hojbjerg."
,action,"SUBS: Federeci, Mings, B.Smith, Gosling, Ibe, Fraser, Afobe."
,action,"Bournemouth XI: Boruc, Francis, Cook, Ake, Daniels, Smith, Arter, Wilshere, Pugh, King, Wilson."
,action,TEAM NEWS:
,action,"Bournemouth have lost just two home matches all season and won’t want to change that tomorrow, with their only defeats coming to Manchester United and Sunderland. Unlike Southampton, goal scoring has been somewhat of a virtue this season for Howe’s side, particularly at home. News of Callum Wilson being cleared of concussion following a head injury against Leicester is something that may help that continue, though Ryan Fraser is set to miss out."
,action,"Claude Puel’s men have lost just one of their last five games and head to the Vitaly Stadium in good stead and will look to continue their good form, though they will have to do so without Oriol Romeu who misses out through suspension. In more positive news, Cedric Soares returns after missing the Saints’ previous two matches through illness. Impressive as Southampton’s form has been, their goal scoring has become something of an issue and Puel’s side have just three goals in their past seven league games and with Charlie Austin on the sidelines for sometime, the head coach will be counting the days until the transfer window."
,action,"The two teams sit side by side in the table, both on 21 points with the visitors marginally ahead on goal difference. The pair will battle it on the South coast with each of them off the back of a good midweek performance. Eddie Howe’s men play their second successive home game after seeing off Leicester 1-0 on Tuesday with a first-half goal from Marc Pugh enough to do the job. The Saints on the other hand held ten man Stoke to a draw at the Bet 365."
