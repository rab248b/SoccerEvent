,action,"In the end, a draw seems to be a well-deserved result for both sides, even though it adds a replay to their busy schedules. Huddersfield were arguably the best side in the first half before dropping off slightly after the break, but they defended really well to constantly frustrate a City side that didn't look entirely comfortable in front of goal."
,action,FULL-TIME: HUDDERSFIELD TOWN 0-0 MANCHESTER CITY
90'+4',action,"The swinging corner finds Stones in front of goal, but the centre-back is unable to guide his headed effort into the back of the net and sends it a few yards wide of its intended target. That should be that."
90'+3',action,"The ball pinballs dangerously around the Huddersfield box before eventually falling to Zabaleta, who then sees his thumping volley deflect out for a corner. The visitors are unable to make it count, however, and have to settle for another one over on the right wing."
90'+1',action,"A half-hearted City attacking move breaks down and allows Huddersfield to fly forward on a quick counter-attack, but Brown is unable to poke a cross into the path of Wells and loses out to Zabaleta inside the penalty area."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be three minutes of added time.
88',action,"Kachunga twists and turns over on the right wing as he easily skips past his marker and cuts inside, but he ends up shooting instead of teeing up a team-mate and curls a strike well wide of the City goal."
86',action,"Zabaleta makes a great run into the right-hand side of the Huddersfield penalty area before chipping a cross over towards Fernandinho, but Coleman rises high to cut out the danger with a comfortable catch."
84',action,"Kachunga cuts inside from the right flank on a great run before being caught from behind by a cynical challenge from Sagna, resulting in a free-kick for Huddersfield. Whitehead steps up and curls a cross into the penalty area, but Kachunga is unable to test Bravo with a decent shot after finally being able to control the ball on the edge of the box."
82',action,"A long pass is fired down the right wing and into the penalty area, where it finds Coleman. The goalkeeper reaches the ball well but scuffs it into the path of De Bruyne. However, the referee immediately awards a free-kick to Huddersfield for a foul by the Belgian, despite there not looking as if there was much contact made."
80',action,"Navas skips past his marker deep down the right wing before swinging a cross towards the near post, where it finds Coleman. The youngster is unable to keep it in play, however, and it results in a corner that Stones heads several yards over the top of the crossbar."
78',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Aleksandar Kolarov sub-in Bacary Sagna . Kolarov is caught slightly by Kachunga as the two battle for the ball, and he's forced off to be replaced by sub-in Bacary Sagna."
77',action,Huddersfield are starting to push further forward as they try to find a late goal. City started the second half the better of the two sides but have really dropped off over the last quarter of an hour or so.
75',action,"Cranie twists and turns on the right-hand side of the City penalty area before chipping a dangerous cross into the middle of the box. It looks set to cause the visitors a few problems, but Stones is just about able to head the ball away from danger after Bravo's attempt to do so is unconvincing."
73',action,"What a ball by Navas! The Spaniard, who has largely struggled over on the right wing, fires a beautiful ball across the face of goal, but there's no one there to meet it. Any sort of contact surely would have resulted in a City goal!"
72',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Jack Payne sub-in Isaiah Brown . Huddersfield have made their final alteration, with Izzy Brown coming on to take the place of Payne."
71',action,"Payne embarks on another good run forward as he weaves his way down the right wing, but he's unable to pick out Kachunga in front of him and loses out on the edge of the penalty area."
69',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Manuel Agudo Durán sub-in Leroy Sané . And the second is Nolito, who makes way for Leroy Sane."
69',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Fabian Delph sub-in Kevin De Bruyne . City have made a double substitution as they try to find an opening goal. The first player to make way is Delph, who is replaced by sub-in Kevin De Bruyne."
67',action,"Coleman is able to get back to his feet and the game gets underway once again. Huddersfield imediately plough forward on a determined attacking move, but Billing is penalised for a foul just as Payne tries to sprint into the penalty area."
65',action,"Coleman seemed to land awkwardly as he rose high to steal the ball away from Otamendi, and he's given himself a few problems as a result. However, it looks as if he'll be able to continue after receiving medical attention for a few moments."
64',action,"Nolito and Delph link up deep down the left wing before the latter fires a cross off Hudson and out for a corner. It's swung over to the edge of the penalty area by Nolito and finds Kolarov, but the Serbian is unable to pick out a team-mate with his volleyed pass back into the box."
62',action,"Kachunga shows good skills as he embarks on an impressive run in from the right wing, but he's eventually closed down by Delph and ends up fouling the midfielder from behind as they both battle for the ball."
60',action,"Wells makes an immediate impact as he weaves his way into the right-hand side of the City penalty area and wins the hosts a corner, but it fails to result in a chance on goal as the cross into the box is a poor one."
59',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Rajiv van La Parra sub-in Elias Kachunga . And the second is sub-in Elias Kachunga, who takes the place of Van La Parra."
59',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Joe Lolley sub-in Nahki Wells . Huddersfield, who haven't started the second half particularly well, have decided to make a double substitution. The first player to come on is sub-in Nahki Wells, who replaces Lolley."
58',action,"Kolarov is caught by Lolley as he tries to cut inside from the left, and City are immediately awarded a free-kick in a dangerous position. Nolito steps up and curls a cross towards Otamendi, but Quaner is there to fire the ball away from danger at the vital moment."
56',action,"Stankovic holds up the ball in the middle of the pitch as he waits for his team-mates to join him. He then pokes a smart pass down the left wing and into the path of Holmes-Dennis, who quickly swings a cross into the box, but Lolley is unable to make decent contact with the ball in front of goal."
54',action,"Nolito and Kolarov link up well over on the left flank, allowing the full-back to whip in a low cross. It looks set to find a City player in front of goal but Cranie is just about able to stop it from doing so with an outstretched foot at the near post."
52',action,"Lolley gets himself into a good position on the right-hand side of the City penalty area before chipping a cross into the heart of the box, but it's poorly hit by the winger and is easily cut out by the chest of Fernando in front of goal."
50',action,"Aguero skips past Hudson beautifully in the middle of the pitch before threading a quick pass into the path of Delph inside the penalty area, but, despite his best efforts, the midfielder is unable to reach the ball and loses out to Coleman."
49',action,"Fernandinho catches Dean Whitehead with a late challenge and gives away a free-kick midway inside the City half of the pitch, but Huddersfield aren't able to make the set-piece count and end up firing the ball out for a goal-kick."
47',action,"City quickly push forward on a determined attack through Aguero, and the Argentine is then able to unleash a thumping low shot from just outside of the Huddersfield box that's well stopped by Coleman at full stretch."
46',action,We're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"It's been an evenly matched game so far, with both sides enjoying several good chances in front of goal. Huddersfield went closest to going ahead when Billing fired the ball into the back of the net from close range, but the goal was rightly flagged offside. Since then, City have slowly but surely started to come back into the game, but they remain nervy at the back and far too open when the home side counter quickly."
,action,HALF-TIME: HUDDERSFIELD TOWN 0-0 MANCHESTER CITY
45'+1',action,"Nolito and Aguero link up well on the edge of the Huddersfield penalty area before the latter breaks into the box. He twists and turns and finally is able to get a cross away, but it can only find Jon Stankovic, who then calmly chests the ball back to Coleman."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be just one minute of added time.
44',action,"John Stones is caught in possession in a dangerous position inside the City half of the pitch, allowing Van La Parra to fly down the left flank on a marauding run. He gets himself into a good position before firing a deep cross over to Lolley, whose first touch is poor and results in him being unable to get a shot away."
43',action,"Navas gets himself into a good position over on the right wing once again before trying to pick out a team-mate with a swinging cross into the box, but, not for the first time this afternoon, it's poorly hit by the Spaniard and bounces straight into the hands of Coleman."
41',action,"Chance for Aguero! A lovely chipped pass from Fernandinho flies through the Huddersfield back line and finds Aguero in a pocket of space in front of goal, but the Argentine's rushed shot is well saved by Coleman, who pushes it away from danger with a diving stop."
39',action,"Nolito shakes off Billing before playing a smart pass out to Navas on the right flank. The winger then cuts inside quickly before picking out his fellow Spaniard once again, but the one-two that they try to pull off fails to work and is easily dealt with by Huddersfield."
37',action,"Van La Parra goes close! Quaner skips past Kolarov far too easily deep down the right flank before cutting inside and teeing up Van La Parra, but the Dutchman's low shot from the edge of the penalty area is well saved by Bravo in the middle of the City goal."
36',action,"Zabaleta gets himself into a good position just outside of the Huddersfield box after playing a quick one-two with Navas, but the Argentine's curling cross from 20 yards out fails to find a team-mate in front of goal."
35',action,"Fernando catches Lolley with a late challenge and gifts Huddersfield with another opportunity to swing a cross into the City penalty area from a free-kick. Payne steps up and sends a looping ball into the box, but it's completely overhit and sails harmlessly out of play for a goal-kick."
33',action,"Nolito goes close! Pablo Zabaleta and Aguero link up well deep down the right flank before the full-back chips a cross right on to the foot of Nolito, but the Spaniard's thumping volley is deflected just wide of the near post."
31',action,"Kolarov is dispossessed by a fantastic sliding tackle from Cranie, resulting in yet another Huddersfield counter-attack. It slows down slightly when Payne reaches the edge of the penalty area, and Quaner is then unable to muscle his way through a sea of City players."
29',action,"Aguero picks up the ball just outside of the Huddersfield box before threading a lovely pass through to Delph. The midfielder is in a great position in front of goal but his first touch is poor, meaning that he has to poke a hopeful shot towards Coleman that's easily saved by the goalkeeper."
27',action,"Billing scores, but it's ruled out for offside! City are unable to deal with the resulting corner, allowing the ball to pinball dangerously around the penalty area. It then falls to Billing after Hudson's poked shot is saved by Bravo, but Van La Parra is standing in an offside position in front of the goalkeeper and results in the goal being ruled out just as the hosts started to celebrate wildly."
26',action,"So close from Payne! The attacking midfielder steps up and unleashes a great strike that looks set for the back of the net, but it's tipped over the top of the crossbar by the fingertips of Bravo, who stretched well to reach the ball."
25',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Aleksandar Kolarov. Kolarov is caught in possession by Joe Lolley, who then bursts down the right wing. The midfielder does well to get forward before trying to penetrate the penalty area, but he's brought down from behind by a poor challenge from the Serbian defender, resulting in a free-kick for the hosts and a yellow card for the full-back."
24',action,"First chance for Sergio Aguero! A thumping clearance is fired down the pitch and towards the Huddersfield penalty area, where it finds Aguero in a good position. Coleman rushes out to deal with the danger but is unable to do so, leaving him horrendously exposed, but, luckily for the young goalkeeper, the Argentine fires his volley shot over the top of the crossbar."
23',action,"Billing is caught by an outstretched leg from Kolarov and wins Huddersfield a free-kick in a promising position over on the right flank. It's fired down the wing and into the path of Van La Parra, but there's nobody there to meet it."
21',action,"A poor attempted pass back towards Coleman by Philip Billing takes a deflection off a City player and results in a moment of panic for the Huddersfield back line, but Hudson is just about able to cut out the danger before the visitors can take advantage of the error."
19',action,"Another long ball forward causes a few problems for the City defence, but Van La Parra is unable to pick out a team-mate with his cross and has to settle for a throw-in. The Dutchman then cuts inside and this time manages to tee up Quaner inside the penalty area, but the striker ends up stumbling and handling the ball before he can unleash a shot."
17',action,"Nolito picks up the ball in a promising position once again before trying to unleash Navas with a volleyed, long-range pass over the top of the Huddersfield defence. There's far too much power behind it, however, and Coleman is easily able to collect the ball under no pressure whatsoever."
15',action,"Nolito cuts inside from the left wing after linking up with Aleksandar Kolarov and then tries to test Coleman with a 30-yard strike, but it's poorly hit by the Spaniard and ends up sailing comfortably wide of the Huddersfield goal."
13',action,"A lofted pass from deep inside the Huddersfield half of the pitch finds Quaner in a promising position. He brings the ball down well and spins past his marker before trying to tee up Payne to his left, but Fernando is there to dispossess the striker at the vital moment."
11',action,"What an opportunity for City! Nolito breaks through the middle of the Huddersfield back line before taking on Joel Coleman, but the goalkeeper dives at the Spaniard's feet to keep his shot from finding the back of the net. The ball then rolls out to Jesus Navas, but his follow-up is stopped at the near post by Hudson."
9',action,"Almost a mistake by City! The visitors slowly pass the ball around before Fernando knocks it back to Bravo. The pass is poorly executed, however, and almost allows Quaner to receive possession before the goalkeeper is finally able to blast the ball away."
8',action,"Nolito and Martin Cranie battle for the ball over on the left wing before City are awarded a free-kick for a pull on the Spaniard. The set-piece is fired into the middle of the box and almost finds a City player in front of goal, but Mark Hudson is there to head the ball away from danger."
6',action,"Early chance for Huddersfield! City are caught asleep deep down the right wing and lose out to Collin Quaner. The German immediately charges across the edge of the penalty area before teeing up Rajiv van La Parra, who then unleashes a curling shot from 20 yards out that Claudio Bravo does well to save."
4',action,"City manage to hold on to possession for a decent length of time and work it around patiently just inside their own half of the pitch. Fabian Delph then darts down the left wing on a quick run as he tries to latch on to a long pass forward, but he sets off slightly too early and is swiftly flagged offside."
2',action,"Huddersfield quickly put City under plenty of pressure and carve out a chance on goal for themselves. It's closed down quickly by Nicolas Otamendi, however, and Jack Payne's shot from the edge of the penalty area is deflected out for a corner. The set-piece is fired in low towards the near post but, once again, the visitors are able to deal with the danger."
1',action,"We're off! Huddersfield get us underway, attacking from right to left."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."
,action,"Meanwhile, City boss Pep Guardiola has made eight alterations to the team that featured in their last outing, with Willy Caballero, Bacary Sagna, Kevin De Bruyne, Yaya Toure, David Silva, Raheem Sterling, Gabriel Jesus and Leroy Sane all making way for Claudio Bravo, Pablo Zabaleta, Nicolas Otamendi, Fabian Delph, Fernando, Jesus Navas, Nolito and Sergio Aguero."
,action,"David Wagner has decided to make seven changes to the Huddersfield side that started the 3-2 victory away to Rotherham United on the weekend, with Joel Coleman, Jon Stankovic, Martin Cranie, Mark Hudson, Dean Whitehead, Jack Payne and Rajiv van La Parra coming into the starting line-up to replace Danny Ward, Tommy Smith, Michael Hefele, Christopher Schindler, Aaron Mooy, Izzy Brown and Elias Kachunga, respectively."

,action,"Huddersfield Town XI: Coleman; Stankovic, Cranie, Hudson, Holmes-Dennis; Billing, Whitehead; Lolley, Payne, Van La Parra; Quaner."
,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"Both sides enjoyed comfortable wins in their two previous FA Cup outings this season, with neither conceding a single goal so far. Huddersfield easily saw off Port Vale and Rochdale with thumping 4-0 victories, whilst City thrashed West Ham 5-0 before going on to enjoy a pain-free 3-0 win away to Crystal Palace in the fourth round."
,action,"Despite showing some frailties along the way, things have improved for City in recent weeks and they currently sit in second place in the Premier League table thanks to three consecutive victories. Despite coming against teams that currently sit either 10th or lower, Pep Guardiola’s men have looked far more assured at both ends of the pitch, and, despite the impressive nature of David Wagner’s Huddersfield, are still favourites to pick up another victory here this afternoon."
,action,"Excellent recent victories against fellow promotion chasers Brighton & Hove Albion and Leeds United further solidified serious belief in the club about their chances of reaching the top tier for the first time since 1972, and a win today against one of the big boys would only increase that feeling. Huddersfield have scored 14 goals in their last five outings, and they will be aiming to inflict similar pain on a City defence that has looked less than stellar at several points this season."
,action,"On paper, City should be favourites to comfortably ease their way into the last-eight of the competition, but Pep Guardiola will be well aware of the danger posed by Huddersfield and the wonderful form in which the Championship side currently find themselves. David Wagner’s impressive team have lost just one of their previous 15 games, resulting in them firmly embedding themselves in the promotion play-off zone."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s FA Cup fifth round game between Huddersfield Town and Manchester City at the John Smith’s Stadium.
