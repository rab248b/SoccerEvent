,action,"A few boos ring around the KCOM Stadium as the referee blows his whistle for the final time, but, overall, most home fans won't be too upset with the point gained today. Their side were poor in the first half but impressed after the break as they took advantage of lazy play from West Brom. The visitors really should have gone on to pick up all three points after dominating in the opening period but failed to build on their momentum, giving Hull a chance to come back into the game."
,action,FULL-TIME: HULL CITY 1-1 WEST BROMWICH ALBION
90'+4',action,"Rondon almost wins it for West Brom! McClean sends a wonderful cross into the heart of the Hull penalty area and finds Rondon in a pocket of space in the front of goal, but the Venezuelan is unable to find the back of the net and ends up sending his effort bouncing just past the far post. He really should have buried that!"
90'+3',substitution,Substitution sub-out Josh Tymon sub-in Andrew Robertson . 17-year-old Tymon receives a rousing round of applause from the home fans as he's replaced by Robertson in Hull's final substitution of the game.
90'+2',action,"West Brom try to push forward on a late attack as they attempt to find a late winner, but Hull have enough bodies back and, despite a nervy piece of defending from Dawson, are able to deal with the danger before the captain fires the ball out for a throw-in."
90'+1',action,"Almost a costly mistake by Foster! The goalkeeper darts out of his penalty area and tries to clear the danger but can only fire the ball straight into the feet of Diomande. The Norwegian receives it just inside the West Brom half of the pitch and attempts to cut on to his right foot before shooting, but by the time he's able to do so Foster is back in his goal and the effort ends up rolling comfortably wide of the goal."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be four minutes of added time.
89',action,"The ball pinballs around the Hull penalty area, but no matter what they try to do, West Brom just can't seem to test Marshall. Rondon does well to out-muscle Davies before poking the ball over to Chadli, but the latter is closed down quickly and ends up firing his close-range strike off Dawson."
88',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Markus Henriksen sub-in David Meyler . Hull have made a late substitution, with Meyler coming on to take the place of Henriksen."
87',action,"Excellent strike by Chadli! A poor attempted clearance by Dawson flies up into the air and down to Rondon, who is then dragged to the ground by the Hull defender and wins his side a free-kick. Chadli steps up and fires a brilliant, curling shot towards goal, but Marshall dives to his right to tip it round the post and out for a corner."
85',action,"What a chance for Robson-Kanu to make an immediate impact! Elmohamady steps off McClean and allows the Irishman to whip a brilliant cross over to the far post, but Robson-Kanu ends up sending his headed effort several yards wide of the goal after easily beating Tymon in the air."
83',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Matt Phillips sub-in Hal Robson-Kanu . That will be Phillips' last involvement in the game, as he's replaced by Robson-Kanu for the final seven minutes."
83',action,"Phillips breaks into the right-hand side of the Hull box and sends yet another dangerous cross into the heart of the box, but, not for the first time this afternoon, Dawson is there to meet the ball first and fire it away from danger."
82',action,"Another vital interception by McAuley! Again, Hull almost tear the West Brom back line in two with a clever poked pass into the penalty area and towards Mbokani, but Snodgrass' pass is cut out by the outstretched foot of McAuley at the vital moment."
81',action,"Phillips holds up the ball well just outside of the Hull penalty area before poking a deft pass into the path of Rondon. The striker makes a great run into the box as he tries to latch on to the ball, but he ends up pushing Davies to the ground in the process and gives away a free-kick."
79',substitution,"Substitution sub-out James Morrison sub-in Nacer Chadli . West Brom have made a late alteration, with Morrison making way for Chadli, who comes on to make his return from injury."
78',action,"Elmohamady links up well with Snodgrass over on the right wing before swinging a cross into the penalty area, but it's sent slightly past Mbokani and fails to result in a chance on goal. Clucas does well to pick up the ball on the left flank, however, before sending it back into the box, but, again, the cross isn't a good one."
77',action,"Phillips picks up the ball on the right-hand side of the Hull penalty area and quickly fires a low cross into the middle of the box. It's well hit and sent into a very dangerous area, but Dawson is there to scoop the ball away before it can find a blue and white shirt in front of goal."
75',action,"Hull go close again! The home side win themselves another free-kick, this time over on the right wing, and once again it causes problems for West Brom. It's curled by Elmohamady into the middle of the box before finding McAuley, but the defender slips at the worst possible moment and is just about able to guide the ball into the hands of Foster."
73',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Adama Valentin Diomande. Nyom tries to break away through the middle of the pitch but is dragged back by Diomande, who becomes the latest player to receive a yellow card as a result."
72',assist,"Assist Dieumerci Mbokani Bezua. West Brom should have defended the free-kick better, but Mbokani did wonderfully well to beat his marker in the air before teeing up Dawson. The striker has looked far better since Diomande came on to give him some support."
72',goal,"Goal Michael Dawson. GOAL! Hull have equalised! Snodgrass sends the set-piece flying towards the back post, where it finds Mbokani. The striker rises high above his marker and nods the ball down to Dawson, who then fires a quick half-volley past Foster and into the bottom right-hand corner of the net."
71',action,Phillips clumsily trips Diomande to the ground as the two battle for the ball and gives away a free-kick in an advantageous position for Hull. Can the home side take advantage of a great opportunity to get back into the game?
69',action,"West Brom are starting to enjoy more of the possession after a period on the back foot, but they don't seem in any great rush to push forward. They've defended resolutely and have limited Hull's chances on goal, but at the other end of the pitch they've continued to look slightly lacking in ideas."
67',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Jonny Evans. West Brom have been taking their time with set-pieces as they already try to run down the clock, and Evans is eventually shown a yellow card after spending an age to take a free-kick from deep within the visitors' half of the pitch."
66',action,"Vital block by McAuley! A lofted pass is thumped up towards the edge of the West Brom penalty area and finds Diomande in a good position. The Norwegian nods the ball down to Mbokani and the latter then fires a thumping half-volley towards goal, but it fails to beat McAuley just in front of him."
65',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Darren Fletcher sub-in James McClean . Fletcher, who still seems to be struggling after picking up an injury in the first half, makes way for McClean in West Brom's first substitution of the afternoon."
64',action,"West Brom quickly win the ball back and work it over to Phillips on the right flank. He cuts inside and beats Tymon with ease before shooting, but it's mishit and ends up rolling a few yards wide of the near post."
63',action,"Phillips takes on Davies and is eventually able to whip a cross into the penalty area at the second time of asking. It's brilliantly hit by the winger and looks set to find Rondon, but Dawson is just about able to get a head on the ball to stop it from doing so."
62',action,"Snodgrass goes close! The midfielder steps up and fires a great low shot towards the bottom left-hand corner of the net, but Foster quickly dives to his right to parry the strike away from goal."
61',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Gareth McAuley. Mbokani receives the ball with his back to goal and is immediately brought crashing to the ground by a hefty challenge from McAuley, resulting in Hull being awarded a free-kick just a few yards outside of the West Brom penalty area. What a chance this is for the home side..."
60',action,"Dawson cuts inside from the right flank and heads towards the byline before being dispossessed by a well-timed sliding tackle from Tymon, which results in a corner for West Brom. Once again, it's curled over to McAuley at the far post, but Davies is there to beat him to the ball."
58',action,"Henriksen does well to break down the right wing before firing a low cross off Evans and out for a corner. It's whipped into a dangerous position in the heart of the penalty area and looks set to find a Hull player, but Rondon is there to deal with the danger."
57',action,"Great opportunity for Clucas! The midfielder makes a wonderful run into the penalty area and is picked out in acres of space by Snodgrass, but his headed effort is mistimed and ends up sailing comfortably wide of the far post."
56',action,"Phillips takes on and beats Tymon deep down the right wing before chipping a cross into the middle of the penalty area and towards Rondon, but it's sent too near to Marshall and is easily collected by the goalkeeper."
54',action,"Livermore goes close! Hull move the ball around brilliantly before Henriksen picks out Livermore with a wonderful reverse pass, but the Englishman's low strike is well saved by Foster in the middle of the goal."
53',action,"Elmohamady cheaply loses possession deep down the right wing, allowing West Brom to quickly hit Hull on a counter-attack. Morrison charges through the middle of the pitch on a great run before taking on Snodgrass, but the latter comes out on top."
51',action,"Hull quickly win the ball back before Elmohamady tees up Snodgrass in another good position in the middle of the pitch. This time, the Scottish midfielder is able to test Foster with a thumping low strike, but Foster gets down well to save the effort."
50',action,"Diomande, who has made a good impact since coming on to the pitch, muscles his way forward on a marauding run through the middle. He's closed down by Nyom but is just about able to tee up Snodgrass, who unleashes a low strike that Yacob does well to close down."
49',action,"Morrison picks up the ball in the middle of the pitch and immediately lifts a lovely pass over the Hull back line and into the path of Phillips. The winger darts towards the edge of the penalty area and puts Marshall under pressure, but the goalkeeper rushes out before heading the ball away from danger."
48',action,"Rondon breaks into the left-hand side of the Hull penalty area and spins before trying to tee up Morrison on the edge of the box, but the Venezuelan's attempted pass is poorly hit and fails to find any West Brom player."
47',action,"Hull immediately go on the offensive and win themselves an early corner over on the right wing. Snodgrass steps up and whips a dangerous cross into the heart of the penalty area, but Rondon is just about able to get a touch on the ball to send it away from Mbokani."
46',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Ryan Mason sub-in Adama Valentin Diomande . Hull have decided to make a change, and it's an attacking one, with Mason making way for Diomande."
46',action,And we're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half.
,action,"The referee brings an end to the first half and boos ring around the KCOM Stadium. The home fans really aren't happy with what they've seen, and it's no wonder why. Hull have performed poorly thus far, with the West Brom back line barely being tested. The hosts haven't had a single shot on target yet, resulting in Foster being a mere spectator in between the sticks. Phelan will have to make some sort of change if his side are to have any hope of getting themselves back into the game."
,action,HALF-TIME: HULL CITY 0-1 WEST BROMWICH ALBION
45'+3',action,"Morrison and Brunt link up wonderfully well on the left-hand side of the Hull box before the latter chips a cross towards Phillips, but Tymon is just about able to head the ball away from danger just as the Scottish winger is about to pull the trigger."
45'+1',action,"West Brom immediately push forward from the resulting free-kick and win themselves another corner, this time over on the right flank. Phillips' cross isn't good enough, however, as it swings out of play before landing in a great position in the middle of the penalty area."
45',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Sam Clucas. Rondon holds up the ball well before teeing up Fletcher, who is immediately clattered into by Clucas. The West Brom captain isn't at all happy with the challenge, and the Hull midfielder eventually receives a yellow card."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be three minutes of added time.
44',action,"Dawson goes close! Again, another lovely cross from Phillips causes problems for Dawson, but the centre-back's headed effort from close range fails to trouble Marshall after he slightly mistimed his jump."
43',action,Brunt picks up the ball in a good position over on the left wing and immediately swings a cross into the middle of the box that finds Rondon. The striker is in a good position in front of goal but has to settle for a corner after firing his first-time shot off the outstretched leg of Davies.
42',action,"Fletcher looks to be struggling after going down after landing awkwardly. It seems to be a sprained ankle for the West Brom captain, but for now it looks as if he's going to try and see if he can shake off the injury before half-time."
40',action,"Hull keep coming back at West Brom, but they're unable to do enough to cause the visitors any real problems. Again, they try to find joy down the right wing before Elmohamady is finally able to swing a cross into the penalty area, but there's nobody there to meet it and Foster is easily able to collect the ball under no pressure whatsoever."
38',action,"Elmohamady and Snodgrass play a quick one-two between themselves deep down the right flank before the latter tries to beat Brunt on the edge of the penalty area, but the West Brom midfielder stands tall and dispossesses the number 10 with a well-timed tackle."
36',action,"Hull try to push forward from the restart as they attempt to quickly get back into the game, but they're unable to do so and an attempted cross-field pass fails to find Mbokani and instead sails out of play for a throw-in."
34',assist,"Assist Matt Phillips. Phillips, who has seen little of the ball thus far, did wonderfully well to pick out McAuley in the middle of the box, but questions have to be asked of Hull, who didn't do well enough to track the defender's run towards goal."
34',goal,"Goal Gareth McAuley. GOAL! West Brom have taken the lead! Nyom gets forward once again before being put under pressure by Elmohamady, forcing him into playing the ball off the Egyptian and out for a corner. Phillips steps up and curls a lovely cross right on to the head of McAuley, who easily beats Marshall with a wonderful downward header."
32',action,"Mbokani and Henriksen link up well in the middle of the pitch before the latter tries to muscle his way into the West Brom penalty area, but he's quickly closed down by a sea of white and blue shirts and loses out before he's able to do so."
30',action,"Brunt steps up and curls a deep cross over to the far post, where Phillips is waiting, but Mbokani gets in front of the winger and beats him to the ball before doing well to win the hosts a throw-in after breaking forward."
29',yellow-card,"Yellow Card Michael Dawson. Nyom charges down the left flank on a marauding run before taking on Dawson, but the Hull defender brings the full-back crashing to the ground and gives away a free-kick in a very dangerous position. Can West Brom make it count?"
27',action,"Evans and Brunt link up well midway inside the Hull half of the pitch before the latter spins and finds Nyom. The full-back is in a pocket of space and quickly tries to send a cross into the path of Rondon, but it's overhit and sails high and wide of the goal."
25',action,"West Brom come back once again before Phillips tries to test Marshall with a shot from just outside of the box, but, like Morrison's a few moments ago, it's not hit cleanly enough to trouble the Hull goalkeeper."
24',action,"Chance for Morrison! Livermore, who hasn't started the game particularly well, loses the ball in the middle of the pitch and allows West Brom to break away on a swift counter-attack. Rondon does well to charge forward before teeing up Morrison on the edge of the penalty area, but his scuffed strike is poor and rolls comfortably wide of the far post."
22',action,"Evans breaks forward on a rare run into the hosts' half of the pitch before winning West Brom a throw-in over on the left flank. It's taken quickly and worked over to Dawson, but his attempted pass towards Phillips is poor and easily cut out by Tymon."
20',action,"Phillips performs well in the middle of the pitch before teeing up Dawson over on the right flank. The full-back quickly sends a curling cross into the heart of the Hull penalty area, but it misses Rondon before Elmohamady chests the ball into the hands of Marshall."
18',action,"Brunt and Dawson try to muscle their way down the right wing before the latter settles for a throw-in. It's worked into the middle of the pitch before heading back to Brunt, but his high, looping cross fails to find Rondon and is easily collected by Marshall."
16',action,"Evans trips Snodgrass from behind over on the right wing and Hull are awarded their first free-kick of the game. It's worked to Mbokani, who holds the ball up well before trying to play a quick one-two with Livermore on the edge of the penalty area, but Evans is there to deal with the danger."
14',action,"Now it's Fletcher who loses the ball cheaply, allowing Hull to push forward on an attack of their own. They do so patiently before Snodgrass picks up possession over on the right flank, but he too is guilty of cheap play and fails to take advantage of the opportunity to carve out a chance on goal."
12',action,"A poor touch from Mason gifts possession back to West Brom just inside the visitors' half of the pitch. They move it around quickly before Dawson fires a lofted pass down the right flank and into the path of Rondon, but it's slightly overhit and bounces out of play before it can find the striker."
11',action,"Phillips gets himself into a good position in the middle of the pitch before curling a bouncing cross into the heart of the Hull penalty area. It's well hit but fails to find Rondon, who was unable to break forward quickly enough to meet the pass."
9',action,"After sitting on the back foot for the opening nine minutes, Hull are able to push forward on their first real attacking move of the afternoon. Snodgrass does well to gget down the right flank before teeing up Elmohamady, but the latter's cross into the penalty area is poor and fails to beat Evans."
8',action,"Rondon holds up the ball well and links up with Dawson before poking the ball back to Fletcher. The captain spots a run forward from Brunt and tries to pick out the midfielder with a pass down the right flank, but it's horribly hit and rolls out of play for a throw-in."
6',action,"Yacob was clattered into by Livermore as the two battled for the ball in the build-up to West Brom's last chance on goal, leaving the Argentine in a heap on the floor inside the box. It initially looks as if he's picked up an injury that could bring his game to a premature end, but, after a couple of moments receiving medical treatment, he's able to get back to his feet."
5',action,"Hull are only able to clear the ball as far as Phillips, who then curls a great cross into the middle of the penalty area. Once again, it heads towards McAuley in front of goal, but the defender's headed effort has slightly too much power behind it and ends up clearing the top of the crossbar."
4',action,"West Brom keep putting pressure on Hull and do well to win themselves two corners in quick succession. The second is whipped in by Brunt and almost finds McAuley at the far post, but Marshall does well to get a hand on the ball to stop it from finding the centre-back."
3',action,"Another chance for Morrison! Dawson cuts inside from the right wing and beats Mason far too easily before teeing up Morrison in the middle of the penalty area, but he's unable to sort his feet out and, as a result, can't get a decent shot away."
2',action,"West Brom start the game positively as they move the ball from one flank to another. Morrison gets himself into a good position over on the right wing and quickly tries to test Marshall with a high cross-cum-shot, but it ends up landing right on the top of the net."
1',action,"And we're off! West Brom get us underway, attacking from left to right."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."
,action,"Meanwhile, West Brom boss Tony Pulis has also named an unchanged side to the one that won 4-0 at home to Burnley on Monday evening, with Nacer Chadli back on the substitutes’ bench after almost a month out."
,action,"Mike Phelan has decided to name an unchanged Hull side to the one that started the 3-0 defeat against Sunderland seven days ago, with Dieumerci Mbokani once again leading the line in his second consecutive start for the Tigers."
,action,"West Bromwich Albion substitutes: Palmer, Olsson, Galloway, Gardner, McClean, Chadli, Robson-Kanu."
,action,"West Bromwich Albion XI (4-2-3-1): Foster; Dawson, McAuley, Evans, Nyom; Fletcher, Yacob; Brunt, Morrison, Phillips; Rondon."
,action,"Hull City substitutes: Jakupovic, Robertson, Maguire, Huddlestone, Meyler, Bowen, Diomande."
,action,"Hull City XI (4-4-1-1): Marshall; Elmohamady, Dawson, Davies, Tymon; Snodgrass, Livermore, Mason, Clucas; Henriksen; Mbokani."
,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"Games between these two sides have often proven to be tight affairs, with only Hull managing to win by more than a one-goal margin in any of the last six meetings. West Brom narrowly won 1-0 in the last meeting back in January 2015, whilst that season’s meeting at the KCOM Stadium ended in a goalless draw."
,action,"Back-to-back victories mean that West Brom started the day in a very respectable ninth place, just three points behind Manchester United and with a chance of lifting themselves above them if they can win by two or more goals this afternoon. They were certainly in fine form last weekend as they mercilessly thumped Burnley 4-0 to record their joint-highest Premier League win of all time."
,action,"A slightly surprising 2-1 win against Southampton just before the international break gave Hull hope after their poor run of form saw them slip ever further down the table, but last weekend’s loss shows that there is still plenty of work to be done if they are to avoid dropping back down to the Championship. Today’s game could prove to be another tough one, as they must face a West Brom side full of confidence."
,action,"After enjoying a positive start to the season in which they picked up two wins and a draw from their opening four games, it’s been a tough two months for Hull, who sit inside the relegation zone with 10 points after losing seven of their previous eight league clashes, including a disappointing 3-0 defeat away to fellow strugglers Sunderland last weekend."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Premier League game between Hull City and West Bromwich Albion at the KCOM Stadium.
