,action,"Up until then, Cagliari had defended well and looked to be on course to pick up what would have been a well-deserved point, but they let their concentration slip at the vital moment and, as a result, leave empty-handed. That'll be tough for Rastelli to take, and it means that he remains under pressure after suffering another defeat on the road."
,action,"Milan were made to work extremely hard, but they just about managed to find a way through a resolute and well-organised Cagliari side to leave with three much-needed points. They struggled for the majority of the evening and rarely caused many problems in front of goal - with Bacca looking particularly poor - but they were given a boost by the introduction of Lapadula, resulting in Bacca finally finding the back of the net with a late, late winner."
,action,FULL-TIME: MILAN 1-0 CAGLIARI
90'+5',action,"Lapadula steps up and shoots from the resulting free-kick, but there's slightly too much power behind the strike and Rafael is able to watch it fly just a yard or so over the top of the crossbar."
90'+4',red-card,"Red Card Bruno Eduardo Regufe Alves. RED CARD! A lofted pass is thumped deep into the Cagliari half of the pitch and finds Bacca just outside of the box, but as soon as the Colombian makes contact with the ball, he's cynically dragged down from behind by Alves, who leaves the referee with no choice but to show him a red card."
90'+2',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Daniele Dessena sub-in Niccolo Giannetti . Cagliari have made a late substitution, with Dessena making way for Nicolo Giannetti."
90'+1',action,"Borriello bursts through the middle of the pitch as he desperately tries to get Cagliari back into the game, but he's closed down by three defenders as soon as he reaches the edge of the penalty area and is forced into spinning and sending the ball back towards the halfway line."
90',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be five minutes of added time.
88',yellow-card,Yellow Card Mauricio Aníbal Isla Isla. Yellow card Mauricio Aníbal Isla Isla
88',assist,Assist Gianluca Lapadula. Lapadula did wonderfully well to set up Bacca. The substitute has made a nuisance of himself since coming on to the pitch and showed great grit and determination to battle his way through the Cagliari defence.
88',goal,"Goal Carlos Arturo Bacca Ahumada. GOAL! Milan have broken the deadlock! A low cross from the right flanks finds Lapadula, who, with his back to goal, spins and pokes the ball into the path of Bacca. The Colombian breaks through the disjointed Cagliari defence and goes one-on-one with Rafael, who he's easily able to beat with a thumping strike from close range. What a way to end your goalscoring drought!"
86',action,"Suso cuts in from the right wing and sends another dangerous cross into the penalty area that finds Niang. The Frenchman rises high and does well to meet the ball before sending a glancing header over to Bacca, but the striker is unable to meet the ball at the far post, much to his annoyance."
84',action,The Milan fans are getting increasing restless as their side fail to carve out chances on goal. This time it's Locatelli who wastes a good opportunity after firing his attempted cross well away from Niang and out for a goal-kick.
82',action,"Cagliari, who have had few chances to push forward during the second half, string together a good series of passes before Dessena tries to test Donnarumma from the edge of the penalty area. He's unable to call the youngster into action, however, as his strike is far too powerful and sails well wide of its intended target."
81',action,"Lapadula makes an immediate impact as he makes a nuisance of himself on the edge of the Cagliari penalty area before being dragged to the ground by Alves. Suso tries to shoot from the resulting free-kick but can't beat the wall, and Bertolacci's follow-up then sails several yards over the top of the crossbar."
80',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Mario Pašalić sub-in Gianluca Lapadula . With just 10 minutes left to go, Montella has decided to go for it, with Pasalic making way for sub-in Gianluca Lapadula."
79',action,"Great save by Rafael! Suso wriggles his way through a group of white shirts before firing a low shot from just outside of the penalty area, but the Cagliari goalkeeper gets down well to parry the ball round the near post and out for a corner."
78',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Diego da Silva Farias sub-in João Pedro Geraldino dos Santos Galvão . Cagliari have made another change, with Farias making way for Joao Pedro."
77',action,"What a chance for Borriello! A half-hearted Milan attacking move breaks down and allows the substitute to fly forward on a marauding run down the right wing. He gets himself into a good position on the edge of the penalty area and has Isla up there with him, but, for some strange reason, he holds on to the ball instead of teeing up the Chilean and ends up losing out."
76',action,"Ball after ball is flung into the Cagliari box, but each is just about dealt with by the visitors. They've certainly defended well this evening and have made life extremely tough for Milan, who have struggled in front of goal."
74',action,"Pasalic drives into the right-hand side of the Cagliari penalty area before winning corner number 10 for the home side, but the set-piece is poorly hit and sails straight into the hands of Rafael at the near post."
73',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Marco Sau sub-in Marco Borriello . Cagliari have made their first alteration of the night, with sub-in Marco Borriello coming on to take the place of Sau."
72',action,"Niang and Bacca are presented with another great opportunity! Once again, the duo fail to test Rafael after getting close to a cross, as both are caught flat-footed in front of goal and miss making contact with the ball. It's not been a great evening for either."
70',action,"Suso is bundled over as he darts down the right wing, resulting in a free-kick for Milan in a dangerous position. The Spaniard steps up and curls a good cross into the heart of the box, but, after a few nervy moments, Cagliari are just about able to blast the ball away and out for a throw-in."
68',action,"Isla scores, but it's ruled out! Farias cuts inside from the left flank and unleashes a low shot that is deflected into the path of Isla in front of goal. The Chilean is all alone on the edge of the six-yard box and is easily able to poke the ball under Donnarumma and into the back of the net, but a few seconds after doing so, the linesman's flag is finally raised. The Cagliari players aren't at all happy with the lateness of the official's decision, but it stands nonetheless."
67',action,"Suso holds up the ball on the edge of the Cagliari box before spinning and picking out Locatelli. The midfielder is in a pocket of space and quickly shoots, but he's unable to catch the ball well enough to hit the target."
66',action,"Pisacane is left in acres of space by the Milan back line as he calmly breaks down the right flank. He then cuts inside before trying to pick out Sau with a curling cross, but it's poorly hit by the full-back, who had plenty of time but ended up rushing his pass."
65',substitution,"Substitution sub-out Giacomo Bonaventura sub-in Andrea Bertolacci . Milan have made their second change of the game, with Bonaventura making way for sub-in Andrea Bertolacci."
64',action,"Thumping strike from Niang! A curling cross from Suso finds Bacca, who then sends a glancing header back to Niang. The Frenchman is in a good position in front of goal and quickly unleashes a rocket of a volley, but it ends up swerving away from the goal and wide of the far post."
63',action,"Dessena breaks forward on another impressive run as he heads towards the Milan penalty area. He then cuts inside before picking out Farias with a smart pass into the box, but the Brazilian gets the ball caught between his feet and ends up losing out to Abate."
61',action,"Suso goes close! The Spaniard, who has performed well over on the right wing, cuts past Capuano once again before unleashing a cross-cum-shot, and it's one that Rafael fails to read and allows to bounce just inches wide of his far post."
59',action,"Milan clumsily lose possession in the middle of the pitch, allowing Cagliari to counter quickly. Dessena flies towards the Milan penalty area on a great run before trying to tee up Sau, but the pass is slightly underhit and, as a result, Paletta is just about able to dive in front of it on the edge of the box."
57',action,"Vital block by Ceppitelli! A low cross from Niang isn't particularly well hit but nonetheless finds Bonaventura. The midfielder quickly spins round his marker and shoots, but his low strike is well blocked by Ceppitelli to send it flying away from Rafael."
55',action,"Milan struggle to find a way through the sea of white shirts camped in front of them, resulting in Paletta trying to test Rafael with an audacious 35-yard strike. Unsurprisingly, the defender's shot fails to beat the Brazilian goalkeeper and instead flies comfortably wide of the goal."
53',action,"Another opportunity for Bacca! Niang charges down the left flank before winning his side another corner. It's fired over to the far post and bounces into the path of Bacca, but the striker is unable to control it quickly enough and is dispossessed before he can unleash a shot."
51',action,"And now Milan go close! Suso cuts past Marco Capuano on the right-hand side of the Cagliari box before swinging a beautiful cross into the heart of the penalty area, but it narrowly misses the head of Bacca before fizzing just past Niang at the far post. Any sort of contact surely would have resulted in the first goal of the game."
50',action,"What a chance for Daniele Dessena! Cagliari move the ball around wonderfully down the right flank before the captain is set up on the edge of the Milan penalty area, but his first-time shot ends up curling a yard or two over the top of the crossbar. That's arguably the best opportunity of the game thus far."
48',action,"A lofted pass is flung forward and finds Bonaventura, who rises high and quickly nods the ball into the path of Bacca. The Colombian is a yard or so offside, however, and the linesman's flag is raised as soon as he tries to spin and charge towards the penalty area."
46',action,And we're underway once again!
,action,The two teams are making their way back out on to the pitch ahead of the start of the second half. Neither side have made any substitutions during the half-time break.
,action,"It's been a frustrating opening 45 minutes for Milan, who have arguably been the better of the two sides but, so far, have struggled to break down a compact and well-organised Cagliari side. The visitors have continually put plenty of bodies behind the ball in an attempt to shut out the hosts, and they've done a good job of frustrating their opponents. Suso, Bacca and Niang have all struggled to get into the game, with the latter being forced into attempting to test Rafael with speculative shots from long range."
,action,HALF-TIME: MILAN 0-0 CAGLIARI
45'+2',action,"After dealing with the danger, Milan fly forward on a quick counter-attack and win themselves yet another corner. It's swung towards the edge of the six-yard box, where three red and black shirts are waiting, but it's sent too near to Rafael and is easily dealt with by the Brazilian."
45'+1',action,"Isla is presented with a good opportunity to swing a cross into the Milan box, but he's unable to beat Antonelli and has to settle for a corner of his own. It's curled into the middle of the penalty area and towards Sau, but Donnarumma dives in front of the ball to stop it from finding the striker."
45',action,The fourth official has indicated that there will be two minutes of added time.
44',action,"Antonelli darts down the left wing before swinging a cross into the penalty area, but it's deflected out for a Milan corner. The set-piece is half dealt with by Rafael, who punshes the ball out to Locatelli, and the midfielder then unleashes a screamer of a long-range strike that flies off the head of Di Gennaro and out for another corner."
42',action,"Cagliari patiently pass the ball around inside their own half of the pitch before it's played back to Rafael. The goalkeeper holds on to the ball for as long as possible as he tries to run down the clock, but he's put under pressure by Bacca and is almost caught out by the striker before he's finally able to blast the ball away."
40',action,"Suso picks up the ball over on the right wing and cuts inside quickly before shooting from the edge of the Cagliari penalty area, but he's unable to catch the ball well enough to trouble Rafael, who is easily able to deal with the Spaniard's tame effort."
38',action,"Another chance for Sau! Diego Farias is picked out by Di Gennaro in a pocket of space deep down the right wing and quickly tees up Sau on the edge of the Milan penalty area, but the striker's first-time shot takes a slight deflection off the head of Gabriel Paletta that sends it flying over the top of the crossbar."
36',action,"Sau charges down the right wing as he tries to latch on to a loose ball and carve out a rare chance on goal for Cagliari, but he doesn't have the pace to beat Romagnoli and ends up losing out to the defender."
34',action,"Di Gennaro loses out midway inside the Milan half of the pitch and gifts the home side with a chance to counter quickly. They initially do so well through Pasalic, but Bonaventura's eventual pass over to Niang is poorly hit and fails to find the Frenchman."
32',action,"Suso gets himself into a good position on the right-hand side of the box and skips past Di Gennaro before trying to pick out Bacca with a fizzing pass across the face of goal, but Rafael sticks out a hand to push the ball away from the Colombian, who was ready to test the Brazilian."
31',action,"Another dangerous cross is launched into the Cagliari penalty area, but this one is cleared out for a corner by Luca Ceppitelli after initially finding Niang. Milan are unable to make the set-piece count, however, and the visitors easily deal with the danger."
30',action,"Almost a great opportunity for Pasalic! De Sciglio cuts inside from the right flank and fires a low cross towards the far post. It deflects off an outstretched leg before looping towards Pasalic, but, despite his best efforts, the Croatian is unable to pull off a scissor kick from close range."
28',action,"Bonaventura goes close! Alves climbs all over Bacca on the edge of the Cagliari box and concedes a free-kick in an extremely dangerous position. Bonaventura steps up and fires a wonderful curling strike towards the top left-hand corner of the net, but it flies just wide of the post after beating Rafael."
27',substitution,Substitution sub-out Ignazio Abate sub-in Luca Antonelli . Abate is still struggling after being clattered into by Alves and is eventually replaced by sub-in Luca Antonelli.
26',action,"Chance for Marco Sau! Abate is still off the pitch, so Cagliari fly forward on a determined attack as they try to make their numerical advantage count. They move the ball around quickly before Sau unleashes a rocket of a shot from 25 yards out, but Donnarumma gets down quickly to parry it away with a one-handed save."
24',action,"The resulting free-kick is fired into the heart of the Cagliari penalty area and isn't dealt with at all convincingly by Rafael. The goalkeeper flaps at the ball and can only push it down into the feet of Mattia De Sciglio, but just as the defender is about to shoot, the linesman's flag is raised for offside."
23',action,"Ouch! Abate flies down the right flank before trying to latch on to a loose ball, but he's clattered into by a hefty challenge from Bruno Alves that leaves him writhing in agony on the floor. It looks as if he's going to be able to continue, but only after a few moments on the touchline receiving attention from the medical staff."
21',action,"Bonaventura, who has been one of Milan's busiest players thus far, cuts inside from the left wing on a marauding run before trying to test Rafael from 25 yards out. There's far too much power behind his shot, however, and the Cagliari goalkeeper is able to watch it sail comfortably over the goal."
19',action,"Milan keep patiently working the ball around deep inside the Cagliari half of the pitch before Suso skips into the right-hand side of the penalty area. He does well to beat two players before taking on Davide De Gennaro, but the midfielder stands tall and comes out on top with a smart interception."
17',action,"Milan get themselves into a good position on the edge of the Cagliari penalty area after more patient build-up play, but Locatelli is unable to pick out Mario Pasalic inside the box and the ball bounces harmlessly out of play for a goal-kick."
16',action,"Bonaventura muscles his way through the Cagliari midfield before being dragged to the ground, resulting in a free-kick for Milan in an advantageous position. It's sent short before Niang unleashes a screamer from 25 yards out, but his rocket of a shot clears the top of the crossbar by a few yards."
14',action,"Cagliari are able to push forward on a rare foray into the Milan half of the pitch before Mauricio Isla tries to pick out a teammate with a cross from the right wing, but it takes a deflection off a Milan player that sends the ball looping into the hands of Gianluigi Donnarumma."
12',action,"Poor from Bacca! The Colombian is left in a pocket of space just outside of the Cagliari penalty area and tries to test Rafael with a long-range strike with the outside of his boot, but it's woefully hit and sails comfortably wide of the far post."
10',action,"Niang, who has been busy during the opening stages of the game, cuts inside from the left wing and skips past his marker before trying to pick out Bacca with a curling cross, but this time his pass flies a yard or so over the head of the striker."
8',action,"Milan keep bossing possession as they continue putting pressure on their opponents. Giacomo Bonaventura and Niang link up beautifully over on the left flank before the latter charges towards the box and tees up Bacca, but his pass is slightly too late and, as a result, the Colombian striker is flagged offside just as he's about to shoot."
6',action,"Ignazio Abate flies down the right wing and beats two players before swinging a cross into the heart of the penalty area. It finds Niang in a good position in front of goal, but his headed effort is blocked by Pisacane and results in another corner for Milan."
4',action,"Romagnoli pushes into the Cagliari half of the pitch and launches a lofted pass into the visitors' penalty area. It finds M'Baye Niang after the Frenchman did well to skip away from Fabio Pisacane, but the full-back recovers quickly to shepherd the ball out for a goal-kick."
3',action,"Carlos Bacca goes close! Cagliari are unable to clear the danger quickly enough and allow Milan to hit them on another determined attacking move. Suso picks up the ball on the right wing and cuts inside swiftly before teeing up Bacca, who spins round his marker and fires a thumping shot that flies a few yards wide of the near post."
2',action,"Milan quickly push forward down the left wing before a swinging cross results in an early corner for the home side. It's fired in by Suso and finds Alessio Romagnoli at the near post, but the defender's glancing header is well stopped by Rafael."
1',action,"And we're off! Cagliari get us underway, attacking from right to left."
,action,"The two sides are making their way out onto the pitch, with just a few minutes to go until kick-off."
,action,"Meanwhile, Cagliari boss Massimo Rastelli has also made two alterations to the team that featured in their last outing, with Bartosz Salamon and Simone Padoin making way for Luca Ceppitelli and Mauricio Isla."
,action,"Vincenzo Montella has decided to make two changes to the Milan side that started the Supercoppa victory against Juventus, with Mario Pasalic and M’Baye Niang coming into the starting line-up to replace Juraj Kucka and Andrea Bertolacci."
,action,"Cagliari substitutes: Pedro, Crosta, Colombo, Munari, Borriello, Bittante, Murru, Giannetti, Salamon, Tachtsidis."

,action,"There’s just over 15 minutes left to go until kick-off, so let’s have a look at how the two teams will be lining up this afternoon…"
,action,"The win, their seventh of the season, means that Cagliari now sit in 12th place in the table, a comfortable 13 points away from the relegation zone. Despite that, the Rossoblu have struggled away from home this campaign, with just one game ending in a victory. That came against Inter on this very ground, however, and they’ll be aiming to pull off another upset here today as they try to start 2017 on a high."
,action,"As for Cagliari, they brought an end to a frustrating three-game winless run with a hard-fought - and incredibly exciting - victory at home to Sassuolo in their last outing. Last season’s Serie B champions showed great grit and determination as they came from 3-1 down to win 4-3, taking some of the pressure off boss Massimo Rastelli."
,action,"The Supercoppa win presented Milan with their first piece of silverware since 2011, and they will be eager to build on that momentum as they desperately try to keep the pressure firmly on Napoli. The Rossoneri currently sit five points behind the third-place side but have two games in hand, making this a must-win game for Vincenzo Montella’s men."
,action,"Milan had to head into the annual winter break without a win in their final two league games after being frustrated by both Roma and Atalanta, but they impressed in the Supercoppa victory against Juventus in their last clash of 2016 and, as a result, will be fully expecting three much-needed points today."
,action,Good afternoon and welcome to our live text commentary of today’s Serie A game between Milan and Cagliari at San Siro.
